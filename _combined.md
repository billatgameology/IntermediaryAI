Hi everyone, it's me, Tim. I hope you're all having a good holiday. I'm secular, but I do enjoy a good Christmas, and I think if I could pull off a good Papa Hemingway, I think I can also pull off a halfway decent Santa Claus. Anyway, I thought that because today is Christmas, I would read an essay I wrote in 2002 at Troika, and this was while we were making Temple of Elemental Evil. I wrote it during the holiday period there. It's called "A Christmas Lesson in CRPG Design." So, let me just read this to you now. I wrote this, like I said, 21 years ago. So, there we go.

Every year at Troika Games, we have a gift exchange at Christmas time, or Hanukkah, or Kwanzaa, depending on who you ask. The rules are very simple: each person buys a gift for some pre-arranged amount of money, usually $20. They wrap it and place it under our Christmas tree. On the last day of work before the holidays, we draw lots to see what order we get to pick our gifts. Seems straightforward enough, but there's a catch. Instead of picking a gift from under the tree on your turn, you can choose to steal a gift from someone who has already unwrapped one. The victim then gets a choice: to take another gift from the tree, or to steal a gift from someone who hasn't already been robbed yet that turn. So, a particular turn isn't over until someone takes an unwrapped gift from under the tree, because either they don't see a gift they want to steal, or because every gift has been stolen once already. The whole event can be a little crazy and a little tumultuous, but everyone has a fun time.

I've learned a lot about CRPG design from this event. One lesson is obvious: always steal the best things you can. Every CRPG designer borrows heavily from past works, especially features that have become popular and even expected in a game. Remember when auto-mapping wasn't a standard feature in a CRPG? Conversely, a designer should expect his good ideas eventually to appear in his competitors' games. Don't get upset at this; imitation is the most sincere form of flattery.

Another lesson that should be obvious: turn-based games are still fun. Despite the plethora of real-time computer games on the market, there's still satisfaction in playing a game in the old-fashioned turn-based method we all grew up with in tabletop games. Some newer games seem to be real-time for no other reason than because real-time is more modern. Why make a real-time D&D computer game, which requires you to ignore or change all the rules having to do with D&D's inherently turn-based nature? I'm surprised no one's made a real-time chess game. I found out later somebody has. I'll even give you a good name for it: Extreme Chess. And don't forget the sticker: Now with fat loot.

But some lessons I've learned from the gift exchange are more subtle. For example, some people spend a lot of time picking out their gift, sometimes thinking about gift ideas for months before the exchange party, while other people just grab something during their lunch hour on the day of the party. There seems to be no correlation between how much time someone spent picking out a gift and how popular the gift is, where I base a gift's popularity on how many times people try to steal it. Sometimes a gift is really popular, and sometimes it's not, and it's hard to tell beforehand what people are really going to want.

Making an RPG is similar: you can have a lot of ideas, but until you implement them and see how other people like them, it's hard to tell what people like. Some people think that spending a lot of time on a feature makes it good. In fact, I've seen truly awful ideas that a person has spent months developing, and I've seen wonderful ideas that been implemented in 5 minutes. Again, you can't always predict what will be fun and what will not. You try your best and have to be willing to accept criticism.

Now, sometimes people buy gifts for the exchange that they personally would like to receive. Usually, they figure that their friends have similar tastes and would like the gift too, or maybe they're just being cynical, and they buy it to ensure that there will be at least one gift there that they want to steal. In the same vein, designers often add features they personally enjoy, usually with the same justifications: people similar to them will like it, they figure, and if they don't, well, I'm a designer and it's going in because I like it. Just because you like a feature doesn't mean it should stay in the game. If playtesters find the feature confusing, tedious, or just plain worthless, you should change it or throw it out.

Finally, there's always a person who brings the strangest gift to the party and afterward claims to have had a dozen good ideas but couldn't find any of them at the mall. For a CRPG, this experience reminds me of the old adage that ideas are a dime a dozen. It's easy to have an idea; it's harder to implement it, and even harder to take criticism to improve it, especially when there is a temptation to ship the game already. "It's done and bug-free." That may be true, but if the game isn't fun, then it's not done.

For the record, the most popular gift at a Troika gift exchange was an alligator cookie jar that, when opened, would say in an OCC Cajun accent, "Mmm, them sure is some tasty cookies." Remember, there's no accounting for taste in gifts or game design.

Anyway, I hope you all have a nice holiday. I hope you like that Christmas lesson in CRPG design.

About My Notes.md

https://youtu.be/P0NKR9R0XTg?si=luqAwZMUob2jv9Pe

Hi everybody, it's me, Tim. Today, I want to talk about my note-taking system. I've had a lot of questions about you know in the telling of these stories, sometimes I go into excruciating detail, and it's because I've always kept a lot of notes, and I'm going to talk about what that is. I'll even show you a few, but it's nothing amazing. It's not like you're going to leave here going, "I have a whole new journaling system in my life." I'm just going to talk to you about what I did and why I can talk about a lot of things with a lot of detail. Even then, I try to run some of my stories by people I've worked with to make sure, "Is this what happened?" because sometimes I read something in my journal when I don't remember it, but I wrote it down right after it happened.

So, just to start, I got my first job at Pegasus, which later turned into Cyberon, when I was 16, and I worked there until I was 20. I have no notes from them. I was a teenager. I was so excited that I had a job in the game industry it didn't occur to me to ever write anything down. So, most of my stories, and I don't have a lot, are like the highest highs and the lowest lows from that period. Everything else, totally forgotten.

**Grad School**

So, I went to college. I actually worked there a little bit in college, but when I took, when I was in college, I took a lot of notes, but then I went to grad school. Grad school really burns note-taking into you. I mean, from the very first quarter, you're, you only take two classes because I began in a math. It was a PhD program, but you got your Masters so the first year and a half was intensive studying, while you also had to be a teaching assistant. So, your days were full, and then you were up late at night doing incredible homework sets, just insane things. But the one of the classes I had assumed you had had automata theory, which my undergraduate computer science did not teach, and when I mentioned that to the professor, he was like, "Well, too bad, go learn it," which he meant go on my own to the library and learn automatic theory on my own. He said, "You have a computer science undergraduate degree. You're here to learn how to be a researcher and a teacher, a professor. Figure it out. You can teach yourself." So, I did. I had to learn automatic theory and then later neural networks, another thing my undergraduate degree didn't cover. And I learned neural networks so well that I ended up being the TA for the undergraduate neural networks class, but I had to teach that to myself, which meant I had to take a lot of notes, and also, especially when you turn in some really big problem sets, you expected to show your work, including references, and later when you did your research, you had to sometimes defend it not just written but in oral defenses. So, you better know your stuff, and you better have taken a lot of notes because if they asked you a question, you better be able to say, "Oh, that's based off this binary split tree algorithm first made by German Professor blah blah blah." You better be able to do that. So, grad school taught me to take notes.

A side effect of this is I know when I was telling someone my AD stories, especially from grad school. My Notes: I don't have to remember those because I have a lot of them written down. So, all that stuff about the anti-paladin and the 18 Charisma Druid, I have the notes on that. I've written it down. I mean, I could tell you some stories about that group. They're poor pixie follower anyway. So, I have notes, and because what would happen is after the sessions, I'd often write them down, and sometimes someone else there would write them down. So, we have these stories we can tell.

So, by the time I started working at Interplay in '91, I was a contractor. I mean, I was working at home, which meant I often had to write a lot of notes so when I went in once a week to talk to the producer, I would remember what I wanted to say. Also, as a contractor, you have to keep track of the money you're making because you're self-employed, so you have to do quarterly taxes in the United States. 

**Lotus 123, Excel**

So, I took extensive notes on exactly what I'd done so I could tell my producer questions I had so I could ask him and other people when I would go to Interplay once a week. And also, as I got paid, all this went into actually it was Lotus 123, and I actually have those digital files, and a few years ago, probably more than 10, I converted them to Excel, which I started using. I started using Excel probably, so there's a Lotus 123 in the early '90s and then switched to Excel in the late '90s, and then I started using a program for Microsoft called Microsoft Money, which has been sunsetted, but I still have the program running because I like it. So, I can basically go back to 1991 and tell you all the money I earned and all the money I spent, by category. That's why, you know, when I was talking about my Fallout 1 bonus, I went and looked it up. I know exactly what my bonus was. I know what all my bonuses were at Interplay. I know that I was, you know, when Leonard and Jason and I had to underpay ourselves because there just wasn't enough money to pay all the employees and the expenses of starting up Troika and ourselves, we just didn't pay ourselves, and that was a scary time because the, I'm still using Lotus, no, I think I was on Excel by then. It was showing a lot less money is coming in than it's going out, and that's why I ended up refinancing my house. It reset my loan, but it let me pay several hundred dollars less towards the mortgage every month, and I really needed that. It basically wasn't money I had. It just let me go into debt more slowly.

**Paper**

So, the beginning of Interplay, my finances were digital, but I tended to do things on paper. I'd write down when I worked on the first game I worked on there, Rags to Riches. I got everything from the producers on paper, sometimes napkins from restaurants we went to. I could have sworn I had one. I went to go find it. I cannot find it. I then went to look. I'm sure I took a picture of it if I threw it out. I couldn't find that. So, I remember the napkin, though, because I had a picture of Lucy Luster from Ranks Riches and then a message from her, which included swear words because we were at lunch, and I believe there were margaritas, but I digress. We, so it started paper. I eventually became more electronic by the end of Interplay. Sadly, a lot of that stuff was

 lost because when I left, I had to leave everything behind. However, I realized I kept, I would come home at night and often write notes at home. Those I still had. That was something I'm glad I did because by the time I reached Troika...

**Journaling**

I was keeping extensive notes, mostly electronic, but because I own Troika, every time I got a new company, I had the hard drive copied. I moved it to the new hard drive, which was always bigger because, you know, back in the late '90s, early 2000s, we were, things were expanding like crazy, so I could always keep the old stuff. So, I have everything. I have every image of every hard drive of every machine I had at Troika. So, that's why I have all my notes, all the design docs, meeting notes, everything. I kept doing that when I went to Carbine, but a big difference was I started doing a lot of it after work. I would journal, basically. I would write down everything that happened that day in a very, very formatted way electronically. It was like the date, here's what happened today. The side effect of that was I not only still have all those things because they were mine, they were intermixed a lot with a lot of personal stuff, which is why that Disneyland story, I remember being at Disneyland one day, and I journaled about it, and like, "This is a lot like making an RPG level." And then when I Googled it, I found out that Marty Sklar, the Imagineer, had written a book about how to put together Disneyland and how the Imagineers should be thinking, and I realized that all those rules apply to level designers, and I have a journal interviewing like, "Wow, this is amazing. I should do a talk about it." So, I did. At 2010, I gave a talk, and at Carbine, about that very topic, which I've done here, and I did it again in Obsidian a few, you know, 10 years later.

**Walking Away**

All thanks to the fact that I kept all these journals. Now, Carbine ended, not well. I'll eventually talk about that. It's not a good story. It has its ups and downs like every place, but it's not a good story, and I kind of like, I didn't really like talking a lot about how walking away from Fallout 2. It's the same thing at Carbine. It's just the second time, second and only time in my career, I walked away from a project that was in progress, but I'm very proud to say both of those games shipped, and I'm happy to say that every game I ever worked on, well, every game ever got paid to work on.

**Obsidian**

So, when I started Obsidian, I did not want to be lead. I told him that, which is funny because, you know, I was there for less than a month, and they asked me to be a lead on a Strike Team, and I'm like, "Nope." So, for years, I just was, basically my Tarawa, senior programmer, and I did some design on the side. I have very few notes from that period. It's one of the reasons I haven't talked a lot about South Park or Pillars or Tyranny. It's not that long ago, but I'm gonna have to do it all for memory. I did not take notes. I pretty much stopped taking notes in early 2012. So, within a few months of leaving Carbine, I slowly stopped taking notes about things until just I finally stopped. I did not restart taking notes until the Outer Worlds, and when I did that, I went back to paper, and I did that for a couple of reasons. One, I wanted it to be something I could keep, and two...

**Book**

I wanted it to be something that, I mean, I could, I could and did digitize it later, but it was nice to have this physical thing, and I still have it. It's this book right here. I'm sure people remember me having this. I carried it around everywhere I went, at work and away from work. It has this lovely artwork on the left, on the front, where I drew a little rocket, and it is full of notes, and most of them are just, you know, dates like here's a page where I'm not talking about the music I want. Music One ambient, how I want the module set up, transition music, main menu, combat music, and all that, and then I talk about the music styles I want to do. I mean, these are just the kind of notes I took so that when I actually met with the music director, the audio director, I'd be able to pull this out and go, "Here's what I want you to do." Sometimes I have meetings, and after the meetings, often at night, that night, I would write down and hear everything that happened, and that was important to me because I knew that sometimes I would forget things later. I mean, this is my beginning of my 40th year, so I've been in the industry for 30 years exactly when I started at Obsidian, and I just wanted to kind of keep my head straight and go, "This is the stuff that I want to remember."

**Journal**

Because I had all those notes, when I semi-retired, I kept a new journal. This is a journal I started. I think I started it. Let's see if I've got any dates on here if I dated these. That's so dumb. These aren't dated, but it's like here's post-apocalyptic idea number one, and it's two pages, and then you turn the page, and it's post-apocalyptic idea number two. It's just. I just. I wrote everything down. It's like ideas on setting and ideas on story and ideas on what unique mechanics it would have, and I have a ton of them. Here's me still trying to work out the shape stuff. I just have tons of ideas for things, on different apocalypse, not anything like the other post-apocalyptics, one different ideas of how to do stats or how to do perks or how to do exploration in a game. There's an outline of talks I wanted to give. My Lord of Light game design is in here. So, this is not even full, so I'm still putting things in here. I'm just not filling it as fast because I'm retired, and I don't need to do that, but I do have a lot of stuff that I could. I mean, if someone came up to me tomorrow with a bag of money and said, "You have to take that. You have to make a game," I wouldn't have to invent anything. I basically got a trove of stuff. So, I've taken all that, and I did, like I said, I digitized the stuff that wasn't digital. The Fallout notes alone are 80 some pages. I ended up writing this book, printed it out, solid. It's over 500 pages. It's my entire career. Like I said, I'm not gonna give this away to anybody. I've had a few people

 read it, and they said it was really dry. Also, several people said, "Well, it's kind of mean," and I'm like, "How?" And when we talked about it, they said, "Well, it's weird. It doesn't sound mean when you talk about it, but it sounds mean when I read it." So, hence this channel. People viewing said, I mean, I've had some negative stuff in here that I've said, but overwhelmingly, it's pretty positive because, you know what, after 42 years, I can say it was a pretty fun career I had. But some bad stuff happened in it, and I don't want to avoid that stuff, and I have notes that explain them in detail, but at the same time, you know, actually, I used to explain to people, it's like, "I didn't dig ditches, and I didn't save people through open-heart surgery. I basically made computers go beep boop." People loved the beeping and the booping that I made, but ultimately, I made games. I did not save the world. So, I try not to take it overly seriously. I think that comes across better in the channel than it does in my writing. So, that's pretty much it. That's kind of how my note-taking evolved over a lot of years and how I got to where I am now and even why I'm doing this channel.

Ambient Music.md

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim. Today I want to talk about ambient music. I brought this up in lots of videos, there's a whole video about Fallout's music, and in my making of YouTube, I talk about my big ambient collection. A lot of people asked about that, so let's talk about that because I have a very very large ambient collection. I didn't start listening to ambient until I was in college. In high school, I was more about the new 80s wave that was coming: Depeche Mode, flux Eagles, Tears for Fears, Human League, cars—that's what I tended to listen to in high school. When I got to college, I went to engineering school at the University of Virginia, and I used to go study a lot with friends I met there. Um, and it was interesting, we're all different. There was uh, Donna was electrical engineering, Layla was Aerospace, I was computer engineering. They had an apartment off campus that was nice and quiet; we'd go there to study. Layla put on an album she said, "This is my brother's album, but it's good to study too." It was Jean-Michel Jarre, Equinox. I don't think I studied that evening. I just kept listening to this album on repeat. I went out and bought it, bought oxygen, which I discovered I already knew because a local TV station I grew up right outside Washington DC, in Alexandria, a local TV station played it as their late-night movie background when they were introducing the movie. I think I bought everything by Jarre and I would, and a bunch of other ones. I used it in college to both study to and fall asleep to. In fact, I fell asleep to Equinox so much that I quickly learned that when I put the CD on, I would start to fall asleep. So, I stopped doing that. Ironically, I have the same reaction to vacuum cleaners; they make me fall asleep. I did not understand why for years. In college, if the janitorial staff would start vacuuming outside my dorm room, I would fall asleep, even if it's the middle of the day. My Mom finally told me that as the last of five kids, the only time she had to vacuum the house was when she put me down to nap. The other kids could be parked in front of Sesame Street, or would go outside to play, or would color, but the only time she had to vacuum was when I was napping. So apparently, I grew up associating vacuum cleaners with sleepy time. Anyway, I quickly broke that connection with Equinox. I loved listening to it, so I stopped falling asleep to it. From Jean-Michel Jarre, I got into a bunch of really good ambient: Tangerine Dream, Patrick O'Hearn, Brian Eno, Vangelis, Cocteau Twins, Ray Lynch, Angelo Badalamente, and Harold Budd—really good piano music here, but so that's what I listened to a lot in college. Then I went to grad school in California at UCI, and I still studied to this music, but I did a lot more coding as well. There's a lot of stuff you do when you're a grad student; you have to code because you're doing research. And as a computer science AI specialist, that's what was my degree was going to be in. I did a lot of AI research coding, so I would like to, I like to listen to ambient music for that, and for that, that got me into um, Aphex Twin, Boards of Canada, Delirium, Justin Lassen, Biosphere, Mark, Marconi Union, Moby, Mythos, Global Communication, Tycho, and Sigur Ros. I loved those. That's not all the ambient I'll go into what my a lot more ambient in a minute, but that's what I listen to a lot. Um, Aphex Twin I talked about influenced Fallout. Boards of Canada just blew my mind about what ambient music could be. Delirium, there's a lot of Delirium out there. Some of it is ambient, like Flowers Become Screens; some of it is ambient with a beat, like Surfinikin. I can't code to that, but I can't debug to it, make that what you will. Karma, I listen to on repeat while making Fallout, but usually when I was doing non-coding work. There's a lot of vocals on Karma. Um, Justin Lassen, R.I.P., uh, actually sent me his CD, uh, Through a Mirror Darkly. It was a great. Biosphere also, I don't think Biosphere made a bad album. Marconi Union, Moby's ambient stuff, amazing, especially his new, like, Long play stuff, like he's one called La, that's really good. Mythos, Global Communication, like I said, Cigaros, I didn't discover Cigaros until much later. Really good ambient music. So, in the context of work, I not only listen to this stuff while I was coding, but I also, I use it as white noise, and I talked about that in the Fallout one, where I was, I just could not code when there was so much busyness going on around me. So, when I was in a cubicle, I always had headphones on. Later on, when I had an office, I usually had ambient music playing really lightly out of the speakers facing me. You could barely even hear it in the hallway. I don't think you could, but I just needed that so I didn't hear people chatting down the hallway, I didn't hear the Xerox machine chugging away in the hallway, things like that. So, what I mentioned that I have all this online now is, I have it all as CDs. About the time streaming services came out, I discovered that a lot of what I had wasn't available on streaming. One of them, Heavenly Bodies, is an example. They had a CD called Celestial. Find it on streaming services. So, at the time, Google Music lets you upload your music, so I ripped my CDs and uploaded it into there and just used it as my private music library that I could stream, especially through assistants. I have one right back there. That's what I was referring to when I said I'll have all this music online. It's not something I can share with you, and it's not even if I can play here, but it's what I use to listen to. And I have lots and lots of different playlists that I've broken them down into different things. The two biggest ones are ambient and dark ambient. I have a lot more. I have piano, um, what I call isolation, which is very kind of dark, spooky, ambient. I've got one called chill, um, I have one called, um, background, that's especially to be played in the background. Brian Eno's Neroli is a perfect background CD. But let me, I'll talk about, I have so many, there's literally hundreds. I doubt if there's a thousand, but there's hundreds. So, let me go over what I think are some of the best ones in my ambient, and then I'll, some of the best ones in my dark ambient. These are the musicians

 slash band names. You can dive through their albums at your own leisure. Woob, for ambient, Woob, Amorphous Androgynous, David Sylvian, Ryuichi Sakamoto, Jaw Wobble, William Orbit, Nusrat Fattah Ali Khan, Future Sound of London, Ulrich Schnauss, Mystical Sun, Laraji, Solar Fields, Loess, Crown Invisible, Dilate, Hoover Network, Troika (the band, not my old company, good music though), Crown Invisible, Dilate, Hoover Network, did I said, oh yeah, sorry, messed up, um, Geodesym, Jon Hassell, Kevin Braheny, Howie B, and Hubert Noir, Dweller at the Threshold, Ben Jordan, especially Pale Blue Dot, that's an awesome album, David Helping, Cliff Martinez, General Fuzz, Cyber Zen Sound Engine, Mike Oldfield (also his brother Terry Oldfield; Mike Oldfield made Tubular Bells, Terry Oldfield made, I think it was called Goddess, but it had a really long track on it called Resurrection). Some of this music, by the way, has religious connotations. I don't care about that; I just, if it was good music, I like to listen to it. Uh, Miles Tillman, and the aforementioned Heavenly Bodies. Now, my dark ambient is, some of those, they made darker albums, but a lot of, and meet musicians, started doing really dark, heavy stuff, and you'll probably recognize some of these, but I move them into their own playlist because I have to be in the mood for these. They can be a little depressing or a little ominous at times, but my dark ambient favorite artists are Altus, Sephiroth, Jeff Grank, Wendy and Carl, Stars of the Lid, Scorned, Steve Roach, Mind Spawn (if you can find it), Robert Rich, Ian Boddy, Brian Lustmord (who often just goes by his last name, Lustmord), Numina, Pieter Newton (who was in Clan of Xymox; if you can find Pieter Newton's Sleeps with the Fishes, it is an amazing dark ambient CD), In the Nursery (which did a really cool one about The Cascade of Dr. Caligari), Synesthesia, and Arecibo. Okay, that's pretty much a big big chunk of my ambient artists. A lot of this went into influencing music for Fallout, for Arcanum, for Temple, uh, for Vampire, and, to a much lesser extent, Outer Worlds. We moved in a different direction than Outer Worlds, but these aren't even all of them, but they're certainly what I consider to be the best available ambient music. There's a lot more I'm listening to now. This is the stuff I actually own a collection. I just discovered Matt Richter. I don't have any CDs, but I listen to it all the time on streaming. His stuff is really really really really really good. Um, I've talked about things like Mourn, Lorn, but that stuff is more, which house, it's got vocals, it's got um, uh, it's more of an EDM, I suppose you'd call it, but which house is its own thing. There's another one called Castle Swords. There's, there's so many other ones that I could talk about here, but these are the huge chunk of my own personal collection. Experiment, jump around on streaming services, and you know, if you mention a few of these, it'll play them and then will play other things. I think you'll like what you're here, and you'll probably occasionally hear something go, "That reminds me of one of Tim's games." Anyway, I hope you like this walk through my ambient collection.

Ambiguous Grief.md
Youtube Link:
https://youtu.be/NQneB2h40ms?si=d0zdUc4ND-kJDReF

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim, and today I want to talk about ambiguous grief. You may be wondering why it's so dark; it's because it's not even 7:00 a.m. Uncle Tim has to go downtown today, so I have to film this before sunrise. But you're probably wondering why I'm talking about ambiguous grief because it's something that has to do with games. I finally found the psychological term that explains why I dislike certain features in role-playing games, but I will get there first. I better explain what I'm talking about.

So, you probably know what regular grief is. Regular grief is when you lose something that you had. So, grief is what you feel when a loved one passes away, or you have a breakup, or you realize you're losing touch with a friend of yours, and you guys just aren't as good friends anymore, or anything that involves that you had something and now you realize you don't have it anymore. That's grief. But ambiguous grief, which is what is ambiguous grief, sometimes I think called ambiguous loss, but I like the term ambiguous grief better, happens when you come to the realization that you will never have something that you always wanted, or worse, something that you expected to have. So maybe for you, it's hard to say what it would be for you. Maybe you thought you'd own a house by the time you were 35, or maybe you thought you'd get a college degree, or maybe you thought you'd get a game industry job, and you're coming to the realization that that isn't going to happen for you. Now, some of these things aren't ambiguous grief because they could happen, they could still happen. I'm talking about things, though, that you finally come to terms with, like I'm not going to be an astronaut, I'm not going to be president of the United States, and if that's something you really wanted, that's ambiguous grief.

Like for me, um, because I'm retiring, I know that means I'm never going to make a big multi-hundred million game. That's just not going to happen. Um, when I first went to the GDC in '94, the Game Developers Conference, I went to the big banquet at the end, and I saw people getting game developer awards, and those were awards that were given by their peers, and you have to remember, this is when I was in the middle of reading being all the Hugo Award winners, and I said, I like Hugo Awards better than Nebula Awards because Hugo awards were given by the fans and peers to science fiction writers where the Nebula awards were kind of given by press and editors. So for me, the GDC award was that kind of award. It was people in my industry saying we played your game, and we think it's amazing. Never got a GDC award. I am realizing, yeah, I'm never going to work on Fallout again. That's a form of ambiguous grief. Now, I came to terms with that, I thought I did decades ago, but now I'm really realizing, okay, even if all the cards came together, I'm backing out of the industry, so someone else will have to make that.

But okay, if that's ambiguous grief in your life or my life, why am I talking about it on this channel? Well, the biggest thing that annoys me in games, and I've mentioned this on a few other videos, is when you make a character in a game, and it's a perfectly legal character, you made it in the character editor, you're playing along, you're leveling up, you're progressing a certain way, and then you come to a point in the main story that you can't do it. And it doesn't matter how much you level up, doesn't matter how good you make the character from now on, this character can't finish the game. I've played some RPGs like that, and there's nothing more annoying. But there's also this sense of grief. You're like, I just, I love this character, this is the character I wanted to be, this is the character I wanted to see how the story would play out, but you came to something in the main story arc that just can't be done. Um, ambiguous grief can happen in more ways than just that, but that's to me, that's one of the biggest ones, which is why I always told designers on my game, you have to make sure that the main story arc can be played through with any kind of character. I can make it's why I played Outer Worlds, uh, what, 16 times, 19 times? I would make wildly different characters. I would put all the points in one particular school of skills. I'd buy a particular set of perks just to see if the game would let me finish.

But there's other things that can happen in a game that can trigger ambiguous grief. You may make a character and then realize I'm never going to be able to get this perk. That would happen in Fallout if you didn't make a character with certain attributes, certain special attributes. You may realize, oh shoot, there's a perk that requires that attribute, and there's no way to raise it. You may realize that you just hit the level cap, and you're not going to buy any more perks. There are no more available to you. You cannot get the perk you were building towards. But in other games, I've seen that happen with items, like I really wanted an item only to find out that it was restricted to a particular character class, or you had to do a quest line, and there's no way my character could do that quest line either because he was on the wrong faction, or he was the wrong character race, or some faction that I had pissed off was the only one that offered it, or I killed somebody who was inadvertently involved in the quest, so now I'm never going to get that item.

And there's other ones too, like you may discover you made a choice that made a faction unhappy, and that was not your intention, and now there's nothing you can do to make them happy because the designer decided once they had reached a certain level of unhappiness, they stopped offering you quests. So now, there's nothing you can do. You kind of have to live with the fact that that's what the game is going to be like from then on. And I know what you're thinking, you're like, well, I thought you were the big choice and consequence guy, and I am, but I think ambiguous grief should be avoidable, and sometimes, sometimes it is unavoidable because if you're playing a game with character classes and someone tries to play against class, like if you take a wizard and you're like, I'm going to put him in the front line, and he's going to attack everybody with a melee weapon, which for the wizard would probably be a dagger, you're going to have a bad game. And maybe you can finish, but that's an example of you just, you're playing a character that's just, that class that wasn't designed to be played that way, espe like, take a character with low Charisma, and then say, I'm going to be the speech guy. That's just, it's not going to work, and you're going to be unhappy. But I feel

 like that was telegraphed that if you were paying attention, you would know.

What I'm talking about with ambiguous grief in games is things that aren't being telegraphed, um, events that happen in the game, and you don't know that that's what's going to happen. We did that in Fallout, and it bugged me. It bugged me that people were surprised at some of the end slides, that the end slide would come up, and they're like, I didn't know that picking this one faction in Junktown would have this result. There was nothing that telegraphed it. Um, I didn't know that asking the water merchants to deliver water to my vault would cause a mutant raid to happen there. Now, some people may go, well, you can kind of think about it. Maybe it's a logical result, but what I prefer instead is for designers to think about their designs and telegraph the results to the player. B basically, make it possible for the player to discover what the results of their actions are going to be before they make those actions. Now, I don't mean that there's somebody who says, do you want to pick A or B? If you pick A, this will happen. If you pick B, this will happen. It doesn't need to be that literal and superficial. It could be more like the player told they're going to be making a choice, and they can research it, and maybe they're in a library, and they find out something about the monster they're going to kill, you know, that maybe it only attacks when it's, you know, babies are threatened, and then you discover, oh, you, the town that is paying me money to kill that dragon has been stealing its dragon eggs and selling them on the open market, or you discover that this one, uh, person who wants you to go assassinate someone else, that they said had done something wrong to them, the reason that other person did that wrong thing is because the one who's paying you had done something even worse years before.

So at that point, I don't mind making the consequence the whole thing gray. In fact, I like gray choices. It's like sometimes you have to pick, instead of picking the best good option, you have to pick the least bad bad option, but I think the player should know before they pick what's going on and what will happen when they proceed because it's sort of like saying the worst thing you should happen. We used to say when you're giving someone their annual review at work, the last thing they should ever be is surprised. That's not the annual review isn't the time for you to bring up, you know, you're getting your work done way slower than all of your peers. That's not the time to be talking about that. You should have been mentioning that months before. Similarly, in a game, the game shouldn't go, ah, you killed this guy, now you will never ever be able to join this faction, you will never be able to get this item. What should happen, happen before you ever meet that person, you should know that they're in charge of this faction, so killing that person will really make the faction upset, and then if you continue to dig, you can find out, oh, there's this rare artifact, but only faction knows where it is. So you don't have to actually expressly tell them, but the player who's paying attention would go, ooh, I really want that artifact, that faction is the only one that knows where it is, and she's in charge of the faction, maybe I shouldn't kill her. So that's what I kind of would always tell my designers later on. It's like, your results don't have to be stated, but if the player digs for them, especially in dialogue, some people, some players hate dialogue, that's why we always let you have an early out, but I want to make it so that if you had kept talking to this person, they might have told you something important, something that would telegraph the consequence of your actions. That's the point of all this. If you're making your game, and you want it to have consequences, at least that players who are paying attention understand what the consequences are for their actions. And I think it's true that if you pay attention, you can usually figure out the consequences for your actions, and that's true in games and in life.

So there, that's my talk on ambiguous grief.

Analyzing Game Designs.md

https://youtu.be/Jmq5bOpQ4O8?si=vQncwyLzQuioRmOD

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim, and today I want to talk about analyzing games. Now, I've talked about this before. I've mentioned on this channel that when I play video games these days, I can't turn off the analysis part of my brain. So, frequently, I find myself enjoying games less than I should just because I'm picking apart things. And I've said I don't want to go into specifics about games I do this with, but Bengala Fraka asks, "Could you make a video on how to analyze games critically with the objective of learning more about design?" I like that question; that makes me talking about this analysis something constructive.

So, what I did was I thought about all the things that I notice in games, and I broke them into kind of a chronology—how I tend to play through a video game, what I tend to notice, what kind of questions I ask. So, let me go through that.

Let's start with the intro. The intro could be anything from the cinematic that I see on its Steam page to something that they release before, you know, a trailer they release before the game comes out, to the first cinematic I see when I start up the game, either when the game gets started, or when you say I want when it pops up in the menu and says I want a new game. So, I'm calling all of that the intro, basically. I haven't done anything yet, but the game is telling me what it is. The first thing I always wonder is, I watch it and I'm like, "Am I intrigued? Is that a world I want to play in?" And I find myself frequently asking that because several times there are these intros that come out where all the NPCs are just snarky, and or the hero is like, "I'm a big jerk and I'm going to do this stuff. Don't you want to be me?" And I'm just like, next. I don't want to play in this world. I'm not interested in the character I'm being told I have to play, or the world I'm in. What I love seeing is things where it's like, "Oo, what's causing that? Or what made the world this way? Or I've never seen magic handled like that." That's what gets me involved in the intro.

The very next thing, and remember, I'm going to talk about RPGs here, so this is going to be a little RPG-specific. Let's talk about character creation. So character creation pops up, within a minute I'm asking myself, "Do I know what I'm doing? Do I know what kind of character archetypes this game supports? Do I know what effects any of these things have that I'm being asked? I'm being asked to change an attribute, I'm being asked to buy a skill or perk. Do I know what these will do?" Sometimes the description is really vague: "Makes you shoot better." Really? Do I shoot farther? Do I shoot more accurately? Do I get more criticals? What does this do?

For archetypes, it makes I look at games, and I'm like, "Huh, this is an RPG, but all the skills have to do with combat. I guess it's an action RPG." Or they say that dialogue is a path in the intro implied that you could make a talkie character, but either I don't see speech skills, or I only see one speech skill, and I don't see any perks that modify that skill. Makes me wonder what exactly are they going to have me do. So those are things I'm thinking during character creation.

Then I play the game. I try to turn off my brain and play the game for at least 10 minutes before I get all critical again. It's hard to do. Sometimes when I find myself doing it, I'm like, "Just roll with it, roll with it, Tim, see where this goes." But then, after 10 minutes, I usually pause and I go, "Do I even know what I'm doing? Do I have any idea where any of this is leading? Where am I going? Is there any hints of what the story is going to be? Do I even like doing this?" And I know two minutes, 10 minutes seems to be a little early for that, but I can tell you one thing that always jumps out at me within 10 minutes is the user interface. I always think about the UX at 10 minutes in, and I go, "Wow, there are already pain points."

Now, this is what I've said about, and why I feel bad for UX designers, because the interface is something that when it's really good, you don't even really notice it. But when it's really bad, wow, you notice it. I'm saying, in the first 10 minutes of playing a game, I can usually tell whether the user interface is going to annoy me or not. Some of the common pain points are information that I really want and want to access quickly and frequently are hard to get to. You have to dive down through multiple menus to get this information. Or if I find myself repeatedly doing the same steps in the user interface where I've just memorized it's like, "Click, bump, do," or if it's keystroke, it's like, "A, A," and then I'm at the interface I want all along. That makes me go, "Hm."

Often there are confusing menus, like the character sheet is hidden deep under like a status menu. Or I was playing a game recently, and I honestly could not find where my XP was. It appeared on the HUD when I got experience points for doing a quest or killing something, but if I just wanted to know where it was, it was hard to find, and it was like three levels deep in menus. An XP bar in an RPG where your progression is pretty much measured by your XP, I don't know who thought that that should be buried like that, but that was a bad idea. And something that was easily popped up within 10 minutes of playing, and I was like, "I don't know what they're trying to tell me here, but if they're trying to tell me that XP isn't important, uh, they're lying."

So then I go back into playing. Sometimes I write this stuff down at this point, but then I go back into playing, and then after the first hour, I stop again, and I think, "Does the build I'm playing feel good? Does this character that I made, usually with an idea in mind of what I wanted that character to be, like, is it fun to play? Is it feeling like how this character I thought would play?" And also, in a bigger scope, "Are these mechanics actually working the way I thought? And more importantly, are they working in this setting?"

You know, a good example of that is I make a dialogue character, and there's literally no one to talk to in the first hour. One of the clients I'm working for had me play through some levels in a game they're building. I made a dialogue character, which seemed like it was perfectly legal and possible, and I confirmed with their designers that that was a valid character. I then played an entire level for over an hour, hour, that had no one to talk

 to, and I was shocked. It was all combat, and occasionally stealth ways of getting around those combat encounters. There wasn't a single dialogue, and I just went, "Is this level finished?" And they're like, "Yeah, that's why we had you play it." And I'm like, "I have problems."

And I've played shipped games like that, that for some reason, the character I made didn't seem to be using any of his skills. And in the first hour, if I make a character that doesn't use the skills that I picked as my main skills, in Fallout, that would be a tagged skill, something's wrong. Also, within the first hour, I should be able to tell what the pacing is of the game. Yes, some games put tutorials, frontload tutorials, but if they last more than 10 or 15 minutes, and I can't skip it, that's a problem. That's why I don't look for this though in the first 10 minutes, but in the first hour, I will look at your story, and I will start judging it on its pacing. Is there, have you introduced some characters that are interesting? Do I get a hint at what the villain will be, or what the main story plot will be? Is there good pacing to it, meaning sometimes I'm exploring, sometimes I'm fighting, sometimes I'm talking to people? If it all seems to be exploration, or it all seems to be talking, or it all seems to be combat, bad. I played a demo on Steam recently for a game I was looking forward to, and all I did in the first hour of that demo was talk to people. Yikes.

So that's what I think about after the first hour. The next um point is a little vague. Let's call it the First Act. By that I mean the first major chunk of the story has manifested, you've played through it, and you've reached some sort of, God, I wanted to say denouement, but I'm not going to say that, but I just did, some sort of conclusion that isn't the ending. Let's call that the First Act. I stop myself after the First Act, and I go, "Okay, honest cards on the table, am I actually enjoying myself?" This is frequently the place where I stop playing games. I've learned by the First Act, I can judge this game now. I can judge its mechanics, I can judge its story, I can judge its interface, I can judge the art, although I'm not, my Art Bar is really low, not just cuz I can't do art and I'm color blind, but I just, I care way less about how a game looks than how it plays. But I ask myself, "Am I enjoying myself? Is this story any good?" The First Act has ended. If I don't think it's good yet, I don't think it's gonna get good. And I can't tell you how many games I've played where a friend of mine has said, "Oh, just keep playing. The First Act isn't good." And I'm like, "Then why should I keep playing? They couldn't even make the First Act good."

Now, I've also played a lot of games where the First Act was amazing, and then it kind of fell apart after that. But if you can't make the First Act good, you're probably going to lose me. And then, besides enjoying myself, I asked myself another question, which is similar but, "Do I even like this game?" Sometimes I'm enjoying myself, but I realize it's a very visceral kind of like, "Oh my goodness, it's fun to do combat, and I love the violence. It's the, I love the over-the-top weapons." But I don't really like this game. It's just, it's either I've seen this before, or the story's kind of meh, or after a while, I get tired of, you know, the death animations. Okay, I get it. They're over the top. What else do you got?

So, just warning you, frequently the First Act is where I stop. A few other questions I ask at this point are, "What is the game, and especially the designer, trying to get me to do?" By the First Act, it's usually obvious that they want me to be a good guy, or they want me to get to this town, or they want me to oppose this villain. Basically, it boils down to, what do they expect me to do? And what do they want me to do? And what are they even trying to force me to do? Now, personally, I enjoy games where I get to choose what I want to do. But I understand that there are games where it's like, "Okay, I'm expected to be the good guy, or ultimately, I'm going to fight this villain." I get it. But I usually ask, "What they're trying, trying to get me to do? And does it line up with what the game is making it make sense for me to do?" If the villain is doing something that I agree with, why should I oppose him? I've played a game, possibly even worked on a game, where I've questioned the villain in the sense of, "I kind of agree with the villain here. Why am I opposing him?" And there was no option to do so.

Also, I sometimes ask, "What is the most fun thing to be doing in this game? And does that line up with what the designer wants me to do?" For example, if stealth is really the most fun thing for me to do in this game, and I like sneaking by all your encounters, but the game is being sold on the richness of its combat, I will go, "Why? Why are these two things not connected?" It's interesting that some games, the designer wants me to do the things that aren't fun, or the game doesn't seem to be designed to do well, but that's what I'm being pushed into doing. Again, I can usually tell that by the end of the First Act.

Then let's get a little more vague here, after First Act, and just talk about progression. So, if I, if I continue playing your game after the First Act, it's cuz I liked it. But let's talk about the progression past the First Act. "Am I feeling like my character is getting more powerful? Am I feeling like my character is gaining knowledge about the world and understanding what's going on, and possibly can make a choice about what to do with it, do about that? And I can act upon what I want, what want I want my choice to be?" Conversely, even though I'm getting a sense of being more powerful, are there still challenges? Are there new challenges? Are there things out there that, while my powers do feel strong, they're capable of defending against them? I still want to be challenged, but I want be to be challenged by creatures that make sense. I, if wolves were hard when I was level one, and then got easier when I was level five, I don't want laser wolves to show up out of the blue and start challenging me. Let's have it makes something that makes sense.

And then, past progression, we get to the ending of the

 game. When we get to the end of the game, and it finishes, I, the villain has his silic, we have our fight, or I get around the fight, or I talk him out of it, whatever I do, the first thing I asked myself was, "Was that rewarding? Did I enjoy it? Did it makes sense?" That's why I hate when games do switcheroos at the end. Um, if the game offers replayability, which I love to offer, the first question I ask is, "Do I feel like replaying it?" Because a game that offers replayability but gets to an ending that isn't rewarding, or is nonsensical, I find myself going, "Why would I want to play this again?"

The most common reasons I want to replay again is that when I get the end, it is rewarding, but it also shows some things that didn't end up well and are entirely my fault, and were decisions I made. Knowing that, "Okay, that wasn't the nicest thing to do," like in Fallout, when I take the water chip from Necropolis, that isn't the nicest thing to do. Learning that Necropolis fails and all those ghouls die isn't shouldn't be a huge surprise to people. Finding out, "Wait a minute, they had that water pump. I could have fixed. Maybe I'll make a character with a higher science, and maybe I'll fix it for him next time." That's the kind of replayability I want, where the player looks at the ending, likes it, but goes, "I wonder if I could have done this, or what would have happened if I had been mean to these people, or what would have happened if I had killed these people, or what would have happened if I had saved these people." When games make me think that at the ending, that's when I want to replay. If a game makes me go, "What was that?" I usually don't want to replay.

So, I tend to write all these things down when I'm done. Some of them I write down while I'm going along, but I do try to get into the game and enjoy it. But I do tend to analyze things as I go along, and I hope, Bengala Fraka, I answered your question, and maybe you can think about games you're playing, or maybe the own games you're making, in light of some of these questions and chronological points that I've talked about are a good time to think about these questions. So, I hope that helped.

Appendix N.md
Youtube Link:
https://youtu.be/90Si9b2JbsY?si=dNSDgZPoP8LcxQMr

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim. Today I want to talk about appendix N. Josh James 582 asked for my thoughts on appendix N, which is in the DM's guide for Advanced Dungeons and Dragons, which lets me show off something I'm super excited about. I got Gary Gygax to sign this for me at a convention in Los Angeles in 92. And later, when I made Temple Volento evil, I asked him if he remembered. He was sweet and said he did. I don't think he really did, but he then said you mentioned Bardstown construction set, and I was like, maybe he did remember. Anyway, appendix N wasn't that big; it was the top half of a page at the box at the back of the book. What's interesting though about appendix N is, like Josh James, that's how I discovered Jack Vance too. I was looking through the list of authors that were in there, and I realized I have never read this author. And I'll say this, after it impressed like 15-year-old me but 40 years later, I'm super impressed with how this man can write. It's at a level I will never achieve, even if I studied and practiced and did everything. In fact, the very first, or actually, it's the second chapter of the dying Earth, the titular novel, he has a description of Missouri and the magician walking through a garden, and I'm just impressed with like, here grew trees like feather parasols, trees with transparent trunks threaded with red and yellow veins, trees with foliage like metal foil, each leaf a different metal, copper, silver, blue tantalum, bronze, green iridium. Here blooms like bubbles tugged gently upward from glazed green leaves, their shrub 4,000 pipe-shaped blossoms, each whistling softly to make the music of ancient earth. Right? That's so evocative and so nothing that I would ever be able to write. So I was hooked on Vance.

I also discovered Saberhagen, and this is my old book, the cover's coming off, of Empire of the East. Amazing book. If you ever read it, I won't give anything away, but if you read it, you know why I love certain genre tropes. Interestingly, in appendix N, I already knew about Lovecraft and Robert E. Howard and Roger Zelazny, so I was happy to see that D&D was inspired by them. I really, really tried to get into Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser, the stories written by Fritz Leiber. I tried really hard. I liked them, but I never loved them. I always thought they felt like Howard, Conan pastiches. I don't know if they are. I just couldn't get into them. Interestingly, I had a friend who loved Michael Moorcock's Elric Saga. Again, it just wasn't for me. He was very unlikable, I thought, as a main character. Not that you always have to like a main character, but he didn't. There weren't a lot of hooks in that character for me to like, so I get why people love that story. It's well-written. The main character is flawed, so you would think I would like something like that. I just didn't get into it.

Appendix N, though, that was me reading it in the early '80s. In the early '90s, I did something different. I've always read science fiction novels. I came across a listing of, I think it was in '92, of the books that had won a Hugo, and I loved the Hyperion books by Dan Simmons. I love the uplift books by David Brin. So I'm looking at this Hugo list, and I realized I've never read anything by Lois McMaster Bujold, and she had all that for the Vorkosigan Saga. I read all of the ones that won a Hugo, and a lot of it didn't. That's what I loved about the Hugo winners; it often inspired me to read more from the author that won a Hugo, even though those books didn't win a Hugo. Also, this is all before the sad puppy stuff, so I'm not going to get into that, but even at the time, I liked the Hugos better than the Nebula. The Hugos rewarded based on fan votes, where the Nebula was awarded based on, I think, editors. And what I found was it happened occasionally in the Hugo, but more in the Nebula, a book would win not because it was a good book but because you could tell they felt bad that they hadn't given an award to that author, so they decided to give the award for whatever book he had written that year. And I didn't like that. Certainly, sometimes Nebula books won that were not anywhere close to what that author had written as their best work, and some of their previous work was way better. So I'm just like, sorry, Hugos.

The funny thing about this was, this was after I started Interplay, so I would often read these books in my lunch hour. I mentioned it to people what I was reading. Chris Taylor, who eventually became the lead designer in Fallout, he wanted to read them too, and so we'd often trade books, so we didn't have to buy all of them ourselves. And Chris Taylor can speed read, which is totally unfair because I would give him a book, and he'd hand it back to me the next day and go, "That was great," and I'm like, and we talk about it. Now, one thing I discovered, I don't know if it was from speed reading or just the way people's memory work, but we could talk about it, and he had great recall of the whole novel. Asked him about it about two or three months later, he doesn't remember as many of the details. I asked him a year later, he had forgotten a lot of details. I don't know if that's because of the speed reading or just the book made more of an impression on me than it did on him, but I did realize that when we were reading these books together, I had to discuss it with them soon after we read them. But he blazed through it; he got way ahead of me. So he had to wait on his side. He had to wait for me to catch up, which I was lucky if I could read one of those books in a week, so he had to wait, sometimes months, to talk about a book. He would read a book and come in the next day, "That was so good, you should put it list next on your list," and I was trying to read through them in order. I don't know why I did that because for appendix N, I did not read through them in order. But I just tried to do that for Hugos, oddly.

And people have asked about all the books behind me. This is a tiny fraction, not because they're not unboxed. I went through, and these are almost all my books unboxed, but in 2006, I moved out of my house in someone, and I didn't want to store a lot of things, so I gave away a lot of books. And then again in 2020 when I moved up here, I had a lot

 of books, and so I ended up giving away a lot more, mainly I'd take them into Obsidian and put them on the free table, and they would all be gone in a day. Some of them that were so old or very specific, I took to a used bookstore up in Orange, California, and they bought some, and some they didn't buy, and then the rest, I again just tried to give away. So what's interesting is these books that I have, for me to still have a book like this, if I'm keeping Empire of the East, which I've had this since the '80s, this represents a book I absolutely love, and I highly recommend. Same thing with the Jack Vance. I bought the complete dying Earth collection in hardback because I love Jack Vance so much. He's inspirational to me and aspirational, but I know I can never write as good as he can. And then, of course, I kept all my D&D books. In fact, I have a shelf of all D&D books from editions one through five, except two, and I have an entire shelf of nothing but Judges Guild modules. I have almost all of the Judges Guild modules that ever came out, so I'm super happy with that.

But anyway, back to appendix N. I loved that an RPG book would include a bibliography like that, like here are things that inspired me to make this game. Because when I read those books, of course, you can see where magic comes from in D&D; it's very much Vancian because in Vance's books, you could only memorize a few spells, and once they cast them, they were out of their memory, and they had to memorize them again. Come on, next dungeons or dragons, that's exactly where it's stolen. Some of the names, Prismatic spray, gosh, there were so many of them that obviously came from Jack Vance's novels. If you read them, you're gonna recognize a lot of D&D spells being cast. I love that. I loved that he picked and chose a lot of elements from different things. There's Howard stuff in D&D, there's Lovecraftian things in D&D, the Mind flayers, the aboleths, those are all very Lovecraftian. I think that, like me, Gygax was very much a product of his times, so these are all books he read when he was younger, and he put them in his game. When you play my games, you will see a lot of things from books I've read in my games. And I think appendix N, if you've never read sci-fi and fantasy from the '30s through the '70s, I highly recommend that you go through appendix N in the D&D book. You can even find it online; you don't have to find an old DM's guide and go through some of those stories. They're a little dated, sometimes the ideas are bigger than the characters, meaning their characters will be a little cardboard, but I still recommend that you read them to see where D&D came from, which will give you a good idea. So if you know where it came from and you know where it is now, you have a good idea of where it may go. I've always been a big fan of sort of archaeological game studying, although I realize my games are now becoming part of people's archaeological game studies, so make of that what you will. I'm becoming a fossil, but I'm proud of what I buried. Okay, have fun.

Arcanum 2 System Extensions.md
Youtube Link:
https://youtu.be/IPEe0s6fjdw?si=TZotcTGJJIEY0rSr

Hi, it's me Tim. Today I wanted to talk about Arcanum 2, specifically the system mechanics extensions that I designed for it because I was reading through them recently and I'm like hey these are pretty cool. I kind of wish we had done this. Just want to point out before I begin, I do not own the rights to Arcanum; those are owned by Activision Blizzard, so there's no need to ask if I'm working on an Arcanum 2 or can make an Arcanum 2. I can't. Ask Activision Blizzard if you have any questions.

So I was going through my design folder from Troika, and I found one that was literally called Arcanum 2 system extensions. Most of them were in skills, but there were also schematics and spells and backgrounds. Now, real quick, we were planning for Arcanum 2 to be the Journey to the Center of Arcanum. What's important about these system extensions: they were designed with the idea that you could keep playing the same character, meaning you all probably already had a character that was fairly high level, so most of my system extensions occurred at the top of the skill tree, the top of the spell tree, schematics except for backgrounds, but I'll talk about that at the end.

So, my skill extensions were the most extensive. The first extension I did was I added something I called skill specialization. This was independent of the training, the beginner, expert, and master. In specializations, you could only get that once you achieved Mastery. So once you have Mastery, you could spend one character point and buy a specialization of a skill. Each skill had tons of specializations; I'm not going to go over all of them. I had at least four; a lot of them had five or six specializations per skill. I'll go over some to give you an example of what I did. Some of these specializations also had minimums of attributes or, in sometimes, other skills, so you couldn't always buy all of them.

I'll give you an example; I do all of them say for Bow. So there were four specializations for bow that you could buy once you hit a Mastery level. There was double damage, which required a strength of 12, and suddenly every arrow you fire will do double damage. There was Seeker, which you could get if you had a DEX of 20. You can now shoot arrows around a corner, so if you clicked on somebody and it only required the arrow to make one change in its straight line path, you could still hit them. There was one called Marksman, which also had a DEX of 20, which would increase the critical hit chance for all of your conch shots. Finally, there was one called recover arrows that required you to have at least spent one point and have a repair of two skill, and what it did is it there was a chance that any Arrow you shot would be in the creature's inventory if you killed them. So I thought those were pretty cool.

Taunt had five new specializations which included getting... I'm sorry, Dodge had five specializations included taunt, which would make other nearby people try to attack you, or evade, which would make attackers actually go off to your other increase the chance they were going to your another Target, which was interesting because those would work together, which meant if you were dodging someone, there was a good chance that either more people around them would try to attack you or they'd all go on to someone else. It was an interesting thing to do. Melee had six of them, which included everything from dual wield to doing knockbacks like the spell effect, and stuns, but you would basically be able to get those automatically if you landed the blow. Throwing had a bunch of extra things, including similar to Bose doing double damage and being able to throw around corners.

We had a lot of thieving specializations for backstabbing. So a ninja backstab meant the NPC Target gets no chance to report the attack, so if you kill someone with your backstab, no one knows. Pickpocket had things that reduced penalties for taking someone's wielded weapon or wielded armor, so you could literally steal a sword out of someone's hand or steal the armor that they're wearing. Prowling had a bunch of stuff that once you were prowling, you could do things like do an instant short range move like a mini teleport. While prowling, one of them was called camouflage, which meant if you were prowling in a tile that had foliage, you were considered invisible when you were in there, so there's no chance of you being seen unless you did an attack or made a sound.

There was one we called human fly that only worked with the engine. Sometimes we had facades in the game, and this would work with any facades were things that would look like the crashed blimp was a facade; it was a bunch of tiles that were made as one piece of art and they were laid down as one giant tile thing. What human fly let you do is you could click on any facade or wall segment and reappear at any tile that was connected to that facade or wall segment. So you could go up to one wall of a building and then instantly go anywhere along the perimeter of that building, or you could go up to facade like the craft blimp and instantly appear anywhere around that blimp. I thought that was pretty cool.

Spot traps had a bunch that basically let you one of them let you pick up any trap that was... oh wait, that was another one. Spot traps let you go over a trap without setting it off. If you detected one trap, there was a chance all the traps in the area on screen would also light up. Gambling, haggling, healing, persuasion, wow, all the tech skills got their own level six or I'm sorry, Mastery specializations. The one that really caught my eye was the tech One reverse engineering, which is if you had an intelligence of 20 and at least one degree in all the tech disciplines, you could learn a schematic by just finding an example of that item. So if you found an item in the game that you did not know the schematic for, just having that item boom, You Could reconstruct it.

So those are really cool, and that added a lot of stuff because there were five to six for all 16 skills, that added like another 80 points to spend things on. The next way I extended the skills was I added a training level past Master called Grand Master, and that made let you do things that even the earlier training levels and all the specialization didn't do. For example, the backstab Grand Master turned all backstabs into critical successes; they didn't have a chance, they all were always a critical success. The repair Grand Master meant a repaired item never lost its maximum health; you were just it was immune, you were immune to that. The Firearms Grand Master let you dual wield guns, so it was things like that that were really cool, but the Grand Master One not only took a character point and required Master training, but it also cost money and you had to do the Quest for the Grand Master training; there was no way to avoid it.

Now because of this, that added 16 new points that you could spend on skills. Once I did that to skills, I did it

 to all the Spells as well. So every College gained a level six spell called a lost spell from the age of Legends. If you remember Arcanum's lore, magic waned and waxed, and we were in a period where it was waning, so there were spells above level five that had been lost. In Journey to the Center of Arcanum, you were going to find age of Legend spells and get powerful enough to cast them. So some examples for that was the conveyance College had an evacuate spell that teleported you and the entire party, all your companions, to a distant and defined safe location.

The force spell got something called Full Spectrum Aura, which lets you do what Kurgan did, the boss at the end, which is surround himself with the shimmering feel that made him totally invulnerable to attack. Of course, you can't attack either; it's basically a shell that nothing can go in and out of it. One of my favorite was there was a mental the mental College got Mass domination, which when you cast it every NPC on screen and within a certain range even off-screen had to say versus magic, and if they failed, they all became your allies for a period of time and fought for you, and when it wore off, they had no memory, so if they weren't hostile dude before, they're not hostile to you now. That was a prequel spell. Each one of these spells cost a point but also had a quest associated with it, which was really a quest to recover that spell; it was you had to go find, you know, tablets or you know a dead person that you could speak with dead with, and they would teach you this age of Legend spell.

Also, I was making it so that any spell you could spend another point in it and it would make it better in a predefined way; it would either do more damage or the effect of it would last longer or have a bigger area of effect. It was dependent on the spell, but that meant you could if you had a spell you liked like Fireball, you could make a better Fireball and then an even better Fireball. But spells had to be improved in order, so if you had a third-level spell, you had to at least put an extra point in spells one and two before you could improve spell three. This created a ton; this was over a hundred new points to spend just on spells.

I did a very similar thing with tech schematics. I added a level eight schematic called your post-doctorate, and those are things like in chemistry, it was creating Napalm, which was not just created an area with fire, but if they went through it, they stayed on fire after they came out of it. There was an electro Cannon, which you could make from the electrical College, which would make ranged weapons into a powerful electrical ranged weapon, shrapnel mines, adamantine plate; these are all examples of things. Again, they cost a character point to buy and had a quest associated with them, and like spells, I put in that you can improve earlier schematics, so you could make a Molotov cocktail that did more damage or maybe you made more of something for the same amount of ingredients. So that was pretty cool, and again, you had to improve earlier schematics to improve it later on. That alone added over 70 new skill points to spend.

So those were all the things you got that I added toward the end of the game. One thing I did which was still backwards compatible with characters was I divided all the backgrounds in the game into three groups: genetic, childhood, and adult. Genetic backgrounds were things you're born with. Childhood backgrounds or things that happened to you when you were a small child, pre-teen years, and adulthood was anything that happened in your teen or early adulthood. So an example would be that is if you were The Offspring of a troll, that's a genetic background. If you were raised by monks, that's a childhood background. If you had military training, that would be an adult background. The difference between the base game is I let the player optionally choose one background from each category, so if you wanted to, you could be born under a sign, then raised by monks, and finally, you sold your soul, and you get all those benefits. So previous characters were still valid under this new system, but if you made a new character, you could pick up two-three backgrounds.

After that, there's a bunch of different things that I wanted to do, mainly with followers, change a lot of things that you could do with them through dialogue, combat formations, which we eventually did add to Temple of Elemental Evil, and I wanted to put different modes you could put them in saying do an attack without ever doing heal, or I don't want you ever Attack Just heal yourself and other people in the group. So you could basically adjust it so you could get party members that behaved a little more like what did what you wanted them to. Of course, none of this was ever done, but I thought people would like seeing the intention I had for Arcanum 2 and also if you're working on your own game, this is how I would redesign a system if your intention is to let you bring over a character who'd already leveled up in the first game if you want them to keep a character in the second game. This is how you put extensions onto the very highest parts of all of your character features. So I thought that would be interesting, and I hope people found that useful or at least of some mild interest.

Arcanum AI.md

https://youtu.be/NhIIydTvIcQ?si=kOuAw-ztG7vOjGl5

Hi everyone, it's me Tim. Today I want to answer some questions that have come up about how the AI worked in Arcanum. Before I start though, I should think it's funny. I just got a Google or YouTube analytics email because I've been doing this for more than 90 days, where it was telling me what videos were popular and what weren't, to try to give me advice on what to do. And the advice seems to be skewed towards doing things that get more people to watch ads because it told me these technical ones, well, those attracted fewer viewers and according to YouTube, they don't think people want that. Which ones do they want? Why I quit Fallout 2, why I quit WildStar, they want all the gossipy ones, which I think is funny because the YouTube algorithm is pushing me to do negative gossipy videos, because it says that's what people consume, yet when you actually look at the comments, what people are asking for are more of these technical ones. So, I'm gonna do these; fewer people watch, so be it.

So a lot of the questions around Arcanum's AI came up after I explained how procedural generation and prototypes, and things like that worked. You may want to go and look at those videos. I'm going to assume you already know about sectors and maps and things like that.

Probably one of the most interesting things about writing Arcanum's AI was when you were out in the world, when you weren't in an instance like in a dungeon or an instance building, in theory, everything's there, the entire world is there, but of course, we can't keep that all in memory, even with prototypes, we couldn't keep all the creatures in memory. So what we did, and I thought this was kind of clever, if you know the sectors are arranged on a grid, what that means is when you're in the center of a sector, by Design, that's the only sector you can see. We deliberately made sectors big enough, and the viewport of the game small enough, that when you were in the middle of a sector, that sector is the only one that had to be loaded. Then what we did is as you move towards a side or a corner of a sector, it would load up to those three adjoining sectors. Bear in mind that at no point can you ever see more than four sectors at a time in Arcanum, and that would occur when you're standing near a grid point where there's one, two, three, four sectors, that's the only time you can see four, often you can just see one. That what that meant is we knew we never had to have more than four sectors loaded at once.

So that's what we did, as you went towards one corner, we would unload the sectors you were getting far away from, and pre-load the ones you were getting close to. When we loaded them, in addition to all the art and everything, we loaded the creatures, and they would get heartbeats. Everything in AI, except for the animation system, which got its own ticks, all the AI was based on heartbeats, and these heartbeats were every two or three seconds. I thought there were two seconds, I looked in the code, and it looked like they were three, a heartbeat interval was defined as three seconds, so let's go with three seconds.

What that means is when the creature is activated, it gets its first heartbeat, and it's labeled first heartbeat because sometimes you want to do something special on that. By the way, if this reminds you of Unity, it's very much what Unity does, we just did this in 1998. I think it's just a standard way of handling this. So when creatures would activate because their sector loaded, they would get a first heartbeat that would tell them things like you're awake, you're active, you should be doing things, and this is the first time I've told you that, so if there's anything special you need to set up, so like if you're a creature, you might want to wield something, you might want to check your inventory, you might want to look around you, anything you want to do, do that now. You are pretty much guaranteed to be off-screen because even when you load into an instance, we distributed those first heartbeats before we fade it in. When you're approaching a sector, it's guaranteed to be off-screen, so you can do things that might look weird, like if you need to teleport to a particular position, or you need to start an animation, or you need to pull out a weapon, you can do that and be assured no one's seeing you do it.

Now, what's interesting about heartbeats, I said they were every three seconds, not really. What we did is based on your distance away, we would lower your heart rate. And we did this over the number of tiles away, and I think the maximum, beyond 30 tiles, we stopped lowering it, but what that meant was you only got that higher heart rate when you were near the player, and past that, you would start getting a slower heart rate and a slower heart rate. And the reason for this is we literally didn't have the CPU cycles to spare, giving full heart rates to all the creatures that could potentially be in all that space around you. So we slowed it down, and that was fine. If a character was supposed to be walking, and they got a slower heart rate, they would jump across where they were supposed to be walking, which was fine because you couldn't see them. If they were trying to decide what to do, they would only make decisions at a slower and slower rate, they would only look around themselves less often, and that's okay because you're not there to see it happen.

Now there were four basic AI states for any creature: not fighting, fighting, fleeing, and surrendered. I think fighting and not fighting make sense. Fleeing is what happens when you, most creatures had a flee state, which was what percent health you would drop below and then you'd run away. Some of them, that was set to zero, so they would never flee, and then the fleeing was, you would flee for a certain number of seconds, and then you'd stop, you wouldn't come back to fight, but you'd stop, and you'd go into not fighting. Surrender with something different, surrender was different things to put you in the surrender state, spells could do it, I believe there was a something based on your charisma that could do it, but in any case, once you went into surrender mode, you would just stop fighting, you would not start fighting unless a) you were attacked or b) your health got above a certain amount, and I think it was like 80, and then you were like, well, I feel healthy again, I don't need to, I don't, I will go from being surrendered to not fighting.

And the interesting thing about fighting, this is where all the interesting stuff happens, at least in my opinion, in AI. So when someone's attacked, let's call it attacker and victim, when an attacker attacks a victim, that attack is reported. There are two radiuses, one around the attacker and one around the victim. It's based on the loudness of the attack. So that's why stealth attacks

 were better because they were labeled as quiet. Every attack was labeled quiet, normal, and loud, and quiet had a very small radius, normal had a regular radius, and Loud had a really big radius. So when you attack someone, it would do radii around both the attacker and the victim, saying hey, it would send out an event either I'm attacking victim from the attacker, or I'm being attacked by by attacker by the victim. Actually, I believe it only reported who the attacker was if the victim could see the attacker, otherwise it just said I was attacked from, and it gave a location but no object. That was way, if you shot someone from really far away, things would run in your direction, but until they could see you, they didn't know it was you.

The cool thing about having those two was when the attacker said, hey, I'm attacking this, that's what tells your followers, or anybody who's on if it's an NPC, anybody on their faction, I'm attacking this guy, do you want to help me? For the victim, it was like, I'm being attacked, does anybody want to help me? People like guards would always help victims, otherwise, they'd look for people on your faction, and those who would help and who wouldn't.

When we first made this, we had the funniest bug where I forgot that traps were implemented as just doing an attack on whoever triggered the Trap, so the first time this happened, the trap went off, and I think it was a companion, they got attacked by like an arrow trap, and then they went over and they started punching the arrow trap because they were angry at it for attacking them, and it was attackable, it had health, it could be destroyed. Took that out and said hey, people realize that inanimate objects don't have intention.

And also, by the way, this announcement thing was the same thing was done whenever you tampered, and tampered was picking a lock, picking a pocket, or whatever, that was tampering in the AI system, and tampering was also done with a report nearby Mo, usually tampering, when I think was marked as being quiet, and that way if anybody nearby cared about you doing it, if they were on the faction of the person being pickpocketed, or I believe the lock had an owner, and they were on the faction, keep in mind guards helped every faction, then they would go in and see what was going on with the tampering.

And then, what other interesting thing about our AI was bodies. If you killed someone, the body remembered who killed them, they stored it away. Remember that in Fallout, we let you drag bodies, so you could get in your body and click something, it would drag to you, and you click and drag it, so you could get it away from if there was like a guard walking around or during the day there was a street people walked up down, you could get it off that area, and here's why. Whenever an NPC saw a dead body, they would look to see if they cared, and they cared if again they were on the same faction as the dead body, so friends, other shopkeepers, or whatever, or like I said, guards always care. So they would look, and if they were if they cared about that body being dead, then they would look to see who killed them, and they would start looking for them. Now, the killer, the it was called the combat focus, it was wiped after a period of time. I believe it's about 15 game minutes, unless the player was still nearby. So it was only wiped, it was only checked if the players if the if the player walked away, and it had been a certain amount of time, it was wiped, the players stayed nearby, it stayed on the on the dead body, so if a guard saw it, so-and-so was the Killer, and they start walking around looking for the Killer.

The way we made sure if the player wanted to hang out in one area, corpses would decay in 24 hours automatically, they would turn into a blood splatter, or if there's already a blood splatter there, the corpse should just be deleted, the blood splatter would go away in two days. So no matter what, in two days, all evidence of the crime would be gone, but that is one of the reasons we put in there is we wanted to let people be able to take out an NPC, take out a guard, whatever, and then drag the body to an out-of-the-way place so no one would see it. I thought that was pretty cool. I'm not sure how often people used it, I'd love to hear if you ever made use of that. I think we had a lot of people in QA that I would constantly remind them they could do that, and they're like oh yeah, I forgot, it was part of the testing plan, but I've already gone in about how testing plans back in the 90s and early 2000s were seen as a set of fun suggestions but not always followed.

Anyway, that's pretty much a big high-level view of how AI worked in Arcanum. The heartbeat drove what the player, normally what the NPC did, walked around their shop, whatever they were supposed to be doing by the usually by their social class, and then combat was driven by either turn-based or real-time, the NPC moved through those different states. So I hope that gave you some idea of how we did AI, and despite what the YouTube algorithm thinks, I hope people liked it.

Arcanum As A Windows 10 App.md
Youtube Link:
https://youtu.be/z-onK2K2_k0?si=NEoJBR3YCbOXYZAg

Hi everyone, it's me Tim. Today, I want to talk about Arcanum. I have talked about it before, but people often say, "What do you spend your time doing?" And I'm like, I've mentioned I work for a couple of clients, but I also love messing around with games as toys, and one of the toy games I mess around with is Arcanum.

And I did that about, I want to say it was about six months ago, this is November of 2023, six months, no probably more, probably like a year ago. I pulled up the Arcanum source code and recompiled it as a native Windows 10 app. Let's take a look.

So this is Arcanum running in a window on my Windows 10 machine. I recompiled it this morning just to have a fresh executable. It is interesting to get it running again, I'll talk about that in a minute. So this is our opening movie. I really like this movie, Blur did this movie for us.

So a while back, I played it and made a save game right at the start, so I'm just going to load into that. Um, so of course, you appear at the blimp crash site, everything's working. I can run around, uh, I can talk to Virgil, I can tell Virgil I would like you to go away now. Um, the sound's working, I just turned it off, but uh, it's interesting to go back and see this game years later, see all the interfaces, see what the art looks like, see how small an 800 by 600 window is on my desktop which is 1920 by 1280. So it's fun. I mean, this game is 22 years old, started 25 years ago, shipped 22 years ago, so it's old, but I just kind of wanted to show this to show hey, it is quite possible. I don't want to say easy, uh, cuz I knew the code, but also it was just me working in a few hours' free time, got the whole game running again in Windows 10 native.

Now, let's talk about that, let's talk about what it would take to make this a real Windows 10 game. When I first pulled up the project, the first thing I had to do was get rid of any SecuROM stuff. Luckily, it was that was something we uploaded the executable or something and it applied the SecuROM anti-piracy layer, rootkit, whatever it was, so I just took that out of the build step. So when an executable popped out, it was just a clean, un-anti-piracy-marked executable.

The next thing I had to do was disable WON. WON is the World Opponent Network that Sierra used that we had to add into the game so that we could have multiplayer. Um, when I disabled WON, I had to disable the multiplayer part of Arcanum because it relied on WON, and that's okay, that is not interesting, it's not something I was interested in, so I didn't do it.

The hard part, I then had to fix the hundreds of warnings and errors that the modern Visual Studio compiler threw. So it took a while to get through all those. I mean, these, we shipped Arcanum with, I believe, the highest warning level that um, we used when we compiled it, but modern compilers don't like certain things, and it threw lots of new warnings and a few errors, so I had to go through and fix all of those. That's probably what took the longest amount of time, and my guess is, I worked, I don't even think I worked a week, um, certain if you add up all the hours, it was less than 40. I may have done 40 hours spread over 2 or 3 weeks, but it was not a long time, and poof, Arcanum's running as a Windows 10 app.

Now, what am I going to do with that? Well, the first thing I thought I would do is, if I'm feeling up to it, I may go through and fix the many, many clouds of overlapping bugs that exist in Arcanum. Some of them were in the code, some of them are in scripts, some of them are in dialogues, um, a few of them are actually in some of the assets, so I may have to go in and tweak some maps. Um, I don't think we had any buggy art. I don't think we had any cu. I remember in Fallout, we had some sprites that got cut too big and caused issues, but I think we caught all of those before Arcanum shipped. So fixing bugs could take, that could take months or years, and it would be redoing work that people have already done, but I want to actually go in and change the actual code, recompile everything, get it working fresh. I don't want to patch it, um, I don't want to go in and alter the executable, I want to change the actual source code.

The other thing I want to do is optimize the game for current Windows. When I was running around, it was a lot of tearing, um, were because this run ran under what, Windows 95, Windows 2000, we handled a lot of memory management that now you can just turn over to Windows. The fact that we manage memory that Windows is subsequently managing is just double management and a big slowdown. I would probably just change it so we just ask for memory and use whatever Windows gives us.

I would also switch this over to Modern DirectX. This is using, I believe, DirectX, whatever was available in probably around 2000. I don't think we switched over in 2001, but we might have, but it's a very old version of DirectX. Everything still works because yay for Microsoft backwards compatibility, you know, obviously the graphics are working, the sound's working just fine, it's pretty impressive that that worked without me touching it, but there were some odd things about hooking in DirectX 9, so I probably go to a new DirectX.

Third thing I do is make a balance pass. I don't even want to start talking about harm, but spells need balancing, the scripts need balancing. I don't want to change their base functionality, but I do want to make it so that harm isn't the go-to spell, um, either throwing in a maximum of how much damage it scales up to or putting a cooldown on it, something, um, it's just too powerful as it is, and there's some other spells that do that. I'm also going to make a pass through all the skills and the tech schematics. I may even look at the attributes. I don't know if I don't want to tweak things too much. I still want it to be Arcanum, but I just want to make sure things are more balanced than what we shipped with because I've mentioned this before, we kind of shipped Arcanum as an alpha. We had very little time to go back and do any of this.

One thing I might do, because that the code is still there, I could put back in the original multi-point cost for things, so that instead of everything costing one point, spells cost more, higher-level spells cost

 more, higher-level, uh, schematics cost more, and I can make that an option that you select when you make a new game, so you can play with the one-point method, or you could play the multi-point method. I know some people didn't like it. I have a video about talking about what the multipoint method was and what I thought broke when we made one point, but I put it in there as an option.

The other thing, though, I think I might do, I haven't decided, I might toss real-time because balancing everything will be hard enough, but balancing it for both turn-based and real-time, that will probably be a nightmare. I thought about making it an option, and maybe, thank you, Windows, maybe you can select it when you start a game or maybe even switch back and forth, but I think, I think a better thing would be just lose real-time altogether but then add some of the turn-based options I put in later games, like letting monsters take simultaneous turns, so basically, you take a turn for every person in your party, and then all the, uh, monster and NPCs go at the same time, so I could put things like that in relatively easy, uh, because I, of course, still have the temple code as well.

But these are just things I'm thinking about doing, want to play around with it, so I wanted to show it, just to remind people, I own the code, but I do not own the IP, which means I can't release this, and I can't make an Arcanum patch or Arcanum 2. That's up to the current IP owner, which as of November 2023 is Microsoft.

Anyway, I thought it was fun to do this, uh, probably going to look at some of the other games, you know, Temple and vampire, and see if I can get them up and running, see how they run under modern Windows. Uh, there, both, both of those would be a little harder because there were a lot of programmers on Temple, and I was doing design on Temple, and vampire's based on a very, very old version of source, and most of that code, I mean, I did boss AI for it and some code consolidation for things like throw and some other stuff that lots of creatures did, that would be harder. But Arcanum, I wrote a big chunk of it, and what I didn't write, I knew about because we had frequent meetings, and there were really only four or five programmers total on the game, so Arcanum was something I could get up and running pretty quick, and I thought you'd like to see it.

Anyway, there's Arcanum as a Windows 10 app.

Arcanum Attribute Effects.md

https://youtu.be/KF8yjlIZz9A?si=BZwT63G23Ex0x1qn

Hi everybody, it's me Tim. Today I want to go over the effects of the attributes in Arcanum. Yesterday I talked about the effects of the special attributes in Fallout people really seem to like that. So I did I'm going to go through Arcanum today. Let me address yes my shirt is super wrinkly. I got this at the very bottom of the box I found in the garage it is when we shipped Arcanum and yet this is an Arcanum shirt I'll show you got a picture of Arcanum on the back this when Troika made these shirts everybody got two shirts because we know people like to keep one this one was immediately folded unwashed and it's been at the bottom of a box now for 20 probably about 23 years give or take a year and it it smells a little funky the dog liked it as soon as I finish this I'm probably gonna take it back off because there is an odor coming off of it anyway.

This Arcanum one is going to be like the Fallout one in that I'm going to talk about what it does for players I'm not going to talk about stats being used as prereqs and again I'm not going to talk about the script I'm just going to talk about systemic effect of stats this one was much easier to do because since last year I had figured out how to get Arcanum to run under a modern modern compiler Visual Studio I just brought up visual studio and said for each stat like stat strength I just said find all references and boom there's a list of every place in the code that stat is referenced so it was very easy for me to go through and make this so let's begin.

So I'll start with strength strength doesn't affect any skills in Arcanum it factors into your hit points it factors into your carry weight and therefore determines how encumbered you are it gives you a damage bonus with any melee weapons and if you take it to 20 that damage bonus is increased beyond what the formula says it should be so you get a really much more powerful damage bonus it also has a so it gives you a two hit role penalty if you ever use a weapon that has a Min strength any kind of weapon melee or ranged and it also increases the throw range of any Throne weapon.

Stat Dexterity pretty good stat dexterity like Fallout probably went overboard it's it affects the following skills bow Dodge melee throwing backstab pickpocket and pick lock it also improves your AC it also improves your speed and if your dexterity is 20 it improves your speed much more than the formula would indicate so you get a crazy fast speed if you have a 20 decks um also there's I don't know why I did this there was a it said if you're in the code there was a line that said oh if you have a level 20 dexterity you can never slip on an icy tile then below it is the formula for it for checking slippage and next to it is a comment I don't know if it's my comment or another programmers it read a little bit like Jesse Reynolds but it wasn't signed usually we put like TDC or jlr or you know we put their our initials at the end of it it just said according to this formula nobody with a 13 decks or higher will ever slip on an icy tile and they're right so 20 dexterity was supposed to also give you that non-slip bonus but it looks like that happens if you have at least a 13. the way the code is set up so next is Constitution Constitution doesn't affect any skills Constitution doesn't affect your hit points but it does make your hit points heal faster so you get them back at a higher rate the heal rate is higher Constitution does factor into how many fatigue points you have it also not only increases your base resistance to poison but also increases your poison recovery rate and if your Constitution is 20 you're completely immune to poison it skips it in the in the saving throw check for poison it just says you have a 20 return succeed so it doesn't matter whether it's a super virulent poison or magical it doesn't matter it you can't be poisoned Constitution is also used for saves besides poison it's used for saving versus stun and if you do get stunned the higher your Constitution the less the duration of the stun it also increases your save for being crippled on an arm or leg or for being blinded.

Beauty okay the next stat is beauty poor Beauty my a lot poor orphan stat beauty doesn't affect any skills and the only thing it does in the game is adjust the initial reaction modifier that an NPC has to you before you open your mouth and use a speech skill or say anything yes like some of the other stats if you have a beauty of 20 it increases that initial reaction much higher than the formula says it should in fact I don't think anybody can be I know they can't be below neutral to you I don't even think they can dislike you or I think they have to like you um at least until you open your mouth that's all it does Beauty really should have done other things but I guess not being a beautiful person I couldn't think of anything Beauty should do until now let's talk about intelligence intelligence and Arcanum affected a lot of skills gambling heal repair Plus if you took a 20 intelligence every skill got a Bonus when it was rolled as if it was 10 points higher which is amazing for a level 20. um intelligence also was used as the minimum to cast a lot of spells including if that spell was on a scroll so you had to be smart to cast it and also smart to even read it it so in Arcanum you could maintain a spell so if you cast a spell that had a a duration that meant you were it was one of the maintained ones you got a little icons showing you were maintaining it the total number of spells you could maintain was proportional to your intelligence all of the tech degrees had minimums on them as well minimum intelligence plus as you probably are aware if you played Arcanum it we had done dialogue lines in it as well but we extended beyond what we did on Fallout we also had dumb Quest entries so when you got a quest the entry in your Journal was a dumb version which some of them were hilarious because of course someone asked you to do something and you didn't understand what they asked and what's in your Journal isn't going to help you because you're the one writing your Journal so the journal also has a very dumb entry that sometimes makes you go what am I supposed to be doing for this person and rumors I don't know how many people have used this system but you could buy rumors off people you know somebody in a dialogue could say Hey you could say hey do you have you heard anything going on what's the gossip and that was part of the procedural dialogue system if you asked for a rumor the it would you get an entry in your in your log as well and those entries were also written in a dumb fashion so even though the person have told you what the rumor was what you wrote down was dumb me leading you to go I I don't remember what the rumor really was ah intelligence so let's move on to perception perception was used for the prowling skill spot traps firearms and disarm traps the perception skill was also used for the player to detect prowling enemies so the higher your perception the easier it was for you to spot them and you usually spotted them farther away the bonus for having a 20 perception was that even worked on invisible characters you could spot an invisible character as if they were just

 prowling perception also reduced the range penalties for any skill this mostly was used for combat skills but it was true for anything so past a certain distance a lot of skills said I'm gonna you take a penalty that penalty was reduced so the higher your perception was it pushed out the range to which distance penalties began to be applied so willpower willpower only affected the haggle skill willpower also factored into hit points but at half the rate that strength and Khan did so every point in strength and Khan counted double what every point in willpower did for hit points similarly for fatigue fatigue uh willpower factored into fatigue but at only half the rate of Constitution so for every point of con you got twice as many points of fatigue as for a point of willpower willpower furthermore was used as minimums for many spells it gave resistance to some skills I think they were the speech skills but the part of the code just said when someone was calling in for a skill resistance and the similarly it gave your resistance to any spell that said it was willpower resistant and if you took a willpower of 20 you ignored those spells those spells would not work on you.

Charisma and then for Charisma Charisma was an interesting one it had when I told Visual Studio to search for a stat Charisma it found the most references of any stat in the game first of all it only controlled one skill persuasion it but it also controlled how many followers you were allowed to have it was your charisma divided by four rounded down it looks like also when you're when you told a follower to wait somewhere they would wait for a certain length of time and when that time expired they would go back to wherever their home point was which for most of them was where you found them but I think Virgil didn't go back to the crash side I think he went back to some Temple so they had a home point which may be different than where they spawned um with a higher Charisma followers got less angry at you when their waiting time expired because if you told them to wait somewhere and they hit their patience limit they would lose a little reaction to you so the next time you found them they might be a little snippy with you what surprised me though was the number of locations in code where we checked to see if Charisma was 20. so these are all the bonuses you get for setting your charisma 20 in Arcanum first of all followers will wait forever it's not that they won't get angry at you if you tell them to stay somewhere they will stay in that location forever so I hope you remember where you left them also followers Will Never Surrender or flee for any reason spells can't make it happen um it can't happen through a dialogue it can happen because you did bad things they will never surrender a fleet also its followers will switch to you even if they're already listed as a follower of someone else if you have a Charisma of 20. I was confused by that because I wasn't sure if NBC's ever marked people as followers but then I remembered oh yeah we have multiplayer which means in a multiplayer game you can actually steal another players follower by having a conversation with them saying hey come follow me also a follower will always disband if ordered to at level 20 but they will disband for no other reason so they will never leave you unless you flat out order it and finally at level 20 followers will never get a negative reaction adjustment to anything the player says or does so once you hit Level 20 that's the minimum there ever that reaction will ever be towards you and anything you do that's positive will get added in and it will never lower down again so you can easily once you hit Level 20 make all your followers love you and I thought that was pretty cool so that was the effects of all eight stats but then I noticed something in the compiler I talked about what I call the one point Fiasco where I was convinced to reduce every cost of every stat and every I'm sorry every attribute every skill every Tech degree everything in the game to costing one point I thought we did that in data I found a conditional compilation flag in arcanum's code which means you can turn it on and off and it will go back to the old system because it looked like at least for where I saw it for attributes and I think it was in skills there was a data array it wasn't kept externally as a data file now I didn't dive into this it may still be that spells and Tech degrees have their minimums kept in their data but it occurred to me that I could recompile it with that flag it what I might do I don't know but I might I might recompile it and play it both ways play it the original way where it cost more ex more and more points per level to buy things up and the way it shipped which is one point just to see if I still feel the same way because a lot of you in the comments were saying you think the one point system is great and it's what made you love Arcanum and I'm like okay maybe I should try it maybe I should go back and forth and see now 20 years later what I think of it if I do that I will let you know and tell you if I change my mind but now I really have to get out of this shirt because it spells so have a good day

Arcanum Combat Real Time vs Turn Based.md
Youtube Link:
https://youtu.be/-QUDeipApgU?si=f_45tC4PDsaRis0K

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim. Today I want to talk about arcanums various combat modes: the real time, turn-based, and fast turn-based, kind of what the ideas were behind that, why it's even in the game, um, what I wish I had done differently.

So, go back to 1998, we had originally specced out Arcanum before we talked to Sierra. We had a rough outline of what we wanted to do, and we were planning to make it turn-based. We wanted to do turn-based. Coming off Fallout, we understood turn-based. Turn-based RPGs have something that I really like, which is, as I've said in another video, when I cast a spell, especially a spell that has an area of effect, and especially in an isometric game, when things are moving around while I'm casting it, that drives me insane. I mean, I liked Baldur's Gate, but that drove me insane to try to cast like a fireball in that spell. Sometimes the people I was trying to hit would move out; sometimes one of my companions would move in. By the time I clicked in the spell, I cast it, and it went off and blew up, who knows what was being hit. Didn't like that.

However, when we got into deep talks with Sierra, they really insisted on multiplayer, and at the time, their argument was they didn't think that single-player RPGs without a multiplayer component would sell very well. That meant that we had to do real time, and what they really wanted was just to make the whole game real time. Now, if I had had my way, which I did not, I would have suggested dropping multiplayer and real time and just doing turn-based and balancing for that.

So, because I didn't get my way, what should have happened, and it didn't, and I point this out because some people are, even though I talk about watching my stories with nuance and understanding that I'm not always the good guy or I'm not always making the right decisions, even if I'm trying to be the good guy, what I should have done here is dropped to turn-based and just made the whole game real time and balanced for that and made the spells for that and just gone that way. I mean, there was an ample number of examples of games I could have used as a template for how to do real-time combat. In fact, when I really got into EverQuest, one of the things I loved about it was that concentration skill because every time you got hit, you rolled against the concentration skill to see if you kept casting, which added a depth to spellcasters because you not only had to be smart, so you had all your and have your spells, and you know you wanted all these other skills and stats, but you really wanted concentration too, so you wouldn't get interrupted when you were cast.

In any case, what happened was we decided to keep both, and I thought I could do it, and I was wrong. What ended up shipping was unbalanced for both real time and turn-based. We tried to balance them through the same place we calculated action points for turn-based. We calculated how fast you should be doing your animations and attacks in real time. We thought that would balance it; it did not.

We added the fast turn-based mode because I was trying to convince Sierra, hey, turn-based can be pretty topping; it can go pretty well because fast turn-based basically skipped the animations on someone's turn. So if you clicked somewhere, it didn't bother to show you walking, or I don't even think it showed combat animations. It just boom, calculated your turn, a number would fly off, and it would continue.

Now, what's interesting is I had a lot more ideas on what to do with turn-based, but by the time we got the basic stuff implemented in real time and all the other features in the game, which I've said in other videos, I really should have edited some of them out. I know people like newspapers, and they liked a lot of other features in the game. We just had too many features in that game; we couldn't get them all coded, debugged, and balanced in a reasonable amount of time with a dozen people working on the game. So some things should have been cut. However, saying that, there were a lot more ideas I have for turn-based that I wish I had explored. I already said in a previous video that one of the things I taught I thought about for turn-based was just making whenever enemies had consecutive turns, just collapsing them, and they all go once on that turn, and even more than that, just giving one initiative role to all enemies. So if it was just you fighting, you'd go, and then all the enemies would go, and then you'd go, and all the enemies would go. If you had a party, you'd move someone in your party, maybe someone else in your party, then all the monsters would go, and then a couple more people in your party would go.

What's cool about that is, I talked about when I did some experience with that later, it, the pros and cons of letting enemies go in one turn seem to balance out. Kind of wish I'd done that. Some other turn-based ideas I had was to separate movement and combat action points and do separate pools. So the way that would work is, you roll your initiative, and then in initiative order, everybody moves. So they do, they decide where they want to be on the board, then in initiative order again, everybody gets to do non-movement stuff. They can drink a potion, they can throw a spell, they can do an attack.

That's interesting. Some of the ideas I had to make alternatives for that, um, because I've played around with it in my little toys, is you move in your initiative order, and then the action is in reverse initiative order, meaning the first person to move the last person to get his combat attack. And that had interesting things because, basically, you know, the fast people would move quickly, but then the slow people would move and then immediately get to attack. So that led to some interesting things where if you had seen a melee guy come at you, and your range guy, you could step away, do your ranged attack, and then the melee guy wasn't next to you to attack. So it gave advantages to wanting to go first and disadvantages to when you go first. That was interesting.

Another one was completely separate initiative rolls for the move in action points. So what would happen is everybody wrote initiative and move, then everybody would roll initiative again and do their action points. I really like this one because any bonuses you had to that initiative roll worked in both of them but weren't guaranteed. So maybe you'd move early in the move phase, but then the action phase you roll badly, and you attack near the end. Now, if you have a really good bonus, chances are you're going to move early and attack early, but it's not guaranteed. And I like that sense of not gambling but randomness that was thrown in there because it basically meant your bonuses were just that, they were good, but they didn't guarantee anything. The lowest agility, slowest character in the entire set of party members and enemies might roll really well and move first, and then might roll really well again and attack

 first. It was not common, but it might happen. It's the same reason I like criticals. I like the fact that a battle can be going really badly, and then you suddenly get a critical success, and it turns it. Similarly, occasionally a battle can grow really well, and you're getting a little arrogant about it, and then you critically fail, and your weapon explodes or something. I love that.

So, it's funny I have a point on this. I did this to answer someone's question about why we even had real time in Arcanum, and it's because of multiplayer, and why we ended up with real time and turn-based, that was my bad decision. But my point here at the end is I don't think turn-based RPGs have been completely mined, not even close to being completely mined on fun, engaging mechanics that you could do for turn-based. I think there was just a quick rush into making RPGs real time, and then when some people went like, whoa, you know, I don't necessarily want real time, they introduce Real Time with pause, which for me didn't address any of the problems I have with real time, which isn't that people are moving around, it's that I can't do area of effect spells when people are moving around.

I think that there's a whole bunch of turn-based variations that could be explored. I kind of hope they are. I wouldn't be surprised if they are being explored in the Indie space. The Indie space is so huge; I can't even keep up anymore with what's going on. I mean, if you know of any turn-based RPGs that have some really unusual turn-based combat mechanics, let me know in the comments. I would like to check them out. I just really like the space of turn-based, and I'm always imagining what could be done there, and I just feel like it's a part of RPGs that feels like, especially as we went first person, they're just being left behind, and we're not going to see anymore, and I think that's unfortunate because I think there's a lot of cool stuff there.

Anyway, hope that answered the Arcanum question, hope that gave you things to chew on for turn-based combat.

Arcanum Criticals.md

https://youtu.be/8g0aLMYxl4A?si=Oe9VMXZn87gKb1gO

Hi everyone, this is Tim. Today I want to talk about how criticals work in Arcanum. Sounds like a simple question, I completely went down the rabbit hole. In Arcanum's code, I think I mentioned once that Arcanum was very much our "everything in the kitchen sink" game, and I think every single idea that anyone ever had about criticals, whether it was combat or not, whether it was success or failure, went into Arcanum. So if this is something that interests you, keep listening because I have an awful lot of stuff to go over. Okay.

Let's talk first about when you use a skill, any skill in Arcanum, what's the chance it succeeds. Okay, that is based on your skill level, so the more ranks you have the more chance it has to succeed. Training also affects it, and you have to read every skill has different effects specifically to that skill. For any skill though, if it's used at anything at range, if it can be, especially like, you know, a ranged weapon or something you're throwing, that range is adjusted by the user's, I'm gonna say attacker and victim, or attacker and target. The attacker's perception, it so that decreases penalties for range. Obstacles can decrease your chance of success like if you're trying to shoot someone on the other side of a bush or a non-solid fence or something, they can be marked that way, those props are marked a certain way, anybody think of something you can see through that but partially blocks your vision.

Lighting helps every skill, good lighting helps every skill, and decreases every skill except sneak, which it does the reverse to. So bright lighting, it's harder to sneak in, it's easier to sneak when it's dark. Similarly, some creatures are marked as having night vision, so they see better when it's dimmer and they see worse when it's bright, for use of their skills. Also, the awareness of the attack can, or the use I should say, can affect the skill. For example, if you're using stealth and the person's unaware of you, that increases your chance of success. Sleeping people get a plus 30 across the board of any skill being used on them. Hey, I looked that one up and I'm like, okay.

Also, if you're using a combat skill, then if your strength is below the weapon's minimum strength requirement, penalties. If the user of the skill is blind or is crippled in either arm, that reduces the skills chance of success. For some skills like Dodge, even having crippled legs reduces your chance of success. Now there are bonuses if the target's paralyzed or stunned or prone or as I mentioned sleeping. They're very specific bonuses and penalties that are like situational dependent depending on the skill. For example, if you're sneaking and for some reason you have silence either a spell or you have move silent boots or something, you get a bonus. If you're trying to pick a lock on a container or door, those locks have penalties that apply to your skill because it's a hard lock.

Finally, if you try to use a magic item or spell on a tech target or vice versa, a tech skill or item on a magic target, that will introduce a flat chance to fail so it's independent of your skill before the game even tries your skill, it'll go I'm gonna check see if you failed because of that whole magic versus tech dichotomy in the game.

Okay, so now let's assume the role happened. What is the chance that that role is going to be a critical success? Well, it has to be a success first of all. The chance it will become critical is proportional to the skill, the better your skill, after all those penalties and bonuses I just mentioned, the better you're going to have a chance of getting a critical success. Some magic items increase the chance that their user gets a critical success, sometimes it's a magic weapon increasing your chance of getting a critical success on a hit but sometimes it can just be I'm wearing a hat, I get more critical successes with any of my skills when I wear this hat. Some situations increase the chance of a critical success, for example if you're a if you have master level training in backstabbing, I'm sorry if you have master everyone sneak and you backstab, way better chance of getting a critical success. Some status effects increase and decreased chances of critical successes. Some skills, some combat skills, I'm sorry actually all combat skills, if you do a card shot, remember that lowered your chance of actually getting a hit but that same proportion that it lowered the chance of getting hit increases the chance if you do hit, that becomes critical, that's the trade-off, the reason you try for the tricky cod shots. Fate points can just give the player an automatic critical success in whatever they picked for the fate point, and then finally, the chance of getting a critical success, can with all those adjustments I just mentioned, can drop below zero or go above 100. They drop below zero it's not gonna happen, if it goes above 100 it always happens.

Now let's compare the what I just said to the chance of getting a critical failure if you fail. So the chance of the critical failure is inversely proportional to the scale that was calculated with all the bonuses and penalties. The chance for critical failure goes up more if, if it's a CR, if you're doing an attack and the weapon is damaged. Some magic items increase the chance of critical failure, again if it's a magic weapon geez, uh it can increase the chance of your critical failure if you fail or can just be an item that you're wearing and it increases the chance of critical failure with skills. Some status effects again can up and raise and lower critical failure chance. If tech items are used by someone with a magic aptitude, so you're trying to use one of the tech weapons maybe and you, your aptitude is positive in the magic direction, you can have a critical failure with a chance proportional to the tech power of the item and your magic aptitude. Similarly, if a target critically succeeds at dodge, that can cause the attacker to critically fail their hit and that goes up with training. The player can also spend fate points to force an enemy to critically fail if an attack, if the critical failure of an attack causes a subsequent hit, for example, if on the chart you roll my critical failures, I hit myself or I hit a friend, of those hits are automatically upgraded to criticals. Critical hits on yourself or your friend, and then here's the kicker, the chance to critically fail can go over 100 meaning it will always happen, but it can never ever for any reason drop below two, unless training says you will never critically fail in a at the skill or in a particular situation because then it never even called the function to see if critical failure should happen but if a critical failure is being checked for it can never ever ever be less than two percent which means one in 50 of all failures become critical failures.

So finally, what are the effects of a critical hit, a critical success, or a critical failure? First of all, training, like I mentioned, can adjust that so you can have there are some things that can't happen if you are highly trained in a skill, some critical success, uh critical failures are ameliorated, um some critical successes

 are always forced. I'll give you an example, critical success is very skill dependent, if you heal someone and you get a critical success, you can heal more than one like crippled limb, if they're a crippled left arm and right arm, you might heal them both. If you disarm a trap and you get a critical success, you will get parts off that trap. When you're doing a critical if you have a critical success on an attack, then the effect is based on the creature you're hitting, creatures can have some creatures can't be critically have a critical success effect in a certain way, it also depends on where you hit, for example if you hit someone in the head, there's a chance you might knock them unconscious, if you hit them in the arms and legs, there's a chance they're going to that armor leg, at that chance of doing the crippling is adjusted by if they're wearing armor in that location, that armor can have an adjustment to that so some helmets are like if you wear this helmet, the chance your chance of getting knocked unconscious by any critical hit to the head is reduced. Similarly, a critical fail depends on the skill, for lock picks you can get your lock picks jammed in the lock and now only a key will unjam it, if you're pickpocketing someone and you are you critically fail, you get caught. If you're trying to heal someone and you get a critical failure, not only do you not do anything but you lose extra supplies because it takes supplies, bandages and stuff to heal someone. And then similar to critical success, if you fail with a combat skill with an attack, the failure is determined by the weapon, so some weapons can take damage or break, some weapons can hit you, some weapons can hit a friend, and if it's the range they can check rain, some weapons explode, some weapons get dropped, so it's a chart that's based on the weapon itself.

I think that's everything I dug through all the code, so that's I think a complete list of everything that can happen with critical, critical successes and failures, both inside and combat and out in Arcanum. Whoo.

https://youtu.be/GYWEgQAh6So?si=S65jmHgfuIoM3MMN

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim, and today I'm going to walk you through an Arcanum dialogue file, explains how everything works, and along the way, kind of explain why we did it this way. So, I'm going to put the file up, boom. So, this is the actual example NPC dialog file that I made back when we were making Arcanum, to show people who would want to make dialogues for the game, kind of how it worked. 

So, let me walk through how this works. The blue lines are NPC lines, and all the lines between NPC lines are PC responses. Let me tell you how those are broken down because these are very easy to write, but each column means something different. Column B is the number of the dialogue line, so if you say, you know, "Hey, I'm having an error thrown on dialogue line three," it's what's in column B, it's not the row. And this is important because later I'll explain how we ended up processing these Excel spreadsheets into plain text files. By the way, yeah, if I didn't make that clear, we wrote all of our Arcanum dialogues in Excel. We didn't have time to make a tool, so we used Excel, and then later on, we export them as dialog files.

So, column D was called the text line, the text column, and column F was called the G field. Now, in an NPC line, those often look the same because what that was, is the text field was the NPC response if the player character was male, and the G field was the NPC response if the player character was female because many languages require those lines to be translated differently, even though in English, 90% of the time, look they look the same. True, the dialogue writer could say, "How are you today, sir?" and "How are you today, ma'am?" on the different lines. Frequently they didn't; often they were just the same line, "How are you today?" So we had to include that for the localization reasons.

Then the H column was the M, the IQ field. If it was a number, it was the minimum IQ that the player needed, or the player needed to say that line. I don't believe it was used in yes, it was not used for NPCs; they could automatically say their line. Now, if the I field is negative, that means it's a maximum IQ; the player character can't exceed the absolute value of that number. So if you wrote -5, that would mean only people, only players with intelligence of five or lower could say it.

And then the J field is the test field. The test field is a test to see if the player can even say that line. Again, this was left empty on NPC lines, so NPCs could just always say their line if they got directed to by a script. But the player character, you would only see that line appear in their list of options if they matched it, if the tests in here. I'll go over in a second what the tests are; there are a lot of them.

The L column is the response line. This is if this line is selected by the player, even if it generates dialogue, which I'll talk about, it will ultimately jump to that line in the dialogue file as the next NPC response unless it was a zero. If it's a zero, that means we're done; this is an exit line. If it's negative, then it means take the absolute value of that line and jump into the associated dialogue script and run the script commands that are there. This was only done if there were too many script commands you wanted to run then would fit in the next field.

And the final field, which is the N column, which is called the result field, these the result field are script elements. They're very similar to scripts; they were just a few op codes that would be executed if it was a player line. If the player selects this line, then the result field are run. If an NPC speaks the line, then the result field is executed. Now, by speak the line, I mean actually say it in conversation because there are script commands to take these lines, whether it's a player line or an NPC line, and float it over your head like a bark or float message or something else. If it's used in that capacity, the result line is ignored. It's only if it appears in a dialogue.

So that's effectively what a dialogue line is. So let me explain how some of these work in here. I highly recommend that you watch the generated dialogue video that I made because it is, as you can see, the first three lines of this dialogue are all the player responses are generated. So let me go over what it means. Also, you notice at the end, starting at Q, I've just written things down; that's because anything past that last bracket on P was just ignored, so you could write notes over there to yourself, and that's what I'm using here.

So, line two is Bon because that's being used on a player, it stands for barter because the player's saying it. The player will ask the NPC, "Hey, I would like to buy some items. I would like to see what you have in inventory. I'd like to see what you're selling," and it opens up an entire subtree where the NPC agrees to do it, and then opens up the UI for bartering. And then when that is done, it would go to line eight, which if you look at line eight, is the NPC going, "Is there anything else?"

Line three is U: 12. UK: is asking the NPC to use a skill on your behalf. They're all numbered; skill 12 was repair. So this would generate a line saying the for the player saying, "I would like you to repair something for me." And again, that would make an entire generated subtree where you would select the item you want repaired, the NPC would tell you how much it would cost, you'd either give them money or say you want to give them money but not have enough, or refuse, whatever. That all happens in the Ukon subtree, and then when it's done, you can see that its L column is eight, so once again, the NPC, after all the stuff is done with repair, it would go, "Is there anything else?"

And then line four is the last generated dialogue, that's Kon, that stood for "ask a question." This would again open up a generated dialog tree with a variety of questions that the player could ask based on the story state of the game. And when that was done, you see that it's when it's done, it would go to line 22, which is cut off of the bottom, but then it's like, "Anything else you need to know?"

So that's that. Okay, line five, it says, "I need you to do something." Now, notice that there is a field in the test column, which is J, it says FO. FO says that the player can only say this if the NPC he's talking to is a follower, it's currently a follower. So if they are, then this line would appear and say, "I need you to do something," would jump line 15 and say, "What do

 you want me to do?" And if you look at all the results, it's "move away," the player responds, "move away," "move closer," "wait here," "disband," or "go back." All of those have something in their end column, which is their result field. If you say, "move away," it calls S: so, which is an op code for "spread out." So the NPC will literally move far away from you and maintain a farther follow distance. If you say, "move closer," it executes SC, which is "stay close," and it makes them closer in their formation. If you say, "wait here," it does WA, which makes them leave the party and stand where they're currently standing and wait for you to come back. If you say, "disband," it's LV, which makes them leave the party entirely. In fact, and if you go back to line six, you can see that the player says, "Let's go," but if you look at the J column, the test field is WA. It can, that line, "Let's go," can only be said to a follower that's in weight mode. And when you use this line, look at the result field, it's UW, which is "unweight."

So that's kind of a high-level general idea of how these things worked. Just to give you an idea, there were a huge number of test codes, not all of them could be used on both PCs and NPCs; some could be used on PCs only, some could be used on NPC's only, a lot were usable on both. I believe there were one, two, three, there were about, oo, two dozen of these test codes. There were also in the result fields, the things that could happen, there was also probably another two dozen of those. So if there wasn't a result op code for you to use, keep in mind, you could always, for the line number you jump to, give a negative number and jump to a script and do everything in a script. And you can, I have a whole video on how Arcanum scripting worked.

So, in effect, what this dialogue system let you do was generate really complex trees with NPCs where the NPC or the player, the NPC doing, saying a line, or the player picking a line, could cause effects to happen in the world, and lines could be chosen not to appear for some states that the player was in. So you could have lots of player responses, but at any given time, they couldn't show all of them.

Now, as I mentioned, we did not parse the Excel files directly, and I had three reasons for that. One, it was faster to extract this to a text file and read it from a text file, then to parse the Excel file. There's a lot of extraneous data in an Excel file, so it was slower to parse an Excel file, and back in the '90s and early 2000s, every cycle counted. Related to that, Excel files were way bigger than you would think they would be. When we extracted just this data to a text file, much, much smaller. And again, we had to load these files in order to process them, and memory was was at a premium. In fact, I believe the, now that I think about it, we had a macro in our Excel; you could just press a button, and it would write it out to a text file. Jason Anderson wrote that macro. The man had many skills.

And then the third reason that I didn't process Excel files is formats changed all the time. A new version of an Excel file would come out; I wasn't going to write new parsing functions every time Microsoft felt like updating the format of an Excel file. So writing it out to a text file meant it was faster to read, it was less memory to read, and I only had to write that import function once.

So, if you look, if you ever crack open the Arcanum dat files, you will see a lot of files with the dlg suffix. Those are plain text files, and when you look them up, you'll see something very similar to this Excel spreadsheet, but it's in plain text. By the way, the other huge advantage we had in doing this as Excel spreadsheets and keeping the row numbers separate from the dialog line number was, if you wanted to renumber the rows to make space so you could insert more player responses or you just wanted to organize your NPC lines and get NPC, like you had several NPC statements and you wanted to add an extra one in because it made sense to be with those, you could do that trivially in Excel, and it wouldn't affect any of the line numbers in B, in the B column, you because they were disassociated. They normally had nothing to do with the row, so that worked really well, and then when you wrote it out to a text file, you lost all the row numbers, but we didn't do use them for anything, so it was fine.

Anyway, this was our primitive but very powerful method of doing dialogue files in Arcanum. Whether you want to mod or make a dialogue system yourself, you know, have fun with this.

Arcanum Explaining The Void.md
Youtube Link:
https://youtu.be/rtrBgSyZAf0?si=2KNErzDAyytk-FOj

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim. Today I want to talk about the void in Arcanum, and this is something that somebody asked about. Somebody asked if I could talk about the void because it was mysterious and they wanted to know the backstory and how we came up with it and if there were any plans to use it in future games.  
   
I know that the void came up as an idea in Arcanum because it kind of filled the void of answering questions for two different things. The first one was when we made the list of magic spells, there was one that lets you speak with the dead. We originally envisioned it as how 'speak with dead' works in AD or DND version one, whatever you call that, where you could ask a set number of questions and the higher level you were, the more questions you could ask.   
  
Turns out that was really hard to get our narrative designers to the tools they would need to be able to write a dialogue that had a predetermined number of questions you can ask that varied or a variable number of questions. But we knew we wanted you to be able to speak with them and we wanted them to answer your questions because they're dead. Why wouldn't they just lie to you or just not talk?   
  
So, someone had the idea, I think it was Leonard, that they were in agony when you brought them back, they were in pain. A lot of the dialogues if you 'speak with dead' with people in the game, they're usually saying, "Why did you bring me back? This is horrible. I died." And then you ask the questions and they answer to basically limit the amount of time they're spent in that agony that you are enforcing on them with your 'speak with dead' spell.  
   
So that was one thing we knew we wanted. We knew that when people died some part of them survived. So that was the first key to the void. But we also, when we were writing the story of the game, it came up that we needed banishment. Apparently, Arronax went around banishing anyone who came up with technology. When the dwarves were discovered having given technology to the humans, they were banished. Arronax himself got banished for what he did to the Vandergraff wastes.  
   
This conjured up a different idea of the Void which is one that you could physically be pushed into. What we wanted, we talked about it for a long time, we wanted it to be the same place. We wanted it to be some extra-worldly place. It wasn't Heaven, it was more like Hades, maybe if you thought of how the Greek old Greek myths were of Hades, it was a dark physical place that while some people were physically pushed into, their entire body was there. When you died, that's where your spirit went.  
   
If you got to the end, you saw a wonderful speech given by Kurgan. Kurgan turns out to have been pretending to be Arronax throughout the game because he has Arronax trapped in the void. Remember, Arronax is there physically, so is Kurgan. Kurgan has been banished earlier. Kurgan has a plan so he's been pretending to be Arronax and when you arrive Kurgan talks about the void.  
   
Here is what he said,   
  
"If only I could show you the places I've seen, you might understand the things I say. I've been to the vessel of lands wandered by those Souls who still see the lands of the living but wear the cloak of the Dead. Lives to their own hands, they cry passing through one another like shadows in the Dying Light of Day. I've traveled to asshole's Rotten Tomatoes pierced with the jagged shots of life and vision clinging into memory regrets of the flesh. I saw that this prison was of their own making and the key was in Unknowing release and still, I traveled on. And finally, I came to the place where souls go to die or the mirrored and worn Spirits fall into an Endless Sea of gray mirrored glass. That I lowered myself within and believed there among men and I almost did not return and you know what I found they are among the silent and battered shells of the innumerable peace enlightenment truth only then that I realize that this place this life is an Abomination a horrible Distortion of a natural order this life who mother the pain and fear and envy these Twisted children who exist only because we are here to feed them to nourish them this life is afterthought a disturbance a mere Ripple in that great they've seen not even the cause but me sending these Souls upward screaming for release from the day they are torn from their Waters the effect of what I do not know nor do I care have you ever spoken with the dead holds with him from this side pull them from their silent rest do you know what it is that they feel pain when torn into this wakefulness this reminder of the chaos from which they had escaped pain of having to live there will be no more pain there will be no more chaos."  
   
That was an awesome cinematic from Arcanum, one of my favorites. Chad Moore wrote that, really good. What I love about it is, Kurgan points out the void has layers, it has levels to it, it's not just a big featureless place. He talks about how he goes through it and he sees spirits that are still trying to hold on to life and spirits that are walk around in agony and being tormented and so he finally gets that final layer that's just an ocean that the spirits just floating and they're finally at peace because they are done there, it's over. Their life is over, they accept it, they're just in an area of non-thought, non-life, you're just there.  
   
Kurgan even talks about he almost got trapped there because it was so peaceful, it was so non-painful, it was just blank but he remembered what life was like and so he came back with his plan to end life. The other reason I love that cinematic is it shows you something that I love, that whole nuanced thing I've talked about in so many videos. Kurgan does not see himself as a villain. He thought he was a good guy, he was like we've got to do something about this life that everybody is thrust into without being asked. It's painful, it's horrible, it itself is torture and then you die and you're finally released from it. Let's just speed up that process, let's just end it. The life thing was an interesting experiment, it's over.  
   
So that's Kurgan's point of view. I just love it because it doesn't make him a mustache twirling villain going, "I'm going to kill everybody." He has a reason, there's a reason he wants to do this. So the void, now obviously filled two purposes. It explained that you were pulling a spirit back from that place and back into life which was agony. It also explained that there are people there physically and on top of that it explained Kurgan's motivation. So we liked that.  
   
Now when we started doing the sequel, Journey to the Center of Arcanum, we didn't have any explicit plans to use the void although if we did introduce the legendary, the heroic level six spells, I was considering banishment as one of them. So you could just cast against something and if it didn't make its saving throw, boom, it's gone. It's kind of like disintegrate but instead of damage, they're just gone. The downside is you don't get any XP for it because you didn't kill them. But we really didn't have any plan. Of course, 'speak with dead' would still be around.  
   
I know at one point an idea was floated around of maybe there was some powerful hero that to do something in the story, you had to go into the void and convince him to come back to life and of course he didn't want to do that, he was happy being dead. All I can tell you is it was too good of an idea for us to ignore and if we didn't use it in Journey, we would have almost certainly used it in a sequel to that sequel.   
  
But that's pretty much everything I know about the void and I hope that explains and answers your question.

Arcanum Generated Dialog.md
Youtube Link:
https://youtu.be/5l7YcGCQ5Ck?si=8cYeGo23hidHY5Wi

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim. Today I want to talk about Arcanum's generated dialogue system, and I know I've been talking about Arcanum a lot, but I mean, I've got the code right in front of me, I've been going through it a lot, I've been playing with it, and the generated dialogue system is something I'm particularly proud of because it let the few designers that were on Arcanum—we had even fewer narrative designers—and it let those few people, I mean, think about, we only had 14 people tops on Arcanum, and just a few writing dialogue, they let them make so much content in the game. So, it was a good tool, but in particular, I liked it because it really doubled down on Arcanum's reactivity, and I'll talk about why when I get to the NPC one, but this could be really long. I'm probably talking really fast, but there's just so much to talk about, and it's a detailed topic for me.

Anyway, our generated dialogue system in Arcanum consisted of a number of opcodes. I called them dialog opcodes. The way they worked was in the place of what you would write where what an NPC would say or a player would say, you could write an opcode, and it was just a single letter, like A:, or B:. It always was followed by a colon, after the colon, nothing might be there, but frequently there were a lot of parameters that were optional for each opcode.

Opcodes could handle lots of different things, and I let the designers decide to turn on and off certain checks that it made or to provide parameters for things that the opcode was going to control, and I'll talk about that. What's important to remember, though, is the opcode didn't turn into a single line of dialogue; these opcodes expanded into an entire subtree, and I'll explain that in just a minute.

What was nice about opcodes is they handled all the gendered combinations, you know, a man talking to a man, female to female, male to female, female male, which matters in most languages. But I just remember things like, you know, French, if you'd say, you know, "you are pretty," it would be different depending on the gender of the person you're calling pretty.

I know we also had NPC social class, so that could factor into how some lines may have gotten translated into Japanese, which takes social standing into account and how they write things. The NPCs in Arcanum had one of 11 social classes applied to them; they could only have one, and they were, in order of top to bottom, they were Noble, priest, wizard, technologist, shopkeeper, guard, city dweller, villager, beggar, thief, and Bandit. So yes, a city dweller was more up the social standing than a villager, and a wizard was above a technologist, although there was questioning whether that was going to be switching soon.

In addition to that, opcodes could reference skills and spells, attributes. These were basically part of the parameter list you could pass into it. Okay, after that long introduction, let's jump into what they were.

The NPC's already had two opcodes that were unique to NPCs, and the first one was greeting, which I'm going to talk about last because this is by far the most complicated opcode, but the second one was money. If you added this line to an NPC, they would ask for money, and they would do it based on their social class. So, a noble person would ask for money very differently, you know, like, "Sir, I must ask, you know, coinage to exchange hands," I'm not a dialogue writer, where a beggar would be like, "Can you spare a couple of coins?"

The parameters were how much money you would ask for. If you didn't put it in, I think it defaulted to 10 coins, but you could put in how much money you're asking for, and this is a perfect example of how it expanded into an entire tree. The M, if you said, wrote M:100, that would expand into the NPC saying, you know, "Excuse me, sir, but could you spare a hundred coins," or whatever they're going to say based on their social class. A shopkeeper would be, you know, "You, I need 100 coins for that." Then the PC could respond yes or no, and if they said yes, the NPC would respond either okay, they've taken the money, and it would get subtracted, or "You don't have enough money." If you'd say no, it would bow out, and then it would go in off to those cases after getting the money, it would go to the line that that dialogue line said to go to.

The PC, on the other hand, had a zillion opcodes. I'm not going to go into detail on all of them. Let me just run down them really quick. I think they were alphabetized in code, which is really easy to go through. There was appreciate; it was basically the PC saying thank you. And you may wonder why we had opcodes for things as simple as that, and that's variety. You could write A: and be done, and you know that might be thank you, thanks, I appreciate it, that's nice of you, or whatever, and it was by class, so that would adjust. There was barter, bartering.

There was Check Story State; that was an interesting one. If the PC put in a Check Story State opcode, it would insert a line where the player would ask about something relevant to the current story state of the game. Remember I told you Arcanum had 27 story states that went through as compared to Fallout's 23, so we broke the main story into 27 distinct story states, each one of those had a set of generic things that the PC could ask about that story state to NPCs.

There was asking for directions to a location. So the up, this was an example of an opcode that required a parameter. If you asked for it, it would, the NPC would tell you how to get there but would not mark your map. There was a separate one called X for x marks the spot, which was exactly like directions but also put a mark on your map. We added that because there were narrative designers who wanted both. I should have made it a parameter, but it already had the parameter for location, and I tried to avoid extra parameters.

We had exit dialogue, which with them saying goodbye, I have to go, see ya. There was forget it, never mind, because that was a frequently used thing in PC responses, never mind, I don't care anymore, forget this, forget I asked, whatever. There was asking for healing, there was uh, asking more questions, there was the generic line of like, I have more questions I want to ask you, because that was a common one as well. There was a load a world map, where the player would say something appropriate, like, I'm gonna go look up my map now, and then would just jump the player right to load the world map for fast travel purposes from a dialogue.

There was buying a paper, there was the, oh, there was an M1,

 what is that? I think that's money as well. There was a quest one, which I'll explain more in a second. There was saying I'm sorry in various ways, there was asking for training, and you could specify what skill you were looking for training in, and that, that was put, it was the narrative designer's responsibility. If the player asks for training, the NPC off, we could look up what training they asked for, they would look up their skill and go, okay, if you asked for training in this skill, oh, I'm a master in the skill, I will offer Master training.

There was also use skill, you could ask the NPC to use a skill for you, and this is in addition to like healing or training or anything like that. There's X for x marks the spot, there was yes, which were a million ways of saying yes. There was no, a million ways of saying no, and there was also zap, which was, you specified a particular spell, and it's asking that player to cast that spell. So, you if you wanted a priest to cast resurrect or uh, speak for that, or something, you could say zap, Z: and the spell number, and it would do that.

Now, both NPCs and PCs had two opcodes that they shared. One was insult. As a PC line, it insulted the NPC based on their class, so you would say something like, you're the worst noble person I've ever met, or you're a stuck-up city dweller. For the NPC lines, it in, it insulted the NPC based on the race, so the NPC, based on their own social class, would say something to the player based on whether they're a human, half-orc, dark elf, elf, halfling. So we had this huge bank that we had fun making insults, like, what would a shopkeeper say to a dark elf they were angry at, or what would a beggar say to a half-orc? And so, we had tons of fun making those banks, and remember, every time these things pulled from a bank, so even if they just created one line, there were dozens, in some cases, multiple dozens of these lines that they could use.

And then finally, there was a rumor one that could be used for PC and NPC. As a PC, it was, it would expand to a line, basically saying, hey, have you heard any cool rumors? For NPCs, it would be offering rumors, and again, for the parameters, it could be a single number, or a set of numbers, or a range of numbers, and those were all the rumors that that NPC could offer. It would go look at any NP, any rumor that they already knew, you could, the person using opcode say, if hey, if they've already heard the rumor, don't do it, but they could override that and say, nope, if I don't care if they pay for a rumor and get something they've already heard. Rumors were based on story state, where you are in the game, and social class, so the NPCs would, a beggar would tell you a slightly different thing about there's bandits down by the river, where a noble person would go, I understand there are bandits that have set up camp and are disrupting trade.

So again, we had lots of banks for each individual rumor had banks and things that could be said. Optionally, there was an optional parameter, and I tried to avoid too many parameters like this, but rumor just took a ton, that you could add how much money that it would cost you to get the rumor, and by the way, internally, that was handled by this rumor opcode inserting an ask for money opcode dynamically in the middle of it. So I mean, the rumor opcode expanded it into an entire multi-branch dialogue tree. So this is how we saved money and got variety at the same time.

Now, I said I was going to talk about how quests and greeting work is ever complicated. Quests were really complex. Quests had seven states: unknown, mentioned, accepted, achieved, completed, completed by a different NPC, a different PC for multiplayer, and botched. Unknown was if you'd never heard it, mention was you heard it but you didn't accept it, accepted was when you accepted it, achieved is when you had done the things you were supposed to do but you hadn't turned it in yet, and then completed what you turned it in. Botched was a flag that if it was set on anything that wasn't completed, change the state to botched, but if you took the flag off, it went back to whatever state it was at, and that was because it was possible for the player to be, maybe you said you'd rescue some kidnapped person, and you got them, so now the quest was in the achieved statement thought completed, and on the way back, they get killed. If you raise them, killing, when they die, their script says botched the quest, but if you raise them, that their scripted to say okay, I'm back alive, unbox the quest, so we'll go back to achieved. So if you just accepted the quest and on the way to get them, they died, it would get botched, and going, it would look as failed in your quest log, but if you arrived and healed them or resurrected them, it would go back to accepted. So botched was done as a flag, so you could go in and out of being a botch state. Now, you can't botch a completed quest because it's already completed, so if you get the villager back home, you get the ransom money for, uh, or the money for rescuing them from the kidnappers, and then you leave, and then he dies, it's not gonna botch your quest because you've already finished that quest. Once the quest is completed, the state is permanent.

The way this worked was you would say Q: and the quest number, and it would, if it was a PC line, it would generate a line where the player asked if there are any quests available, and the NPC would answer about that quest number. If it was an NPC line, the NPC would dive right into something related to the current state. So if it was kidnapping somebody, if somebody was kidnapped, if it was unknown, they'd go, hey, someone's been kidnapped, my, you know, my, my husband's been kidnapped, I'll give you 100 coins to go find them, I think the bandits have them. If it was mentioned, the same woman might go, hey, I told you about my husband being kidnapped, are you ever gonna go look for him? If it was accepted, she'd say, hey, why aren't you out looking for my husband? You said you promised to do that. If it was achieved, she'd be like, oh, you found my husband, and set it to completed, and if it was completed, she either might say nothing, or she might go, you know, I always thank you very much for rescuing my husband.

So I love it, and if it was failed, it'd be like, oh my God, I heard my husband's dead. So you can tell how that would expand. These are interesting, is these, these dialogue

 lines, these banks were written specifically for that quest by the narrative designer, so they weren't pulled from a generic pool of lines like say ask for money or, you know, forget about it or exit, where greeting, though, was the most complicated opcode we'd ever made. It was for NPCs. The reason it was so complicated was it covered everything. This is where Arcanum generated a lot of its reactivity from because the way an NPC opened a dialogue with you is something you usually remember, and it would create greetings, it would create greetings on a huge number of tests, and these tests for the greeting could be skipped or overwritten.

If you skipped it, you NG, in general, did all the tests, and I will go over the order did it in, the narrative designer could always say, skip this test, so do test zero and one, but don't do test zero, two, and three, and then do the rest. You can also say, override it by saying, test for that one, but if it's true, don't use a generic bank greeting, I have my own override for it that I want you to say.

So let me go through what all the tests were, and keep in mind, these were also by, um, NBC social class. So I'll go through in order from test zero, because I'm a C programmer, up to uh, Tess 11, 10, or 11. Okay, so test zero was, it literally checks to see if the NPC is dead. If they are, then, because you can't talk to a dead person unless you're using speak with dead, you must be using speak with dead, so nine times out of ten, 99 times out of 100, the narrative designer will override this, but if he doesn't override it, it would say something like, I'm dead, and I know nothing, why are you, why did you rip me into pain, the pain of the living? Because remember, all the Arcanum uh, dead NPCs are in agony when you bring them back to life.

Test one, it would check for associates among the player character. This is why it was important to only have one player character, because it would go to that player character and say, who are his associates? It would check for summoned monsters, for animated dead, and for illusions. Those were three separate checks with their own banks that it could respond to. If the NPC was a wizard, he would make a sarcastic comment about your associate, like, uh, you know, I learned how to summon fire elemental when I was 15, or really, your zombies were tracking mud in here, and it would continue for everyone else. They would make a comment about how afraid they were and to exit the dialogue, which means you would have to, um, get rid of that, the that associate before you could talk to them. Keep in mind, narrative designers could override that and say, do it, do a fear comment, and then go into dialogue, so it was, you could have it both ways as a narrative designer.

Then it would test for spells that were operating on the player, and we're testing this order. It would test invisibility, body of air, body of stone, body of fire, body of water, polymorph, mirror image, and shrink. Now, you would test in that order, and each one of those spells had its own bank of comments. Again, if the MPC was a wizard, he'd make a sarcastic comment, like, could you please turn the invisibility off? Fine, I'll deal with you invisibly, or, you know, polymorph turned you into, it's like, really, you want me to deal with you as a sheep? Fine. But the wizard ones always continued; otherwise, this is what would happen for all non-wizard NPCs. If you had one of the body spells on, it would do a particular body comment and exit. If you were polymorphed into a sheep, it would comment on that and exit. If you had shrunk yourself, they would make a comment on how adorably small you were but continue. If it was mirror image, they would make a comment about how many of them, which one of you is talking to me, you know, are you twins, and continue. If it was invisibility, they'd make a fearful comment, like who said that, was that a ghost, and exit. So again, you had to add narratives on; you had to override it if that's not the behavior you wanted.

Then it would do two different tests on your armor. If you were completely naked, so just in your underwear because we were a Victorian game, the NPC would respond by their class and continue. So they were like, oh my, you know, you're down to your skivvies or something like that. If you were wearing this armor that was marked as barbarian armor, and there was a flag we could put on any armor, again, they would respond by class and continue. So a notable person might go, how uncouth, you know, where shopkeeper were like, oh, we normally don't serve your kind, and continue.

Otherwise, we got to work to like test nine or ten here; you would get greeted by the NPC based on their reaction to you. If it was a first meeting, then that was broken into a great greeting. All these were by class if they loved you, that you get a great greeting by class, friendly, a good greeting by the NBC's class, courteous again, a good greeting by NBC class, neutral, a neutral greeting by the NBC's class, suspicious, a bad greeting by the PC race, dislikes another bad greeting by the PC race, animosity, a worst greeting based on the PC's race.

If you met before, we had a different set of banks, so they could say, you know, nice to see you again, or oh, what are you doing here again? And again, it was broken down in the love, friendly, courteous, neutral in the same groups by CLA, by the embassies class, or suspicious, dislike, animosity by the PC's race. This let us do so much. You had a spell that was still running that made a visual effect; they're probably going to comment on it. You wear certain kinds of armor or you're not wearing armor at all, they're going to comment on it. You have, you know, they, they like you or don't like you, they're gonna comment on it. They, you've been there before, they're going to get a different comment. And what I loved about that was shopkeepers were often like, oh, is this your first time in the store? Would you like to see the inventory? Versus oh, it's nice to see you back. That's if they liked you. They didn't like you; it's like, oh, it's my big spender, what do you, you know, what do you want to see this time? Notice you may or may not have been a big spender; they're making fun of you because they don't like you. And of course, they'd have to do it by race, or it's like, oh, it, look, look, it's the, the half-fork that thinks that it's

, it's a person, or, you know, I wonder where you got your money from. So it was just a great way of constantly reminding you of the choices you made. I loved this, this, that's all the opcodes, by the way. That system is what led us to put together such a rich dialogue set in Arcanum because even if all the rest of it was handcrafted, that greeting allowed so much reactivity on so many different axes, and people noticed, and it was a really good way of kind of, it kind of helped people in their minds, Arcanum was just something extra special in that regard.

Never done this since. When I tried to introduce this in later games, especially at other companies, nobody was interested. I'm hoping now that AI has advanced in these LLMS, these large language model AIs, that something like this could be done but with a lot more variety, especially now that AIs can also do speech synthesis. So again, I'm hope, this is like a primitive, 20-year-old generated dialogue system. We could do a lot better today, but I thought you guys would like to hear exactly how it worked in Arcanum.

Arcanum Prototypes & Structures.md
Youtube Link:
https://youtu.be/IhaHPgZS1Fw?si=uDFIED-g-JRbtq9R

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim. Today I want to talk about prototypes and structures in Arcanum. I did the previous talk on how we did procedural generation in Arcanum, and now I want to talk about how we actually stored objects, a question several people had, and then related to the procedural generation I mentioned that buildings were done a little differently, so I'll explain that too.

So before I can explain how prototypes work, I kind of have to explain how objects work and even why we did prototypes, which was basically to save memory. Back in the late 90s, there was not a lot of RAM on PCs, and we had to conserve literally every bit. So in the game world, anything you saw on the game scene that wasn't a background tile was an object. There were 18 object types: walls, portals (portals are any kind of door), containers (which is anything that can hold an inventory), scenery, projectiles, weapons, ammo, armor, gold, food, Scrolls, Keys, key Rings, written objects that aren't Scrolls, generics, PCs, NPCs, and traps.

We grouped those 18 objects into different categories. So when I say Critter, I mean a PC or an NPC. When I say an item, I mean a weapon, ammo, armor, gold, food, Scrolls, key, key Rings, written, and the generics. And then mobiles are projectiles, containers, Critters, and items. Mobile doesn't mean it moves on its own, but mobile means that this is an object that we expect to have its location changed during the game. And then finally, there were consumables, which were food and Scrolls. Consumables are anything that when you use them, they're gone.

Now, all of those objects had fields inside of them where we stored data. Some fields were in every object; those are things like their art ID or their location or their hit points and AC. We gave every object hit points and AC in Arcanum, just in case we wanted to make an explosive that could destroy scenery or there's a spell that targeted a container, and if it wanted to damage it, we weren't sure. And, as when I explained how we did prototypes, you'll find out it was better to put them in and then have them never change than to not have them at all and then need them later.

So, some fields are very specific to an object category or group of object types. For example, for portals and containers, you might have lock difficulties and key IDs. So this is the key ID that opens this lock, and here's how hard this lock is to pick. Inventory exists inside of containers or Critters. Some fields were only in one object type. So, items are a good example of that: only items in the game had weight, had value, had a parent, which is because items can go into inventory, they can point to the parent object.

So, every object in the world pointed to a prototype. And so the way that worked was, we would make a prototype for some object, let's say we had the prototype of a knife. This would be a weapon object, and then we'd have an art ID for a basic knife, you'd have a damage range maybe one to six for the knife and what damage type it did, and how much it weighed, and how much it cost, and all those values were filled out in a knife. If you ever found a knife in the game, it would just point to the prototype and say I'm this, and then anything that was different that particular object from the prototype would then be stored on the object itself. Things like something's always restored like the location because you knew that was always going to be unique for every item. Some things were stored frequently like current hit points; that was something that it was when you first found an object, it probably didn't have current hit points, so it just inherited from the prototype, which is probably it had full health. And then as soon as it took damage, it said nope, now I have a field that overrides the prototype.

There are some things on items like charges for magic items or inventory in creatures and containers that were stored as a delta, of course, from the prototype. You don't want every container in the world to point to the same set of inventory. The reason we did that was there are then fields in, I'm sorry, bit fields in the object that says here are the of all the fields that could possibly exist in the prototype, here are the fields we're overriding. So if you had an object which was identical to its prototype, it would point to a prototype, and then its bit field bits would all be zero, which and then there would be nothing stored after it. If any of those bits were one, it meant the corresponding field was in the object, stored in order.

So that made it very very easy for us to have a lot a lot of objects in Arcanum but not take up a lot of space. If you had a hundred knives in the game, most of them only really need their location and their current hit points and their parent, so they would have three fields, and everything else, there wouldn't be anything else stored, so they'd say if you want to know about me, get it from my prototype. And we'd load all the prototypes whenever the game loaded, and then for objects, objects were stored by whatever sector they were in. So when we loaded a sector when the player entered it or got near, the sector because we didn't want the there to be a delay if the player walked too close to another sector, so we pre-loaded sectors as you walked around, these objects would get loaded in, but they were very small. And what was great about that is you only loaded this very small object, you didn't really have the data, it's just whenever anyone asked for it, if somebody said hey I need to know this I this knife's hit points, you go here's the bit field for hit points, it's a zero, so give the prototype's hit points, or it's a one, and it's the third one we saw, so go to the Third Field in the object, and that will be its current hit points. This worked really well. Mark Harrison, one of the programmers, did the majority of the heavy lifting on this. Objects like this not only meant we had less we used less Ram in Arcanum, but our save games were smaller too.

I do know that when people try to mod the game, they were a little aggravated because the way objects and prototypes were interrelated made it hard to understand, but wow did it help us when we were making the game. And then the other thing I want to talk about with procedural generation, I often talked about buildings and structures worked differently than almost any other object that was in the world, and the reason for that was the way you made buildings or structures, um, because I'll talk about like Dungeons and caves were also structures, they were made usually in top down views. Let me explain how that worked.

The game is normally isometric. You for any structure you wanted to make, there was a floor, wall, ceiling grouping, meaning the artist would say here are the floors that go into the structure, here's the basic wall type. Now there are lots of wall subtypes, there are corners and where a window would

 go, there's the left part, there's the center part, and there's the right part. I'll explain that in a second, and then there's a ceiling that would be stored for a dungeon or cave, you wouldn't have a ceiling because you want to see all of it.

The way you would draw one of these is you'd switch to top down mode, which would still do the we still have the same numbers for all the tiles, but they were literally not at a 45 degree angle, they were done top down, and then you just draw a rectangle, and that's the house. If you drew another rectangle, it would merge them. The perimeter of all of these rectangle or merged rectangles were the outer walls, and we would know what you know do an outer corner or an inner Corner because those are the different Corner types, and then walls along the perimeters. If you had a rectangle drawn and it already had all the walls around it and you drew another rectangle that intersected it, we would remove all those walls of in the intersection and just do the ones along the perimeter. This did mean that if you wanted to add a interior wall later, you had to go in and do it by hand, but those were easy to do and didn't take much time.

The if you wanted to add a door or window, what you did is you go back to isometric View, and now you can see your house, and you would click either on the door or the window, and then you click on the wall, and it would add a door there or window. And for Windows, it put a window where you clicked and then put the right closing part of it in the left closing part in the wall segments on either side, so you couldn't put a window in a corner, which was good, couldn't put a door in a corner. If you put then another window next to it, it just extended it, so you had a longer window, so window, window, and then the bracket parts, and you could do that all along all the way up to a corner. Doors were similar, you could put down a door, if you put a door next to it, you're not a double door, if you put down a third one, it would check to see if there was a triple door, if there wasn't, it just didn't put anything, so if you made a double door and you tried to make it a triple door, you may not be able to, but you could always go replace this with a wall and then click over here, and now your double door is here instead of here.

This worked really well, it let us make buildings super fast. We laid out to rant really quickly, but what's really good is because dungeons work the same way, when you made a dungeon map, you just made the entire background the solid rock background we had, which I think was a bluish squiggly thing, and then you would just draw in like here's a hallway, I would put in the walls, here's a room, it would delete the wall segment at the end, put in the perimeter of that room, and the connector would be empty, or that you could just walk right in, and then you could go back to ISO and put a door there. So this worked really well because we could make dungeons very quickly. Remember, there were only like a dozen people on our Canon, so this was super important.

This let us make any kind of structure, a ruin, a building, a dungeon, really really quickly. The anks work the same way. This let us put it together really quickly with one person doing a lot of these things. I think all the artists eventually made levels, but one person could make an entire dungeon level really quickly. Then you just went in when you were back in isometric and you put the doors and then the interior walls you wanted, then you'd place the props, you'd you know Place bookcases and tables and chairs. So this made the levels quick, quick to add, and because everything you were putting down were objects that had prototypes, if you put down a table and a bunch of chairs, nothing had to be stored other than this is the location, this is in, that there was a table out there, a prototype table that stored all the important stuff you need to know about how the art ID and everything about that table.

This worked really well, especially for because you did the floor, and our footsteps depended on the floor texture, it was very easy to change your footsteps and walked into a structure because you knew you were within the bounds of the structure and you knew what the floor was, and the floor had like is it wood, is it stone, is it metal, and you could get the corresponding footstep out of that. Structures also overrode the lighting, so if you were outside and you went into a structure, you were now inside, and it knew also not to do the lighting using the outdoor lighting, it would use whatever the structure had as lights inside of it. This worked really well for us.

I know people who tried to mod Arcanum later were a little frustrated, but both objects and their prototypes and structures were designed to minimize memory and make it possible for a dozen people to make the zillions of maps that we had in Arcanum. So I hope this you know tickled your interest and brought to light some of the things that we did in Arcanum that was kind of cool.

Arcanum Random Encounters.md
Youtube Link:
https://youtu.be/-sB_AnqAG5w?si=2NEt3AeVUEFdn3_k

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim. Today, I want to talk about Arcanum's Random Encounters. This is not a follow-up but a parallel to the video I did on Fallout Random Encounters. A few people asked me how Arcanum worked and how different it was, and how we handled certain special Random Encounters that happened at a particular time of the game. I would admit that when these questions came in, all I could remember is it had something to do with Arcanum's timed event system. We had a really complicated timed event system which is basically a queue of events that any system in the game could throw things into, and they could be either real-time which is based on the actual time going on or it could be game time. In fact, there was a second timer called game time two; one of those was affected by pauses in the game, and the other one wasn't.

So, I went in there and I did find the link to Random Encounters which oddly enough weren't in their own module; they were tacked into a UI module. So, bad design on my part, but I did find out exactly how they worked, and I will go through that now. So Arcanum's Random Encounters were set to occur between 300 and 700 game minutes which works out to between every five hours and 11.6 hours. It would check for one, and it didn't guarantee one would happen, but that's what it would check. That's how often it would check, and then whether the checker or not was successful, it would reset the next timer for another 5 to 11.6 hours, which means in a 12-hour period you might have two encounters because they both did it at five or six hours, or you might only have one.

So, the Random Encounters were only allowed if you were currently on the world map, not the UI, but you were out on a sector that was part of the world map. Basically, they were specifically disallowed in any place that had a town map. So, think of it as if you were standing in a sector, and if you hit the town map button, if a town map came up, you could not have a random encounter there. If it didn't come up, then you were good to go. Now, I said this is it whether or not you were in the world map UI, a random encounter could happen whether you were fast traveling via the world map, and remember this time sped up when you did that, and this is all based on game time, or whether you're walking those sectors manually, which you could do. You could walk between any two points on the world map and travel through every sector in between. They would also happen if you're just standing there because it only paid attention to the passage of game time.

Interestingly, there was in the encounters, and I'll talk about that in a second, there was a frequency which is what's the chance of this happening and would just drop down that list of creatures, checking the frequency until one triggered, meaning if designers wanted something to happen more often, they moved it near the top of the list and they increased its frequency. The frequency was automatically increased if you were sleeping, meaning as it went down that list, all the frequencies are in there were automatically adjusted upward if you were asleep, so something that might not have encountered you or come at you when you were awake would do so if you were asleep. This was partially realism, partially funism, and partially the hand of the designer basically telling the player you should probably sleep in an inn or building or even a dungeon, but if you're going to sleep out in the wild, good luck to you.

The checks were done based on your exact location, so that was sector and tile, you know, every location in the game had a very unique number that specified it. There were default encounter charts that we made that were based on the terrain of the sector you were on that stab base terrain, and also time of day, so like a light forest during the day would have a different encounter chart than a light forest at night. Same thing for desert, for coastal, for plains, for grasslands, stuff like that. So, they're all different default encounters. Those encounters also had what were called a power setting, which was set by the designer to say basically is this an easy encounter, an average encounter, or a powerful encounter, and then they had the frequencies I mentioned which is what was checked against, what was literally like rolled against to see if that encounter triggered.

Now, the designer had access to a variety of overrides, and what that meant was the designer could put a point with a radius and say if an encounter happened within this point in radius, here's a default table to use instead. People would use this for things like they'd make ruins, and it didn't really have a town map, it was just some ruins that you stumble cross, but they wanted that place to be if you pass through it, you're more likely to encounter like skeletons or zombies, so you would put a point on the ruin, put a small radius on it, point it to a table that was full of undead.

Now, there's always a chance that you might be in multiple circles, two circles may overlap. The way that was done is if you appeared in multiple circles, the smaller radius circle always took precedence. The idea being it was smaller, it was more concentrated or whatever than something that was bigger. If by chance there were two circles that overlapped that were the same radius, it would break ties by the distance, and if that was exactly the same, it would just whichever one was was detected first. I don't think that I don't think the second tiebreaker ever got triggered by any of the designs we put together.

Now, the encounter chart, it specified the creatures and how many numbers, so you could have one set of creatures, you could have a mixed set of creatures and how many of those should be created, it was random. When they were created, they were spawned in a certain distance from the player, then equipment was created on them or loot, it would specify like if it was people, if it was bandits, they would like okay they get this armor and this weapon and it's wielded. If it were just creatures, they would have loot. I believe they could even spawn in a loot container, but I'm not sure about that. They were also arranged into formation, there was a functioning you could call that would scatter them because we picked a point away from the player, but we didn't want them all standing on each other, so they would spread out into a formation.

Interestingly, and I forgot about this, and this is why I always like to go back to the code, these encounters tracked how many times they were triggered. We did this because remember I put script overrides on everything, so that was true for hey an encounter just triggered if you want to run a script that way designers could say hey I only want this particular encounter to happen so many times, so what would happen is that script would call, they would check against some max, and then they might delete that override, so once you encountered so many special encounters in this area, it could delete itself. Or they may just want that information, maybe they want to say every time you encounter this there's an extra creature, or when it passes a certain

 threshold of how many times it's encountered a boss creature appears in it, you got all this kind of control over what you wanted to do.

Now, somebody else when they asked about Random Encounters specifically said well how did you handle special things like the Milwaukee in hand showing up, you know by the way spoiler warning for a 20-year-old game. The way that worked was I already talked that there were encounter overrides which worked on specific areas of the game, well in addition to those because this whole thing worked through the timed event system, a quest or a story state could add in timed events, so you could have a timed event that only happened when a certain quest had been completed, or while you were on a certain quest, or when the game was in a particular story state. Remember, there were 27 story states in Arcanum so we had pretty specifically defined where you were in this non-linear storyline which of the major events because remember I said it was like a football, there were there were certain points you had to pass through but how you got there was up to you. Those 27 points were defined, and at any time the script could ask where they were, where the player was in that story. These were used for things like when you got far enough along in the game and you had triggered the milk in hand I'd be chasing you down for the assassin guys, they would just show up, and when they did they would show up, they would act like a random encounter, and they would go and they'd tell the random encounter system push your time out a certain amount because they weren't created by the random encounter system, but what I didn't want to happen have happened was you had a random encounter from one of these quest or story states, and then a minute later you had a real random encounter, so whenever one of they have those happened, it pushed out the random encounter timer a few more hours.

I did find a couple comments of of code that hadn't been done. I'll give you an example of one of them that I understood. There was a a check that was commented out and there was a programmer name next to it saying didn't have time to do this which said if a random encounter was called for in a sector that already had creatures spawned on it, the random encounter was delayed basically it before it was even rolled it was just saying you know what push a grammar counter out a bit, uh the check to do around kind of outer bit because what we didn't want to do is you enter a sector which has full of skeletons or maybe you know some other kind of monsters and boom we throw a random encounter in on it. Now personally, I would think that would be cool if that would happen because they may not befriend each other, so you may have one of those encounters that you show up in and they're fighting each other. Don't know if anyone ever saw that, I never saw that just because the chance of you being in an occupied sector that didn't have a town map that had creatures that you hadn't already killed, and a random encounter triggered at just that moment was very small, but I'd love it if anyone ever saw that.

And then one last thing I want to mention is Random Encounters in Arcanum are not equal to monster generators. Monster generators are a totally different thing. They were basically an object that you could place in the world that inside of it had a data structure very similar to a random encounter which was here's a list of creatures, here's what they're they wield or have as loot, and here's a timer, but the way monster generators worked is they were placed in a particular location, and then that location was a monster spawner. So, it would get called periodically based on its own timer, and it would check, and you could have a script override, I had to go I want to check time of day, I want to check to see if the players in a particular quest date, I want to make sure this hasn't happened so many times, you can check all that, and then if it if it passed all the checks, it would create a creature or a set of creatures. We use this in a variety of places in the game both out in the world and in dungeons basically to have an endless supply of monsters until the player did something that would then meet a condition for the monster spawner to stop spawning.

I think that's all the ways that creatures can be randomly generated in Arcanum that aren't being of course summoned by a creature that of the monster something's about. I hope it was fun to hear about this and contrast it to how we did Random Encounters which were a totally different system in Fallout, and I'll provide a link to that video below.

Arcanum Scripting.md
Youtube Link:
https://youtu.be/coPkWyJIl-M?si=t_xF5PNSOvrXv4yk

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim. Today, I want to talk about scripting in Arcanum. Now, I was going to compare and contrast it with Fallout scripting, but Fallout script came directly from Starfleet Academy. I never used it. I wasn't the one who integrated it in, so while I know what it was like, I don't really have any use in it, and so I'm gonna defer that for now.

Let me talk about Arcanum's scripting. One of the issues when we started Arcanum was we didn't have the budget to hire any scripters, and the programmers already had so much on their plate that there was really no way that they were going to do all the scripting as well as all the coding. So, I set out to make a script editor for a script language that anybody could use, not just coders. I wanted to make it simple, intuitive, and something that would help prevent a lot of the common errors I saw in Fallout, which were things like scripts with syntax errors in them or infinite loops. So, I tried to do that. I wrote an editor called Sock Monkey. I tried to take a video of a Windows video of it, but none of the pop-ups that happen within Sock Monkey will record, so I'm just going to talk about it.

So, every script in Arcanum had its own flags, and these are things that we wanted to be able to test without actually looking into the script. There were things like "this is a trap script", so that way if any object in the scene had a trap script on it, that's what detect traps would highlight, and it also meant that entering, using that object in any way, is what triggered the trap. The script could also have flags like "you only run me once and then you delete me". It could also have something called a Teleport trigger, and what that was used for is normally, you could only put scripts on a tile so when it got entered, but if you teleported across an area, it would not trigger the teleport trigger said if someone teleports from one area to another in a direct line, then if any of the scripts on that direct line have T trigger on it, run them anyway.

So, every script had its own local counters and flags that were preserved between script execution. It could access global arrays of variables and flags and also could look at any data that was kept on the player. So, every line in Sock Monkey was either a conditional or an action. It was either an if-then or an action, but secretly they were all if-thens. If you told it you wanted an action, it just internally wrote "If true, then do this; else, do nothing", because it would just always run the then, and it would display it as an action. You thought it was an action, but internally everything was just a conditional.

So, the way these things worked is when you selected whether it was an action or condition, let's say you did a condition, you could then select conditions from a drop-down menu. These would be things like "OB has item" or "OB is within N tiles of OBGE", and I'll explain the parameters in a second. Actions would be again selected from a drop-down; those could be things like "set global N" or "print message N" or "have OBGE cast spell on OBGE".

Now, those parameters I've been mentioning, those were also selected with a drop-down. If you had a number, it would just have you type in a number, or you could say get the number from this local or global variable, then it would look it up on the appropriate list. So, there was a message list, so if you said "print message N", you would look it up on the message list. If you said "they have item N", it would look up; there could be a list of items you could make, and it would look up the Nth one. For spells, there was a spell list. There were lots of lists that were already available in the game, and those were there for a lot of reasons, but the script system could use them as well.

What was cool about OBs, though, was we had a lot of predefined objects like player was an OB, so you could select player for the OB. You could select trigger, which was who activated this script. So if you opened a door, you were the trigger. You could also say attache, so if you open the door, the attache is the door 'cause it's the one that has the script on it. I also had a concept of "every" and "any", so you could say like "every follower", "any follower", "everyone on team", which would include the player and all the followers, or "anyone in party", which in multiplayer would be all the players.

What was cool about that was "every" and "any" were great for conditionals. You could say, let's say there's a door, and you can open it; it's locked, but if anybody has the key, it can open. You could put on the door's open attachment, I'll talk about attachments in a second, you could say if anyone in the party has key five, then return to default, which is the door can be open; otherwise, return, and it would skip it. And I'll talk about that in a second too.

What was cool about "every" and "any" was not only is it great for conditionals, you could say, you could also make a door that required everyone to have like a hat on, or the door wouldn't open. You could say everyone in the party had item, and it's the hat. But you can also use "every" in the loops. You could say for everyone in party, and then you could, inside that loop, there's a special object called "loop object", so it would loop through everyone, and you could run some actions that would happen on everyone in the party. Or if you wanted to test something on everyone in the party, you could say for everyone in the party and then check for things on them.

Originally, this, we didn't have a go-to. However, scripts had to be able to call other scripts, and I soon discovered that because I was called on to bug it that people would have script A call script B, and then call script A, and a loop would happen that way. So, I put in go-tos to let you jump around in your inside one script, but I had to put on uh fail-safes in the script system so if it ever tried to run, I think it was more than a thousand lines, it would just tap out and go, "I've executed a thousand lines of scripts. I don't think this thing is ending." And I never thought those would trigger; they triggered.

Uh, I mentioned two return values. This was important because there were lots of different different ways to attach a script, and I'll talk about that in a second, but if a script returned, just said "return", that meant it would return and run whatever the default was supposed to happen for that attachment point. Um, I'm sorry, I have that backwards. If it said "returned to default", it would run and do the default stuff. If it said "return

", then that means go back to whatever called me and don't do the default action. That's the script's way of saying, "I handled it." So, if you had a door and on its open attachment point you put "return", well, the default is that you can open the door. So, if you pass back "return", the door would not be open, and it would just print a message saying you can't open the door. The "return to default" would allow you to open the door. Same thing on a container, same thing on; you could put it on anything, anyone's use.

So, let's talk about attachment points. There was a big list of places you could attach scripts. You could attach it on the use of it, you could attach it on um an item being picked up, you could attach it on an item being wielded, you know, so like you pick up a sword, it goes to your inventory, you wield it, now you're holding on selling it to someone. Um, so I'll give you an example of how that would work. Let's say you had an attachment point on a merchant for "buy object", and let's say what that actually says is it def; it defaults to the NPC who's the attache buying an item, which is the trigger. If the, if it says "return", if that, it; he won't buy it. His default is to buy it. So, let's say you wanted to make a special object that no merchant would buy because for your quest, you wanted to make it so that it couldn't be sold to a merchant or only one merchant would ever be interested in buying it. You could put scripts on your merchants saying if you try to, if on their attempt to buy this object, it would just "return", so they wouldn't buy it.

Similarly, you could have there's a wield on script attachment point, so every time somebody tries to wield it, that script gets caught. You could say if the creature um who's trying to wield it, if you do "return", that means he can't wield it, so it won't go on. You could maybe make a sword that you can only wield if your magic score is above 90, let's say. So, it's a sword that can only be wielded by super magical people. In Arcanum, you could check to see if the person trying to wield it had a magic skill of 90, and if they didn't, you "return"; if they did, you "return to default" because the default of wield is put it on you, is let let you wield it.

Similarly, for "wield off", you could test things like you could make a cursed item and say this item cannot be removed. It could, so a cursed item would just get a script saying "return" because "return to the fault" would let you remove it, so "return" would not let you remove it. Then, if the only way to take it off was to finish a quest, the quest would take the, the quest script would take it off. If there was a spell that could do it, you could put a script saying when that spell was cast on it, you can remove the, the object can be removed.

So, this is how we did a ton of things in Arcanum because the, we would agree what the default would be in the code, and I would code it that way, and then in the few places that a person making a quest or an item would want it to behave differently, he put attachments on. So, that was really cool because it let us have a lot of power. It let non-script make a lot of scripts, and it let us do a lot, remember, with only 14 people.

So, I'm pretty sure Sock Monkey went out because it was part of like World editor and, and um other things that we shipped to try to make the game modable. I think it was a success because we had a lot of people on the team make scripts, including artists and um some folks who had no previous experience doing code. So, I think it was pretty successful. It also, because of the, the nature of how it wrote out the data, it was executable really fast, so scripts were not a huge drain. And Arcanum, of course, was using every last CPU cycle it could get, so I'd say Sock Monkey was a pretty good success for us in Arcanum.

Um, I wish I could show a video of it doing anything but sitting there because all the pop-ups refused to show, but I'll figure it out. Anyway, I hope this answers some questions and gives you some insight into how we did scripting in Arcanum.

Arcanum Tech Skills & Schematics.md
Youtube Link:
https://youtu.be/kC7StCQZW7Y?si=ZUMQtP4abGNoFQ3b

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim. Today, I want to talk about Arcanum Tech skills and schematics, and the reason I want to talk about that is I've had enough videos where I've talked about designs changing, other people having better design ideas than me, the whole process of doing a game from start to finish with pillars, design pillars, and so many other considerations. The reason I want to talk about Arcanum Tech skills is I want to talk about something you probably haven't heard about, which is they started completely differently than how they ended up.

I was going through my Troika file archive, which is really big, and I found the original master design doc for Arcanum that was written in late '98, early '99. And I found that originally, there were a lot more Tech skills than what we planned. So, let me walk you through what happened.

Originally, skills were divided into basic skills and Tech skills, and the basic skills were a lot like what we already had, with the exception of there was no technological skill category. Instead, technological skills were in their own grouping. They were all governed by INT. They worked very similarly to basic skills except why they were limited by INT, they didn't start at INT, it didn't add anything to them, so you had to buy them as you went along. They were broken into four categories: Smithy, Mechanical, Chemical, and Advanced Tech.

Each one had skills in those categories. The Smithy category only had one skill, repair, that was for fixing things like swords and shields and armor. The mechanical category had five skills: it had shoot guns, pick locks, arm and disarm traps, repair mechanical, and combine mechanical, and what that lets you do was, as expected, it controlled simple Tech like guns that use bullets, repairing that kind of item when it got damaged, and also combining them so you could add scopes to guns or somehow combine two guns to get a different gun. That was sort of like schematics, but it was very less defined than that.

The chemical category was create heal powder, create bullet, and that you had a lot of different types: create Dynamite, create Fuel, and create battery. So, the chemical one was interesting because it was all, "Here's the exact thing that it creates." It was very much like the schematics we ended up with. And then the advanced technology skills had shoot Advanced Tech weapon, repair Advanced Tech weapon, and combine Advanced Tech weapon, very similar to the mechanical skill, but this was for all the advanced Arcanum weaponry like stun guns or flamethrowers, anything that didn't shoot a bullet.

These never got implemented. This was part of the original design pass I did, but Jason Anderson really liked the tech side of things, and he didn't really like these skills. So, he put together a new system, which is the one we shipped with, where four of the skills that I mentioned got moved into the regular skill system in their own technology category. So, remember, there was combat, thieving, and social; we added a technological and put repair, Firearms, pick lock, and arm disarm trap in there.

Then Jason came up with the idea of making a whole bunch of schematics and putting them into particular categories, which he called Tech disciplines. We had eight of those, and those were Smithy, which was the armor, melee weapons, armor, Shields; mechanical, which were any gadgets that worked purely mechanically; gunsmithy, which was all the weapons; electrical, which was anything with charges and magnetism; herbology, which is sort of the, we originally called it anatomical, um, it was the body and any substances that would affect it; Therapeutics, which were man-made materials affecting the body, the herbology was natural materials; chemistry, which were man-made substances that were deleterious; and explosives, which was new and unstable substances.

So, the way those worked is each one of those disciplines had seven degrees that ranged from novice to doctor, and whenever you spent a point in it, you advanced in a degree, and you also got a schematic. Now, these schematics were what we called the Learned schematics, and he added a bunch of ideas for beyond the Learned ones. The idea was sort of like the Learned ones were the ones you were guaranteed to have because you spent a point in it. It was automatically granted. It's a thing you learned how to make when you advanced your degree.

Then there were two other categories though of schematics, the found schematics and the purchased schematics. The found schematics were schematics that could be in any one of those disciplines that we would drop in the world for loot, so they could be in a chest, they could be carried by somebody, basically there were things you found when you were out and exploring. And then we had the purchase schematics, which we would actually put in shopkeeper inventories around the world. So you might be in a herbologist shop, and she might have a couple of herbologist schematics for sale.

And what's interesting is, no matter where you got these, how you got them, once you knew them, they all worked the same way, which was it that it had two ingredients that you had to find, and then the schematic told you how to combine them to get the third thing, which was the result. So, what I loved about this, Jason designed all of this. What I loved about it was it put the skill ones back into the skill tree we already had. It took the things that built stuff and actually made an entirely new system out of it, the schematics. And what I loved about it, as the programmer, is they all, all every schematic worked the exact same way. Here are two things that combine to become this third thing. So, it's very easy to make the schematics, data-wise, to make an inventory, to figure out how they would pull things from inventory, to make a UI for them. It was basically a very clean, wonderful design, and that's what we shipped with.

What made me think about doing this video, though, was in early 2017, this was well into the development of the Outer Worlds, but the Outer Worlds had me thinking of crafting and how that would work again, and I was reminded of Arcanum and how much I really, really loved this system. And so, I ended up going through the files I had for Arcanum. Okay, I've got everything, and while I don't have a lot of the models, those are on a DAT tape somewhere, a DAT tape that I don't own, I did have a lot of the 2D art. And so, I ended up—it's not very big—but ended up printing a book, which I love: Arcanum Technological Schematics.

And what I just thought was funny, and this is just how my brain works, is I divided them. Here are the schematics that you learn by discipline. So, I would print out the chemistry schematics. Then I had, well, here are the gunsmithy schematics. I really loved the art on this. It was so good, so good. I love how just everything looked like it was on a Papyrus or old, you know, paper, and it just was really cool. But what I did for this book

 is that I had a section on the found schematics, which I broke down by where you found them. So here are all the ones you find in Ashbury, you know, here are all the ones you found in the Black Mountain Clan mines, here are the ones that has to be—yeah, here are the ones you find in the Brenda Groth ruins, which are, you know, really crazy stuff, you know, like the war gauntlets and bizarre guns.

And then if you keep going, I have a whole section on the purchase schematics, and I have those broken down by, um, I think it was what type of store would have this. So there's armories, there were gun shops, in the explosive section, there were gun shops in the gun section, and herbalists, like I said, you might go into an herbalist shop, and there's the fortifier. What I loved about it is they were the art was broken down by how we plan to use it in the game. So here are the schematics you find by location, or here are the purchase schematics you find by shop type. It was just when we did things like that, it tickled the programmer part of my designer brain, but it also meant when I went to go put this book together, it was very easy to do so. So, it's something I love that I own. It's something very unique. I kind of wish I'd made a bigger one. And when I when I selected it online, I thought I was selecting a slightly larger size.

The other reason I want to do this video is this is a perfect example of there was a design I put together, but then someone else had a much better idea, so that was what got implemented, and that was what got put in the game. So, what you saw and played and enjoyed in Arcanum was Jason Anderson's design, and I think it was a much better design than what I originally put together. I just, I like explaining that stuff because I know I talk a lot about these things, and people tend to attribute a lot to me that I didn't do, and I like to make sure that everybody understands who did what. And I say this a lot: like, I almost never wrote dialogue except in Temple. So if you love all the dialogues in Arcanum, those were a lot of other people: those were Leonard and Jason and Sharon and Chad Moore. There were just, there were so many dialogues that were written by other people. So, I just hope you like the game, and I really hope you like the tech schematics. I like them so much I got a book on them.

Arcanum's Procedural Terrain Generation.md
Youtube Link:
https://youtu.be/BbI7hFoT6TQ?si=p2RHCunLdZ4fqGuR

Hi everyone, it's me Tim. Today I wanted to talk about Arcanum's procedural terrain generation system. I've gotten some questions about this for years. The fact that we did this in the late 90s, I thought was pretty cool. It also was pretty required because there was no way, no way we could store as much map, especially Overland map, as we wanted in the computers of the time. We just didn't have the memory. So basically, the procedural generation was a way for us to generate maps and treat what we edited as Deltas to those Maps, and I will explain all this, but I went through the code to make sure I was accurate. I've got to start at the very bottom. This is going to get technical. I'm not going to go into code itself, but it does get a little technical.

So, a tile in Arcanum, especially if you use the world editor, you know this, it's a diamond. It is 80 pixels by 40 pixels. We estimated a tile to be approximately five feet, um, you know, if because it's a square, if it's viewed top down. So that means that those are about a thousand tiles per mile. Now tiles could only connect in their diamond shape, they could only connect to certain other tiles. They did this based on the four, um, not just the four edges, but they also, they treated each we looked at each point of it because it connected at that point to three other tiles, and there were only certain transitions that were possible. So, for example, if we had a lot of tiles, we had deep water, shallow water, um, Coastal, so it's a mixture of water and sand, sand, scrub, grass, light Forest, Deep Forest, Rocky, hilly, Mountain. So, we had a lot of terrain. Towers could only connect to certain other terrain, there was a basically it was marked each of the four corners that were marked as having transition tiles, tiles they were allowed to have adjoining to them which meant, so say grassland could only connect to sand, which could only connect to Coast. I mean, grass could also connect to light forest and Scrub, but if you dropped deep water, the only thing that could be around the deep water would be shallow water, and then around that shallow water you could do deep water again, but you could also have Coast which could then transition to sand. So, if you ever dropped let's say, you had a map of nothing but grass and you dropped deep water in the middle of it, you'd see it go deep water, shallow water, Coast, Sand, Grass.

The tile types were also used to control player movement. They were marked with whether the player could walk across them, over there they were blocked, whether they could fly across them, or whether that was also blocked. They whether they would sink in it, so we would draw them up to their knees, or whether they it was icy, so that's when they would slip and fall. Tiles also controlled sound. So, the sound your footsteps made as you walked across it, we had six different sound types: we had walking on dirt, sand, snow, Stone, water, and wood. That covered everything we needed, including inside structures.

Now, to save on Art, because we are to save on space, and I guess art, we had to create some of the tiles could be flipped horizontally. That was only possible if it looked fine when it was flipped, and we knew the transitions would work even if the art was done flippable. The artists worked really hard to make sure that was the case as frequently as possible, so we could store less tiles. You also got more variety because if you could take a tile and flip it, it looked a little different, and as long as it's so connected correctly, you got more variety.

Okay, so those were titles. The next level up, receptors, sectors were an array of 64 by 64 tiles, meaning they were 5120 pixels by 2560 pixels or about 320 by 200 feet, which is easy to remember if you knew VGA was 320 by 200 pixels. If so, if one of those pixels with a foot, a sector is a VGA screen. Each one of those sectors was uniquely numbered based on its XY location in the world map, which I'll get to explain in a second how big that was. The fact that sectors were unique, uniquely numbered is important, so just remember that every sector, you could say sector 5102, and boom, that was a unique sector on whatever map is loaded.

Now, at the map level, which is a bunch of sectors, we had a base terrain at that level. We supported up to 32 base terrains. There were things like grass, Forest, Mountain, Water. We didn't have to specify deeper shallow, we didn't have to specify light or heavy force, it was just very basic types like that. What the That Base terrain was used for was Auto generation, which I'll talk about in a bit. We could Auto generate sectors, and also whether a player could move through that sector on the world map, the things like water and mountains were marked impassable. So when we were moving you along the world map, it tried to move you straight there, and it would move you along around mountains and water where needed.

Now, a map in the game, which we called the world, but really it specifically was a map, it defaulted to 64 by 64 sectors, defaulted, I'll get to that in a second. A map defined for itself whether it was indoor, outdoor, for purposes of things like lighting. Outdoor Maps, you know, got day-night lighting, some backgrounds cared about whether you were indoors or Outdoors, in addition to whether it being day or night. We also passed that information to audio, so if they wanted to make different sounds like audio ambient sounds at night, could be different than daytime for the map, they could do that. Now, structures would override that. If you were an indoor map, you're always indoors, but if you're an outdoor map, if you went into a structure, that would override it, and you'd be indoors. Structures were made differently than a lot of other things. We had a top-down way of doing structures as rectangles. It's too long to go into it here, so just know that structures exist. Structures are basically buildings, but basically anything that we wanted to call a structure, we could make a structure ability for basically it's rectangular things put in the world that you could go inside of.

Now, the Arcanum world map was 2000 by 2000 sectors, mostly fought up at that Central continent. That meant that Arcanum was 128 square miles, 128 miles on the side. That is a large world for late 90s, and remember, you could just walk through this anywhere you wanted to go. However, our world map's maximum size was 67 million sectors Square, precisely 67 million 108,864. That translates to 4.2 billion tiles, hint unsigned to Max int, or about 4.2 Million Miles Square. So in theory, with the Arcanum World editor, you could make a map that was 4.2 million miles on a side. That's a big map. We

 never made a map that big.

Now, Maps were created in the world editor that we shipped with the game. We created it with the same world editor the game Kim at the game. You basically would create a map. Now, the way we would, uh, treat like when you when you created the map, you would paint sectors down on it. You would paint one of the base terrains. You could say let's say you're making a Content, you can like here's a bunch of grass, then here's them out in range, and then here's some water that goes down, and there's ocean all around it. Those were painting at the sector level. If you ever wanted to go into a sector, it would be procedurally generated based on its sector number, which is its location, Modified by any differences. And before I say that, because we had multiple people working, the way our world editor worked at Troika was whenever anyone edited a sector, it would lock it by using its sector number. It would write it sector number as a file into a directory, a network directory. If that file already existed, that meant somebody else had already locked it. Once you save the sector, it would save it, confirm that the data had saved correctly, and then remove that file lock. This was basically we knew how to do it back then because file creation is atomic. So if two people tried to lock it at the same time, one would create the file, and the other would get file already exists. So basically, creating a file was an atomic operation, and the name of the file, which is the sector number, we knew was unique. So anyway, you would create if you went into a world at a World editor into a particular sector to modify it, we would just remember the differences. So let's say you opened it up, it would procedurally generate it. It would take the base Terrain, and I had algorithms for all the different base frames of how to create the tiles within it. So let's say it was a grassy area, it would put down a couple plants, maybe a tree here and there, Boulders, flowers, whatever. It did that by seeding a random number generator with that sector's unique sector number, so that random number generator would always generate the same random props to put onto the map. This meant that every time you loaded that sector, no matter what machine you were on, whether you would ever load it before, you would always see those props in the same locations, the same props in the same locations. Then when you, if you decided to edit that sector, let's say you changed some tiles, let's say you, you know, deleted one of those trees or put another tree over here, it would remember those Deltas as changes, ads, and removals, and store that as the sector's data, which meant if you only made three changes that sector would get only stored with three Deltas. So that it was a very efficient way of storing a sector. When anybody else would then load that sector, it would look up the base terrain type and the sector number, generate the sector, then go through the list of Deltas, making any changes, any additions, any removals that you did, so then it would load up, and you would see that sector the same way the other person just edited it, very cool.

However, we leverage this in-game by the player. For example, if the player dropped an item in a sector, we would just add that as a Delta, and this was really cool. Items knew were they in a sector, in a world, in which case they could store that this is the map and sector I'm on, or am I in a container or creature. In both cases, there's an XY where they're located, either an XY in the world or an XY in the inventory grid that we used, and items would store that, so that could be stored as a Delta. If you dropped say a sword, if you went to a random sector and dropped a sword in the game, we just said this sword, which we referenced by its object ID, is at dislocation. So we generated a Delta on that map. The sword would also confirm its location because it remembered where it was. I could go into it, but prototypes work the same way. If you had a sword, it just pointed to its prototype ID of the prototypical sword. The only thing would have to be stored in that sword is any Delta. So if, uh, if a designer had made a magic sword that had fire on it, we might change the art ID and the Damage range and the damage type, trivial. When you're in the game and the weapon gets damaged, we would store its current health, health points as a Delta. So if it said it had 20 Health, it had 20 Health, but then you looked up the max Health in the Prototype because that would never change. So that was pretty cool.

By the way, we had plans for much bigger Deltas in sectors. The world had electric put down structures, and those were also stored as Deltas. We were going to let players make structures, which would have been really cool, and they did that later in Fallout 4. We also had spells that could maybe change terrain type, maybe for a period of time, maybe permanently, and we could do that by just putting Deltas in the sectors. We never implemented these things, but it's there, and I thought that was really cool. Um, wow, I've already gone on for almost 15 minutes. Notice I haven't really gone in a tail about how structures are done. We also had something called facades. Facades were pre-rendered tiles that were laid down in a particular order. We used facades for things like certain large buildings and Trent, uh, the crash blimp was a facade. The rule for facades were, they didn't have to transition to anything, they were just laid down in the order the artist said, and that facade number was stored with an offset so that it knew exactly how to draw it to the map, then it drew all the other tiles not trying to transition into the facade, uh, tiles and facade tiles were automatically marked as blocked.

Yeah, and between sectors having unique numbers and destroying their deltas, and prototypes being the same way, we saved so much memory. And it also was the reason that Arcanum's world map was so big and could have been magnitudes of size bigger. We just didn't want a world that big, but you could create it with the world editor that shipped with the game. Anyway, I hope that was an interesting view into procedural train generation in a 90s isometric RPG.

Arcanums Original Attribute System.md
Youtube Link:
https://youtu.be/x5d5qkphn8o?si=mKmUIVPGa8Tqq4E6

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim. Today, I want to talk about the Arcanum attribute system, and specifically the original attributes, the way they were designed, not the ones we shipped with. And I'm answering a question someone asked. I'm sorry about this, like over a month ago, maybe almost six weeks ago, somebody asked what the how I came up with the beauty stat for Arcanum, which made me look at the design dock, which made me look at the original design dock, which made me go, "Whoa, I was planning to do something entirely different." So, let me talk about that.

So, brief refresher, if you remember the attributes for Arcanum, there were eight of them. They were physical and mental, and then there were these four categories called Power, resistance, prowess, prowess which I've never liked, and appearance. So, the physical ones were strength, con, Dex, and Beauty, and the mental ones were intelligence, willpower, perception, and charisma. That is not what the original plan was. The original plan had an entire third column called spiritual, which when I get into why I didn't use this, remember that. So, we had physical, mental, spiritual, and then the four areas were called Power, speed, resistance, and appearance. The idea was how strong were you in that area, how fast, how did you resist taking damage to that area, and then how did that area appear to other people.

This meant we had 12 attributes. The four physical ones were strength, dexterity, Constitution, and beauty, so not a big change there. The mental ones were intelligence, cleverness, willpower, and charisma. So, the new one there is the cleverness was how fast you could think on your feet. Like, I originally caught it witty, but witty and willpower, I was trying to come up with an acronym I never did. And then under spiritual, so for power, speed, resistance, appearance under spiritual, we did Passion, zeal, faith, and temperament.

So, bonus points for you playing along if you notice that I snuck some of those into the outer worlds. You're right. So, 12 attributes in three categories seemed initially like this is a great idea. I can attach these to a bunch of different things. They have different meaning, and they make sense because it's how strong I am physically, mentally, and spiritually, how fast I am, how resistant I am to anyone trying to hurt me in those three areas, and then how people perceive me in that area.

But we ran into problems. First of all, that's just way, way, way too many attributes. When I tried to figure out what all the derived statistics would be, there were just so many, and they were unbalanced. Like, strength and Dex ended up having a lot more derived attributes than zeal. But also, it was difficult to connect them because we had 16 skills, 16 that we shipped with. They were what, the combat, social, thieving, and Tech.

So, I was trying to figure out how to connect these 12 attributes to 16 skills, and there wasn't a good way to do it that ended up with them being nicely distributed. So, that was a problem, that was second problem with too many stats. The third problem was how to use them in perks because sometimes you did want an attribute to gate a perk. By the way, I've changed my mind on that. I didn't, now I don't like perks that are gated by things that you can't change within the game, and since attributes tend to be fixed, I didn't necessarily want to gate perks. But of course, we hadn't even decided where their attributes would be fixed, but there were a lot. That's a lot of attributes to choose from, and also, sometimes when it's like if you have something, and you're like, well, is it my intelligence or my willpower that should get this, is it my passion or my zeal.

So, it was hard to come up with things that made sense, and everybody agreed on. And then the other problem I had was how are people going to buy these if it's just here's a bunch of points. You had to give enough points because you have 12 attributes. That's a lot of points to be spread around, but what we noticed was people would just pick a few that they loved and pump them up really high and then dump the other ones, especially ones that didn't factor into anything they cared about on their character. By the way, the more attributes you put in a game, the more attributes there are for people not to care about. So, like if you literally never were going to talk to anybody, you could probably dump a lot of the intelligence and spiritual ones.

By the way, this is why later on, I started experimenting with the idea of geometric shapes for attributes because the problem with here's a bunch of attributes at hair points you can spend in any of them leads to the problem of if you want to give someone enough points that they can feel like they're having enough variety and character builds, you always end up the problem of people just buy up some a few things really high and lower other things, even in things that don't make sense, like how can someone be so strong and have no endurance or how can someone be brilliantly intelligent but absolutely no cleverness whatsoever. I mean, yeah, you can think of things that cover this, but there were all these combinations that made people go, I'm trying to imagine the character You're Building.

So, it always struck me that somewhere there was a way to introduce some kind of constraint without it being too too constraining or too hard to remember what it was, and a lot, by the way, a lot of point games do this. A lot of point games have things like you can't lower anything under a certain amount or you can't have more than one reduced to the lowest amount or you can have one more than one raise the highest amount, or there's just a whole bunch of different ways people have, and it's usually here's a bunch of points and then here's a bunch of random rules to assign, and that's why I thought shapes would help with that. Tried it in outer world, didn't make it past the testing phase. I still think there's a good idea in it. I'm just not smart enough to figure out what that idea is, maybe one of you will figure it out.

So, those were the problems I had just from there being so many attributes. Ran into some other problems with all those attributes, too. First of all, faith and spirit sounded religious, even though I didn't intend them to be religious. They were the non-mental parts of your inner being, like how emotional were you or how deep. Temperament's a perfect example. Temperament has nothing to do with your intelligence. Some people are just calm, and some people are not. So, I wanted to get those things across. Passion and Zeal just kept being confused and conflated in tester's minds. They were like, "I don't understand what the difference is between these two."

And also, your notice I didn't have perception in there, and I wanted perception or something like it, but if we added perception, if we added either a fifth thing or got rid of

 one of these, what is perception? Because for physical, you have both Sight and Sound, and they're used differently. Sight is used for ranged attacks but also seeing if someone's hiding, but also you can hear if someone's hiding. You can also hear maybe that you set off a trap, or you hear something out there, and it warns you that it's there. But those are both physical, and then for mental, I'm like, what is your mental version of perception? That I thought it was like something like observation, like yeah, you may see something, but did you know the importance of what it was you saw, like you know you saw that one of those books was a different color, but did it occur to you, hmm, I wonder if that book is a switch to open the bookcase, that kind of stuff. But there's only one of those, and then for Spiritual, I had no idea what perception was going to be, and I didn't want to introduce psychic perception. It was just, how did my inner mental being perceive the world, and I didn't know what to even call that much less what to make it control.

So, I ended up reeling it back and to just physical, mental, and I went with the the strength, context, and Beauty for physical for cerebral. I wanted an INT, willpower, and Charisma, but I knew I had to work perception in there, so I just put perception across from dexterity and said this is your prowess. This is how good you are in this area. It lost being speed and just about was about how good you were. For so for physical, it was how literally how fast you were, how dexterous you were, and then for intelligence, it was how good you are at noticing things. I never really liked that. It's what we went with.

Now, if you remember, I originally said in the previous video that the costs were supposed to go up, that higher values were supposed to cost more than lower ones. The reason I did this was that way, it would cost the same amount of points to be good at a number of attributes as it would be to be great at one attribute and average in the rest or to be great at several attributes and not so great, kind of bad at the others. I like that development of just instead of putting rules out there about you know if you you can't drop more than one below this or more than one above it just was like here's your points, higher things cost more than lower things, and that worked really well, especially worked well because we wanted. I wanted to give Auto perks, and we shipped with it, that you gained a perk automatically if you had an attribute of 20 in Arcanum. So, I love that.

But people could really abuse it by just pushing a lot of attributes up to 20 and a lot of other ones at one, especially ones they didn't care about, and they didn't get anything bad happening at one. So, we ended up shipping with the attributes we have now, which we're fine. I mean, they were, they they did their work, but the interesting thing about this, and you have to realize this if you go into game design, no one's ever happy. If you do the same kind of attributes a lot, people are like, "I've seen this. This is boring. Why are you mired in the past? You're an old developer." If you do new stuff, you're like, "Why did you fix it? It wasn't broken. This is, you're doing newness just to be new. This is a dumb idea," you know, those kind of constructive comments. So, it's really hard sometimes, even when you're doing something as fundamental as developing attributes, to come up with something new so it feels fresh but not so new that you incur the wrath of people are like, "I liked how the old one worked."

So, we end up shipping with the attributes that you know and love from Arcanum, but I've always thought about this attribute system for a number of reasons, which is a, it was different, but also, it was constructed with a foundational approach. It was not, "Hey, I I think I went luck. Let's throw it in." It was here are the categories and nature of an attribute, and then we filled in that Matrix with what I thought would be appropriate. We ended up doing it that way for Arcanum, but always in the back of my head, I've always wondered what those other ones could have done and what kind of game I could have made with them. You always, there's always new games to be made. So, I hope that gave you a little insight into where Arcanum's attributes eventually came from.

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim. Today I want to talk about AI. There's been a lot of people asking me my opinion on the rise of artificial intelligence in tools that are being used more and more frequently in game development and lots of other things. These are things like the LLMs like Chatbot or Chat GPT which are text-based or the art generators like Dolly or Stable Diffusion.

First off, let me say, while I do have a graduate degree in AI, it is from the '90s, so I am 30 years behind. Actually, wow, no, it's in '89. I am 34 years behind this stuff. But we had neural nets back then. I think a big thing about these new LLMs is just their sheer size, and the training sets are better. Yes, a lot of stuff has advanced, but given their nature, I kind of view them in the same light I viewed neural nets back then, which are they are great tools.

One issue with neural nets is you never know how they're coming up with their answer. You just give it input, and it gives you an output. Tracing through the neural network connections, especially ones as large as the current ones, isn't humanly possible. So, I don't foresee humans getting replaced by them. I don't think they should be replaced by them. In fact, what I think these AI tools are great for is what my old producer Eric DeMille used to call a force multiplier. I think these would be great to use in games to create more art, let one person make more art or more detailed art, or make early concept art before you really have any clear idea what you want. I still think those things should be done by humans who understand what you're trying to do rather than LLMs that have just been trained in areas adjacent to what you want to do because if you do that, if you go the AI route, I don't think you're going to get originality. You're just going to get variations on whatever themes you fed them.

But still, I can see in the game industry how these tools would be used. So, they walk through how I think I'd use them for art. As I mentioned, I think concept art is a great way of using this, especially when you're first starting to discuss a game, and you're like, well, what if we did this Art Deco? What if we did this, um, like, uh, sci-fi novel covers from the '50s? What if we did this as the style of Atari VCS game covers, you know, the one those painterly ones I'm talking about? Those are really cool. I could also see the art ones being used in game art and now in 3D now that they have 3D models, uh, that can be generated by AI. I can see the initial ones being created by AI or after a human has done a very detailed one, using AI to add more details or to make variations because you always want variations. You make some leather armor, and you want, "I need every artist that I'm talking about when someone tells them, okay, that's a great leather armor, can you make me 10 more variations?" Doing it any other way than just modifying the color is and it's got to be mind-numbing. That for the tool would be great for.

I see this a similar thing for narrative designers. Um, I see procedural narrative similar to what I tried to do in Arcanum, and I have a video on that, but much more powerful. I don't know if you'd want to use this for your main characters, but one problem that large RPGs have is you have hundreds, if not thousands, of side NPCs, and the idea of wasting a human's time on those NPCs when all they really ever say is, "What do you want to buy?" or "What are you doing in my house?" Let the AI do that.

Similarly, I see doing procedural levels in Cathedral maps for things like Dungeons and caves. I mean, imagine every game being able to be like Skyrim with all the hundreds of locations you can explore but being made by smaller teams. I think that's really exciting. Training an AI on making small explorable spaces like that, especially instances, is doable, and suddenly you can have small Indie teams make larger games, and I think that's really cool. I think that's a great way this tool can be used.

Similarly, um, and this is a narrative thing again, but I think side quests could be generated. The radiant quest AI in a lot of Bethesda games, I think that could be greatly expanded upon. I mean, imagine side quests that were being developed where there's just a type of quest, like whether it's a "I need this item" or "I need you to take care of these bad guys" or "I need you to escort this," although people don't like escort, or "I need you to um, take this item somewhere." These could all be generated by the AI for something appropriate to your level and your build and everything associated with it, the map you go to, the dialogue of the creatures there, that could all be generated by AI. And I think if they were given sufficient guidelines from people, I think it could be really fun. I wouldn't let the whole game made that way, but I certainly see a lot of the extra material being made that way.

Code is an interesting question. I used to think, okay, this isn't going to happen to programmers, but I have seen some really cool AI code generation, mostly helping a human. Having a human say, "Hey, I need you to, uh, I need some code right now to sort this list," or "I need you to find the value in in this thing that's closest to this. How would you recommend I store this data so I can be doing that search really quickly?" And I've seen AI generate, well, "I'll put it in the Heap." Those are really cool things, and I think that's something that could be explored.

Note, the theme in all this is, how can game development be made where we make bigger games, more expansive games, more reactive games, more visually detailed games, richer games, with people? I'm basically thinking of ways this AI could be used to reduce the development time, reduce bugs, reduce the team size needed, not so that you can hire fewer people. You're still going to want big teams for certain games, but so that Indies can make more games and smaller devs can make more games that currently require a Blizzard or a Bungie or an Epic.

So, one thing that I was thinking of too, that I've been thinking of a lot lately is, because I keep all my music online, and I use this device which I can't name; it will activate. I play music all the time, all throughout the day, except when I'm filming these. I'm usually listening to music. I'm listening to music when I'm cooking, I'm listening to music when I'm coding, I listen to music in the car.

Music streaming services, across the board, are pretty bad. I really want a music service that I can upload my music to. Like I've mentioned before, I've got a lot of ambient music. I own it on CDs, I

've ripped it, I like to listen to it. I wish I could listen to it anywhere. So, I prefer music streaming services that let me upload music, which really restricts the music services I can listen to.

Oddly, even though I've been using this one for years, its AI hasn't figured out my preferences. I don't like live songs. I don't like remastered songs. I like the original one that I'm used to. I don't like censored songs. I'm not 10; you don't need to take curse words out of my songs. Oddly, when I ask this thing, just play music, it often starts with one of 10 to 15 songs all the time. One time it kept doing a song that I told it I hated. It was "Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer," and I have no idea why I thought I wanted to hear that song over and over and over. It was very difficult to get it to stop doing that. I don't own it; I never told it I liked it. So, the why, when I just told her to play music, that song appeared in the first dozen, I have no idea.

But one thing I've always wanted it to do is take context into account. Look at where I'm located, which you can tell by what of these home devices pick up my voice. Is it one in my office? Is it the one in the bathroom? Is it the one in the living room? Am I in my car, which you can tell from location services if I'm not at home? I'm in my car. So, I wish it would take into account kind of day, day of week, and location. I don't want to hear ambient music when I'm driving my car. I don't want to hear Hard Rock when I'm at my desk. These are things that I feel like I could do, but it doesn't do, and this is where some of these new AIs, I think, would do a great job at improving streaming services and their guess of what people want to listen to music. I still want new music given to me, but I would think from the years of data you have of music I've asked for or specifically said I liked that you can figure out what kind of music I like, but I've yet to discover a streaming service that has a really good grasp of the music I like or can serve me up new music. I had to discover witch house on my own. Once I started telling it to play specific witch house songs, then I learned a lot more new songs, but I had to do that. I wish for once it would throw something at me and have me go, "I've never heard this genre before in my life," and I've yet to have that happen.

So, beyond game development, I'm really excited about all this new AI and what it could be used for. Yes, there's a lot of bad things that could be used for. The worst thing I'm worried about is either misinformation, especially political misinformation, or just making it another channel for advertising because in the history of human beings, anytime we develop a form of communication, whether it's talking, writing, TV, radio, internet, whatever, we always eventually just jam it full of advertisements. So, I'm sure this is going to happen, but I don't think that's a fault of AI. I just think that's how humans are. Anyway, I'm remaining cautiously optimistic about this AI, and I hope it really does come through. Anyway, that's my ideas on AI and Game Dev and Beyond.

Attribute Design.md

https://youtu.be/G_2kCbPO2sU?si=VffxYDBIGIQv0h0H

Hi everyone, it's me Tim. Today, I want to talk about attributes in role-playing games in general because the last couple of days I've talked about specifically the attributes in Fallout and in Arcanum, and it made me think, wow, you know, not only have my thoughts changed since then, there, I've been in so many discussions about attributes. I've seen lots of RPGs that handle our attributes differently. Plus, someone even mentioned in the comments that I was saying how Dex was so overpowered in GURPS in a much earlier video where I talked about the GURPS apps I made, including a combat one, a combat simulator. But then in Fallout and in Arcanum, I did the same thing, and you're right, I'm totally guilty. I remember both of those design sessions that led up to that, and in every case, it just seemed appropriate that dexterity would be involved in those skills or derived stats.

So, I've gotten better, and I have some ideas on that, but I want to kind of talk too about this is me spitballing ideas. I don't think I have the absolute design Fiat on how to do attributes, but at the same time, just thinking that way made me go, that's what I really miss about so long ago at Interplay when we made Fallout. People often say, hey, what was the Special Sauce? What was so amazing about it? And Leonard and I like to talk about the combination of humor and darkness, and I've talked about how we're all going in the same direction, vision-wise, and things like that. But one thing I really missed were those brainstorming sessions around the conference table, eating pizza. And the reason for that was, for whatever reason, I ended up with a group of people who really liked to chew on ideas. Somebody would make a suggestion, and we'd talk about it, and we'd say, well, this is what would be the result if we do what you said, this would be the results, the good things, and the bad things. And then we talk about, well, how could we fix the bad things? Not, hey, you, what's your idea, you better fix it. Or it was, okay, that's ideal, let's run with it, let's run with it for 15 minutes and see where we end up. And I miss that because since then, I've run into all kinds of other people who think brainstorming is totally different, and it's set up either it means come with an idea and don't listen to anyone else, or just say everything's dumb. In fact, you know what, at one point, I do a whole video on how I think brainstorming session should go and the horrors I've seen in some brainstorming sessions, but that's a totally different video. All I can say is on this one, when you make comments, just try to be a good person, understand that you aren't 100% right, you don't have the cornerstone of objectivity.

So now, let's talk about attributes. I'm going to start with talking about how attributes can be bad. Specifically, the arguments I often hear about, oh, this game uses attributes. One, they're very hard to balance, and that's true, and I will talk about why that's true in a bit. But I also want to say that the other huge criticism is attributes are often something someone complains about because you have to make that creation, and therefore they're fixed, and you have to make that selection before you've ever played the game. And so you have to go, like, do I really need this higher strength, not knowing that your favorite weapon is later in the game has a minimum strength, and it might be below what you've picked, or it might be above what you've picked. Just the fact that character players need to decide on these before they've ever played the game, even if it's a replayable game, you still face this at your first character, that's a bad thing.

But the other one, which I was saying, where, hey, there's no matter how you make the attributes in range. If you make attributes have a really small range, say zero to five, or even sometimes zero to ten, but zero to five is a really big small range, then any in-game bonus you get for an attribute is huge. I mean, if you had an attribute range go from zero to five, even a plus one puts you 20% higher. And if there are lots of things to give bonuses or if bonuses stack, like you can put on an item that gives you plus one strength and then take a drug that gives you a plus one strength, you just covered 40% of the range that strength can even be in. However, if you flip it around and say, well, we do a big range like one to 100, then the problem with that is when you spend points on it in character creation, it doesn't feel like you're getting much bang for your buck. The difference between a 17 and an 18 strength when the range is one to 100 is minuscule.

I still remember, I was really into EverQuest. In fact, one day, I'll do a video, and I know people are getting tired of me going, I'll do a video on this, but I really got into MMOs for a few years, and I loved EverQuest. It was one of the first graphical MMOs I played, but it's AC range was zero to a thousand. And I used to see people in that game argue over who gets the new cloth drop that would change their AC from 16 to 17, and I remember thinking, is there really on a scale of one to a thousand a big difference between 16 and 17? I don't care, but people would fight over it. So if you have a big range, too small of a range, bonuses are too powerful, too big of a range, and spending points at character creation doesn't mean anything.

So notice that don't throw out anything you can spend points on. That's true for skill ranges or perks that can stack and all that. But because you have to pick attributes right at the start of the game where you really don't know what the game is going to feel like and what the game is going to punish you for having too low or reward you for having really high, attributes feel specifically sensitive to that criticism. So you may go, well, why'd we even use attributes at all? Well, I love attributes because they make different classes and different races and different backgrounds feel meaningfully different.

So, a perfect example of that that stuck with me for almost my whole career is the original AD&D, D&D version one for newer kids. There was extra strength you got if you rolled an 18, but only if you were playing a fighter class, fighter, ranger, paladin, and that's when you roll percentile dice. So you had 18 from 01 to 1800. That was really cool, and I remember later when I introduced AD&D to some people, they got really upset about, hey, my magic user has an 18, how come I don't get to roll? And I thought it was cool because it made fighters extra special, especially in a game when you have a game that's classes, the

 classes all tend to feel a little samey, and I think D&D fixed that later on with lots of feats and class abilities that you can choose to buy.

But I also think that attributes are really cool if any in-game bonuses for them are really rare. Like, I could see making them impossible to get, like there is nothing that adds to your strength. Instead, there are things that add to things that strength does. So if strength gives you a bonus carry weight and a bonus damage, then there are things in the game that can increase your carry weight and there are things in the game that can increase your bonus damage, but there's nothing that gives you a bonus to strength. I think that's a cool way to treat attributes.

I've noticed that as gaming has evolved, another thing I've seen with attributes is attributes used to start in the middle, and if you went below, you got penalties, and if you went above, you got bonuses. And I've seen a lot of games change it so that there's always a bonus associated with it, and if you move it down, your bonus goes down, and if you move it up, your bonus goes up. I've even seen people talk about this, other designers, and they say, oh, we replaced the carrot stick model with the little carrot, big carrot model. If you're wondering, I first saw this obviously done and discussed that way for World of Warcraft. And I even talked to some of the World of Warcraft developers, and they even said specifically, yes, we did that deliberately. And a lot of people think that's the same thing. What's the difference between having penalties and bonuses versus tiny bonuses and big bonuses? Well, it's a really big distinction if subsequent rules in the game treat bonuses and penalties differently. For example, let's say dexterity at the middle is zero, and if you reduce it, it penalizes your AC, and if you increase it, it improves your AC. Then let's say you put in heavy armor and you say heavy armor negates dexterity bonuses. So basically, when you wear heavy armor, you can't move around that much, so being able to jump around with high dex isn't going to help you. But if you are clumsy outside of heavy armor, you're still going to be clumsy in heavy armor, so the penalty still applies.

Why I like that was suddenly lowering, if all the attributes work that way, suddenly lowering an attribute is very different in a system that has penalties and bonuses because those penalties may not be something you can get rid of, where if it's just, here's a low bonus to a high bonus, you're always getting a bonus, and who cares if your bonus is a little lower? Those are things that I see, those are like the subtle parts of design that some people either don't know about or deliberately ignore when they're making systems, and I think those are really cool things to talk about, and they really factor into how you would make your game.

In fact, let me talk now about how I would try to balance attributes when I put them in because I don't think I've done a really good job of balancing them, as that commenter pointed out. My dexterity is not the most balanced of attributes in Fallout or Arcanum. One thing I would do is for all the skills and derived stats that are based on attributes, I would have them be based on multiple attributes, not just one. In this way, if you have something like dexterity that adds into a lot of attributes, you could have its contribution not be as high. So, for example, disarm traps could be based on perception and dexterity, but because dexterity adds into a lot of things perception does it, you could have perception add more. So every point of perception may add five points to your disarm traps, where every point of dexterity adds a couple of points to your disarm traps. And that way, you can drop dexterity affect a lot of skills, but it's kind of a secondary addition, and there's still a more primary attribute that's factoring in, and you can do that with all of the derived stats like carry weight or armor class or things like that.

You can also try to make attributes self-balancing, and I've seen people do rules for that. I've tried to make it cost more to raise than to lower. I've seen games that say you can't have more than one attribute below eight, so people can't just lower a bunch of things and have a couple of amazing stats and everything else is horrible, and then they just never in the game talk to anybody, or they use a lot of companions to carry things, so they don't care that their charisma or their strength is low. I've also tried shapes, you know, so like you have a triangle, and you're like, hey, if you do it this way, this, this, that's really good, and these two are only okay, and if you do it like this, these two are pretty good, but this one's terrible. And the idea of using shapes was just, I don't have to give you a rule saying, hey, you can have one great and two okay, or you can have two good and one bad. Rather than give you that rule, I just, here's the shape, spin it anywhere you want. The rule is built in. And we're very visual, so for people who think, oh, I'd rather have numbers, it's like, great, that's great that you want numbers. A lot of people don't want numbers, and that means I don't want to get rid of numbers. I always want the underlying mathematics to be something you can see. It's just, you're just about to play a game, and it's throwing a bunch of numbers at you, and you don't even know what they apply to.

There was another game, well, people say, well, in D&D, it was random, and that works great. But as somebody who made Temple, I knew people were just gonna reroll until they got numbers they wanted, so we even put the reroll button in there. That's just what people do. I mean, most GMs don't go, oh, you don't like what you did, roll again. Most GMs, you rolled it, and you accept your roles. But now, here's an interesting, this is an older game, it's called Amber Diceless, based in Roger Zelazny's Amber Universe. What was really cool about this RPG, and it's a tabletop RPG, was the characters were given a hundred points, but rather than spending them on their attributes, they had to bid on attributes in a player-wide auction managed by the DM. And this is why this was brilliant. Let's say several people want to be strong, strong, and you're beating, I'm the strongest in the group, and that's how Amber Diceless worked. It was like your attribute was either okay or you were the best. People, somebody goes, hey, I want to bid on strength, I'll bid 20 points. Okay, next two bits 25. Well, if you want it, you're gonna be 26 or 30 or 40 or whatever, so it goes up, and when strength eventually gets sold to the highest bidder, that bidder loses those points to spend. So now, going into

 the next bid, he doesn't have 100 anymore. He may have 40 points left over, depending on who bid him, and people might try to outbid someone hoping that they're a bit higher because what they really want is another attribute, and they want people to be lower on points, and they can win. Of course, that can fail. If you bid higher and everybody goes, I'm out, and now you're, well, I guess I'm the strongest when I really wanted to be the most graceful or I wanted to be the smartest.

So, it adds a whole clever level in there that I've never really seen in any other tabletop RPG. I don't know how to translate that into a single-player computer game. Who would you bid against? Maybe you could make your companions that way, but because it's always you bidding, you would know whether or not you really wanted that attribute, and it just doesn't work. But I'm just saying, it was a really clever idea that I saw, and I'm sure there are more clever ideas out there. I just don't see them as much. So, other people think that maybe a way of balancing attributes is just to get rid of them, to have a game that doesn't have attributes. I don't disagree with this, but I think in order to do that, you better have a very, very good perk, trait, and flaw system. And the reason I think you need all three is you need perks for things like, hey, I'm gonna make a strong character, and you buy that perk, and then suddenly your carry weight's high, or you may have a trait called big and clumsy, and then you get stronger, but your dexterity is lower. So, that's the balance. Or you may have a flaw, weak, and your character's really weak. The perks and flaws could come later in the game, and by buying a perk or getting a flaw, that system itself is balanced. When you buy one perk, you're not getting another perk. When you get a flaw, you usually get something else to go along with it, and then the trait is self-balanced. So that is a way you could go with attributes.

For my final thoughts on them, because I'm not sure, I mean, if I had to pick it right now, I'd probably do it as attributes with a small range that are permanent, and things in the game never adjust your attribute directly. They only can adjust things your attributes affect. So, for example, if there was strength, there might be power armor that instead of giving you a bonus to your strength when you wear this power armor, you can carry more. And then there'd be a mod for that power armor like hydraulic arms that lets you effectively have a higher strength for determining weapons that have a minimum strength. But then you can do fun things like that mod has weight. So when you add that mod, yeah, you can now use weapons with a higher minimum strength, but the carry bonus you get from the armor, power armor, is lower. I love that because there's a lot of knobs to turn, and you can balance things. I am concerned that a lot of games seem to be getting rid of attributes but not adding anything back. In fact, I'll just say it specifically because I know I've said this publicly elsewhere, I'm concerned about Fallout 5 directly. Yes, I watch all the Fallouts, and I see what they do. Fallout 3 got rid of traits, and I'm really like, traits, traits were those wonderful self-balanced things you buy at character creation. And then Fallout 4 got rid of skills, they're just gone, which mainly made Fallout 4 was special plus perks. I'm really concerned maybe Fallout 5 is just going to be perks, that there won't even be special. I mean, I don't know what's going on there, but there certainly is a trend to eliminate choice at character creation.

And I also say, I really prefer games now that offer some kind of negative characteristics. I like flaws, I like weaknesses, I like low attributes. It should be pretty obvious from all the games of mine you've ever played, whatever you want to call them, whatever type you want to put in, I like that because I think it makes characters much more fun and much more challenging to play and much more memorable. I just, there's something about playing a hero that's not perfect that I find fun, and I think a lot of other people find fun. So when you lose attributes, or if you have attributes that only have bonuses, I think you lose some of that. So that's what I would probably do going forward. I hope you like this long-winded attribute monologue.
Title: 
Bad Games

Youtube Link:
https://youtu.be/vp17yIB6Ijo?si=SZTAvwXs69MIp0rR

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim. Today, I want to talk about "bad" games, and I'm laughing even saying that because I think it's such a weird term, and it can mean so many different things. Just before I even dive into it, bear in mind I've already done a video on what I think makes a game good, which I'll link below, and the data, the objective data on my games, which I'll also link below. So, I kind of reference both of those in here, but you might want to watch them first to see where I'm coming from in this one.

So, first of all, when people say a game is bad, it's kind of a weird, it's kind of a vague term because do they mean it's low selling? Do they mean the review scores are low? Do they mean the budget was small, in which case, why don't they just say it's a cheap game? But "cheap" has its own connotations. But no, usually, people just say it's a bad game, you shouldn't play it, it's a bad game.

Now, it's fine if you say, "I think this game is bad." It's fine if you say, "I don't like this game." It's even fine if you say, "I hate this game." That's true for a lot of things. But what's nice about those phrases is they're all obviously subjective. And yes, there are some of you who go, "That's a bad game," and what you really mean is, "I think it's a bad game." But there are some of you who say, "That's a bad game," and you mean it is 100% objectively bad across the board and no one should play it, and your word is the final word.

Now, if that's not what you mean, you can skip over what I'm about to say, but if it is what you mean, if you really think that your take on a game is 100% objectively objective truth for everyone, not only are you wrong, you're also probably a narcissist. Now, because of that, everything I say from now on is just going to deflect right off that narcissism shield, but you should probably know, you get talked about in the game development circles. Narcissists are well-known and discussed. We will never say anything about it publicly. Well, I will, but you wouldn't if you're working on a game because you don't want the people who end up not liking you. "He called me a narcissist." No, I'm not calling... If you don't like one of my games, you're not a narcissist. If you think my games are objectively 100% bad, and they're bad for everyone, and anyone who likes it is stupid, yeah, you're probably a narcissist.

Um, and that's where things get weird about people talking about games. They go into this deep dive of, "Here's all the things that are bad about this game," and a lot of things they're talking about fall into, like, for someone who likes the game, it's either a feature no one cares about, like when I talked about how hard we work to make feet not slide and fall out in Arcanum, a lot of you said, "Oh no, that was really important. I love that." But we spent a lot of time on it, I mean, a lot of time, and I keep thinking back, going, "What could we have done? What could we have fixed? What new feature could we have added if we hadn't spent that much time on that?" To some people, those feet sliding wouldn't matter. How do I know? What's Diablo? Their feet slide all over the place. It looks like they're skating around in an ice rink. It came out a year before Fallout. Nobody cared. Nobody cared.

So similarly, there are other things people don't care about. You think the writing is juvenile. Other people don't care about that. Um, I don't like romance in my RPG writing, and it kind of makes me go, uh, and I often think it's poorly, poorly done. It makes everybody in the world feel like this, you know, everybody in the world is a horny bisexual person. It makes your world skew in a weird thing that you may not be thinking you're skewing, but you are. But in no way would I think that makes a game bad for everyone, especially in a lot of them, you can just avoid it. Just ignore it, don't do it. So that's why I often say, yeah, I don't really like this game, or I don't play this game. But I rarely talk about games I don't like because I stop playing them. If you don't see me talk about a game on this channel, it's because I haven't played it, or I played it and I didn't really like it, so I didn't finish it, and I don't have anything to say about it.

Um, but I've seen people say things like, a good example, people say this about all of them. There are people who don't like the original Fallouts or Arcanum or Temple or Bloodlines. But let me talk about, like, Outer Worlds. There are people on this channel go, "Outer Worlds is bad. It's just bad." And they're asked questions, they're like, "Hey Tim, why do you think the Outer Worlds is so bad?" I'm just asking, as if that question is objective, like we've defined that it's bad, and now we want your explanation on that. Well, first of all, all I can tell you is, look at the reviews. Tons of people liked it. They continue to like it. The review score has not changed. This game has been out almost five years at the time of this video. It's been four and a half years since Outer Worlds came out. The scores have not changed. It has sold millions of copies and continues to do so. So for the people go, "Oh, people got tricked into buying it," or whatever, people are still buying it. No one's tricking them, saying that you like were tricked into thinking it was going to be Fallout New Vegas. Millions of games come out that say, "Made by the person who made this." And if you look at Outer Worlds, you can see the Fallout genealogy in it.

Now, it got two DLCs, two expansions, and is getting a sequel. And for all of you who say it is objectively bad, how do you explain that? Especially, look at Fallout. Fallout went out, didn't sell that well, but you know, Interplay liked it, and it was reviewing well, so they immediately made a sequel. They made a quick sequel. I mean, I left before it was done, but that thing was done in less than a year. It was pushed out the door, and it reviewed well too. Didn't sell that great. Proof, Interplay wasn't doing well. If Fallout had been selling millions or tens of millions of copies, they would have made a third one. But they didn't. So all I can say is, if something goes out and reviews well, and you think it's good

, and it doesn't sell well, that may be why a company isn't making it, not because it's bad.

So all I'm trying to say here is, I hope you understand watching this that "bad" is subjective. I don't think that there is any game on Steam, and mention it in a comment if you can find it, find me a game on Steam that has 100% negative reviews. No mixed review, no positive review, just 100% negative. I tried to find that on IMDb because IMDb has, you can look at their bottom game, bottom movies. People still like Manos, Hands of Fate, which is one of the lowest-scoring movies ever made. But there are people like it, um, and not the MST version, The Mystery Science Theater.

So, just acknowledge, "bad games," what you mean by "bad games" are bad for you. And sure, keep on saying you, you don't like it, you didn't like it, here are the reasons you didn't like it. But if you start arguing with someone over something you didn't like that they did, understand that that argument, at its basis, is fruitless. You're arguing over whether chocolate is better than vanilla. I mean, the answer is chocolate, but there are people out there that argue vanilla. Are they wrong? Am I wrong? It's taste. And to think that your taste is 100% objective, defined, scientific truth, that's scary. I know some people like to talk like that, but they don't really believe it, okay? But if you really believe it, I'd stop talking like that.

Um, anyway, I've said before, on any game I've put out, I can point elements I didn't like, some elements I didn't even want. That's normal. When you play a game, it's normal not to like all of it. And if you find yourself being one of these people that once you like a game, you can't even think of anything wrong with it, and you're like that with a lot of games, you may be a little guilty of black-and-white thinking, where once you like something, everything about it is perfect, and once you hate something, everything about it is bad. Try to look at games as nuanced and nuanced product. Decide what it is you like and what it is you don't like about every game, and that will help you find new games.

And I've said it before, try to find reviewers who think like you do. Um, I've mentioned before, Mortismal Gaming. One reason I like watching Morm review things is he waits until he does it to 100%. So when he's playing a game, he will go, "I'm not going to tell you whether I liked it or not because I want to see all of it." That way, it may have a rough start but get really good, or may be really good and just get horrible at the end, and then he talks about that. I love the other day, he was doing a narrative RPG, and he said, "Things look good so far, but I haven't finished the story." And narrative games succeed or failure based on their narrative. If you're going to put out a game and you're going to go, "This is a narrative game, this is the reason we're missing these features, it's the reason we're not really strong in these other game elements because we're a narrative game," well then, it's okay for people to judge you on your narrative.

So I like his reviews. His reviews often line up with how I feel about games. Not 100%, but usually, if Morm likes a game, I'll like it. If he doesn't like it, I won't like it, for the same reasons. So I recommend that you find a reviewer like that. If you don't want to buy a bunch of games, find a reviewer like that and use their reviews, or buy it on Steam where you can return it in a short period of time if you don't like it, or hope, well, if they have a demo, less games have demos now, or just waiting to see what like your friends think about it, or enough reviews come out that you think you can make an educated guess on whether you like it.

I've played games that didn't review well that I loved. Same thing with movies. There are movies that came out that I, that reviewed horribly, and I watched, I'm like, "This movie is brilliant." Similarly, there are some movies out there, and some of them surprise my friends that all my friends loved. I know you guys love, people assume I love because of the games I've made, and I think they were royally stinker of movies. But that's just because they didn't, they didn't have what I wanted in a movie. So same thing with games. It's all subjective. It's fun to talk about. Just try not to think of yourself as the last word. And that's all I want to say.

Beginnings.md

https://youtu.be/NnlnJSaj6z0?si=Wt4NkCVZIv2TWoyD

Hi everyone, it's me Tim, and today I want to talk about the beginning of a game. I want to talk about why that's so important. I'm going to answer a question from Shadow Dragon Dev who asks, "What are your thoughts on what makes a good or bad beginning for a game? Beginning not just as when you press new game but also as in you first open the game program itself. That entire first impression a player gets at the very start of their experience with it."

That's a good question. In fact, I'm not even going to mention that that experience starts even earlier, but I'll get to that. I think it's interesting that this question came in before I put up my video about making and maintaining IPs because some of the stuff I talk about in there will have to do with this. But let me just, you know, go over how important the beginning of a game is. It is, it's really important. You only get one chance to make that first impression. And I was thinking about how important it was, and then I remembered something I really liked. I really like the original Dune movie. I'm in a minority there, but I think Princess Irulan says it best. So, let's see what she has to say.

"A beginning is a very delicate time." Okay, so beginning is a delicate time. Let's keep that in mind. Also, the beginning is really, really hard to do, especially for a new IP. It's, when people don't really know what they're, they have in store, what's coming up, you don't have a whole lot of time to get them involved and engrossed and imagining all the fun they're going to have in your game. And for a new IP, what they know nothing about, I mean, that's hard enough to do on a game they may have already played a few games. Excuse me, I just always have congestion. But on a new IP, it's just really hard to convey that.

It used to be, and this is why I'm going to say it's even before the player runs the executable, before he used to have the box to help. We were very careful with the Fallout box to put lots of screenshots on it. We wanted all the parts of the box to look evocative. It looked like a rusty lunch box, I think is what Leonard was thinking it would be. The manual itself looked like a found item from within the world. It had, it was told from a very funny point of view. It had funny cartoons of Vault Boy in various bad situations. There were Vault-Tech ads and the recipes and everything. It just felt like something that fell out of the Fallout universe.

And keep in mind that for a lot of people, until recently, the installation process took long enough that during the installation process, that's when people would look at the manual and the box, and sometimes the installation itself would put up screenshots or even a cinematic movie. So you even had that time to make an impression on the player before they'd even played the game. Nowadays, installations tend to take seconds or minutes, not hours like they used to. And even when that's happening, even the ones that do take a long time, you're basically just watching a bar, like on your console, fill up. A lot of times, you can do it in the background, especially if you're buying digitally. And so, the digital storefront is now important, and it has screenshots and a cinematic or two for people to look at before they buy. But also, remember that a lot of places like Steam offer refunds if you don't like it in the first, I think Steam is 20 minutes or an hour, something like that. I've never returned a game. To me, I've always felt like you have 10 minutes to grab someone's attention. If you can't express the game, it's going to be, and get them really interested and involved in playing it in the first 10 minutes, you're probably going to lose a lot of people.

Now, that used to be, I would say, you used to have 30 minutes. Now I'm saying 10. I'm wondering if it's even shorter now. People, I don't know if it's people's attention spans or the fact that there's just so much out there. While they're watching something, they're like, "I could be playing half a dozen other things right now." But for whatever reason, that first few minutes of a game are super important.

Now, I don't think I always did that well with that. A lot of people, even before we launched Fallout, a lot of people were complaining on the team and in QA and other people at Interplay that the beginning of it was too slow and too brutal. The beginning of Fallout is, you step out the vault door, this is after you've made your character and watched the opening cinematic saying, "Go find the water chip." You step out the vault door, it closes behind you, and now you're in a cave, and you have to walk around and explore that cave, trying to find a way out while rats are attacking you. Personally, I think, with the sensibilities I have now, that is the wrong way to do it. I would have started it showing a cinematic of the player going outside into a very bright desert, and then resolving that into the isometric view, where the player can see, very close nearby, there are like rats chewing on something, and like a body or something, and you can see equipment. Now, if you want that equipment, which you might, you're going to have to fight those rats. If you want to avoid them, you can sneak away, or probably just walk directly away from where they are. And I want that to be like lesson one of the Wasteland: you don't always have to fight, you can avoid it. And but if you do want to fight, decide what you're fighting for. You know, you can see maybe, maybe he's got a gun and a box of ammo sitting next to him. Know what you're fighting for, know what you're getting into, and know what kind of character you made. That's the problem I had with the Fallout intro, was you could make a talking character, but the first thing you're doing is fighting rats. Now, we threw that in there because we thought it was important for the, for anyone to know how to fight, especially before they went on the Overland map and were dropped into encounters that, if they couldn't run away from, they'd at least be shot at a few times.

This is what led to the whole Fallout 2 Temple of Trials thing, which is when marketing said, "Hey, you have to have a tutorial, and it has to be unskippable, and you have to teach things about how the game is played." That probably came out of the fact that we didn't do as good a job in Fallout 1 of teaching the game. I get that, still doesn't make me like Fallout 2's Temple of Trials any better. I still think that was a nightmare of a way of starting a game, especially that it's not skippable. It's for the same reason Fallout 3's intro bothers me. It's like, "I don't want to play through me growing up

 in the vault. I played through it once. I don't want to do that anymore. I want to skip it and go. Does let me make my character and jump outside."

So, I have trouble with intros that are too long and unskippable. So, I think Arcanum, we did a really interesting thing with that, because we knew Arcanum wasn't known. So, when Arcanum started up, after it said Sierra and Troika, it had an opening cinematic that was just a few seconds long, that showed two people in classic medieval-looking armor that were obviously dueling, and one of them's walking up to the other, and he's got his sword out, and the sword starts to glow, so you know it's magical, and then, whoa, the second guy just pulled out a gun and shot it at him. That was a lot of Arcanum condensed into one short, just three or four-second cinematic of, "This is a fantasy game, it's set in medieval time, but there are guns, there's magic, but there's also guns." So, I thought that was a much better way of kind of expressing the concept of Arcanum than a cinematic that somebody may skip or look away from or whatever. You've just installed this thing, it's starting up, we've got you. Don't blow it, just in a few seconds, just kind of give them that little thing, and then boom, they're at the main menu. What do you want to do?

So, I think Arcanum encapsulates what I'm trying to tell you here, which is the opening has to stress the very simple, distinctive essence of your IP. And if this sounds a lot like that video I made about making and maintaining an IP, that's why I mentioned it at the beginning of this video. Once you have that essence, that should permeate all your design docs, and if you talk to a publisher, should be part of your elevator pitch, and should be supported by your design pillars, and all the things I've been saying on this channel for months. When you do that opening, you have to figure out the fastest, shortest way of taking that distinct, simple essence of your IP and compressing it down and putting it in a cinematic. And it should be evocative, it should be fun to watch because you want people to actually look at this thing and figure out what your game is and then want to play it. And by that, I mean they should be thinking of things like, "I wonder what kind of character I want to make. I wonder what's out there. I think the first thing I want to do is go look for this. I wonder if you can have magic guns. I wonder if there are any kind of technological dragons out there. What, what, like, boom, what is going on here?" That's what people should be thinking in the very beginning of your game.

So, I'll say what Princess Irulan said: "A beginning is a delicate time." It's hard to do this. I've messed up many times in doing this, but I think done well, this is the best way of pulling people into your game before they've even played it. So, I hope that that answers your question, Shadow Dragon Dev.

**Introduction**

foreign it's me Tim and today I want to talk about board games. Charlie K 5964 asks do you ever play board games if so what do you look for in board games you enjoy versus video games or tabletop games. that's good question I really haven't talked about them much but I know people have seen them on the bookcases so I'll start with saying I play board games a lot more when I was younger especially when I was like a kid before I got into d d my brother he's two years older than me he and I used to play board games all the time when we were kids we used to play Risk and life and Monopoly just you know all the classics and I was so into it that when I was 10 I actually even made a board game it was over the summer you know I think I was bored and we had a lot of construction paper and stuff so I put together a board of the Caribbean where the Bermuda Triangle was and every player had a ship and you were trying to go around trade routes and pick up stuff that you could sell and there was a chance of weird stuff happening in the Bermuda Triangle so you had to pick cards and weird things could happen and it could end up with you losing some or most of your cargo or possibly your ship or possibly kicked out of the game I had no chance of balance but I did that and what was weird about it was that was the summer I was 10. that Christmas for I got from my mom a board game called the Bermuda Triangle that had come out and I remember thinking wow this is just this is very similar it wasn't exactly it was just like my game and the first thought is like they stole my game yeah they were spying on a 10 year old kid in Alexandria Virginia but later I was like wow I guess everybody has ideas lots of people have ideas and that was the Genesis of me thinking ideas are not the important part and I could do a whole video on that and maybe I need to because I see a lot of comments implying the opposite ideas are not that important it's the ability to express them whether you're a designer writing it down or an artist converting it into some piece of art or a programmer making code if you can't express your idea it's not that worthwhile anyway I digress so I like looking at board games even today because they have really good ideas in them I've talked about how I used to buy tabletop role-playing games and supplements for them because I like just looking through them for their ideas I thought there was some really active creative stuff going on in that space still feel that way now um people have seen gloomhaven I'm not picking up that box it's huge I did buy it I had a lot of fun reading through the rules looking at all the pieces organizing all the pieces it's a big game I ended up playing the digital version because a it was right before the pandemic there were some people playing gloomhaven at obsidian but I was busy trying to get um outer worlds and and the DLCs out and packing and getting ready to move to Seattle so I ended up not playing it so once I moved up here I got the digital version and played that it's fun I really like it lots of good ideas in it um what I played most lately I've played a lot of solo tabletop games because in the pandemic I lived I lived in Seattle where I didn't know anybody and everything was in lockdown so the first thing I think I bought a few months after I moved up here was box one which is a puzzle box game really fun um it's made by Neil Patrick Harris which if I can digress it's an amazing game and here's somebody who started acting when he was a kid he's an amazing actor singer if you haven't watched Dr Horrible's Sing-Along Blog you should watch it dancer presenter I mean and now he's making games he's like that's that's my thing I mean he's even gayer than I am I mean leave a little for the rest of us Neil I'm kidding please makes box one two as soon as you're done with Doctor Who anyway back to box one um it was really fun spreading it out on the coffee table and doing it I think I did it all most in one day and then I finished it up the next day really good puzzles things that make you think um one danger of that is I have a Labrador Retriever and she has happy lab tail and of course she saw me sitting next to the coffee table so she runs over and her tail sweeps everything off the coffee table so I lost about 15 minutes trying to reassemble where I was happy lab tail it can lead to tragedy it should be studied I bet you I have a lab because I am the equivalent I get really excited about things and and I think that scares people around me anyway I digress again so another game I played and I did pick up One Deck Dungeon this one because it's not as big this is called one deck dungeon I love this game made by Chris seismic this was super fun super fun um I bought it played it a while on the coffee table loved it so much ended up buying it digitally on I think I bought it on my phone and then ended up buying it on Steam it is one of the few games on Steam that I have 100 all the achievements and it then inspired me I kicked open unity and made my own game I mentioned it once in the video I had done a long time ago when I was having insomnia and I showed off my game toys but that was the Yahtzee sort of dice game that I made completely inspired by one deck dungeon different very different but you can see the connection between the two and by the way another digression I haven't touched that game in months it's part of the reason I like not making games professional anymore I have an idea now I create it and then I get to some point where either I'm bored with the idea I think in that case what happened was I got to the point where it did need better art which I couldn't do and I get frustrated making UI I appreciate really well done UI but when I'm actually coding UI it is painstakingly detailed you know counting pixels and getting things lined up and I'm just like I don't want to do this so I ended up walking away from it and you know what I can doesn't disappoint anybody I didn't have a contract I nobody was expecting it I played with it and then I moved on so that's another reason I like looking at tabletop RPGs and board games and stuff they have really good ideas they inspire me to think of things in that space and I think you could get the same thing out of it so let me talk I've talked a lot I'm going to tell you and I know I don't do this with video games but I'm going to tell you what I like about board games and what my top five are and I thought about this for a while I realized that the thing I like the most about board games are ones that mix things up every time you play it so you're never quite playing either with the same board or the same deck or the way you interact with players gets mixed up and I like if they offer they don't have to but if they offer collaborative play I really love that and so what I did is I made a list of my top five these are in no particular order but because that was the hard part I realized I was getting stuck trying to order these these are not ordered I think they may literally be in the order I discovered them but they're in no order they're just

 this is what I think would be my top five board games first one is wiz War that's by Tom Jolly I think it's made put out now by chess X Games what I love about whiz war is the board is assembled when you sit down to play it and because the it's it's tiles of dungeons with the walls in different configurations so every time you play it there's a different board you walk around it always is the same objective you either have to get two Treasures onto your home point which is a square in the middle of your starting tile or kill all the other Wizards and you can only carry one treasure once you pick up one treasure you can't pick up another so you have to pick up a treasure go to your hometown drop it and then go get another one so of course while you're off getting it the other Wizards are probably just going to run and grab one off you it's super fun you get cards all your spells are cards that you hold there are spells there are counter spells there are counter counter spells you can summon things it is super fun wildly different every time you play it just as an aside Tom Jolly made a couple other fun games kill Dr lucky is a fun one you're trying to kill someone but no other player can be in line of sight when you do it because you have to do it without anyone knowing then he made a subsequent a sequel to that game called save Dr lucky where you're all on a ship that's sinking and Dr Lucky's moving around and you have to save him but you have to save him within line of sight of at least one other player someone has to see you do it you're basically doing this for the karma so Tom Jolly makes super fun board games like that you should try them out we loved Wiz Wars so much when we I played it I discovered it in late grad school so sometime in the early 90s and then I started playing it in AirPlay we made our own cards for it I think they're even up on the internet somewhere Cosmic Encounter the next game I love is Cosmic Encounter content encounter is is a great game because everybody plays a different alien and I mean different alien there are wildly different aliens in this game and all of them have different crazy alien powers what makes the game so interesting is you're all basically just trying to I think you collect enough bases or something although some aliens have different win conditions and that makes the game really interesting one of them even says that they're allowed to share a base with you and if you and if they're sharing bases with you when you win they win too so there's a reason to be collaborative with them because they'll help you take over star systems but if you win they win and also because they can mix it up and be in different star bases they might win if either people win there may be two people fighting and their win if either of them wins just a crazy game um I messed up one game once because I was playing um someone was playing an alien with a power that was um no I was I was playing the alien with the power I think it was the Oracle if you ask someone a question a yes or no question they have to answer truthfully and I think I looked at someone and said is the answer to this question no and they went yeah but and it it halted the game I was being a jerk um but super fun game um third game I want to talk about is betrayal house on the hill if you haven't played this one I love it it lets you explore haunted house and the rooms are picked from a set of tiles at random so you grow a different house every time but even better is everybody who comes in gets to pick who they want to play and each player has slightly different abilities like how much damage they do when they attack and how fast they move and things like that the cool thing is at one point in the game at some random point it's revealed what's going on and one player is actually the villain or associated with the villain or something they know a lot about what's going on you only find out a little bit until immediately that means everybody else is now collaborating against that Trader that bad guy player I love it because it's collaborative I love it because it's massively different every time you play it different house configuration different explanation for why the house is haunted different players with different stats and each time a different one of them is villainous it's just super fun if you haven't played it you really shouldn't play it my number four game is Settlers Catan I know many of you have probably played this you basically build a game board notice a trend to what I'm saying you build a game board out and then you're building you're exploring you're getting resources you're building towns and Roads you can collaborate with people or not lots of different ways of getting points people win when they have the most number of points love this game played it so very much as my color blindness got worse though there were two sets of game pieces whose colors became the same to me and I literally I could not play in a game if both of those colors were included um I think on my set I may have put magic marker on one so I could tell the difference but still amazing game and then my fifth game and I haven't played this one in a long time it's the Lord of the Rings board game now there's a time that came out this one came out in 2000 by Reiner canizia I think that's his name I loved this game first of all it's collaborative you all play Hobbits it's up to four to five people can play you're all playing Hobbits you're trying to get the ring to mount Mordor or Mount um Doom in Mordor Sauron is an NPC no one plays Sauron every time you do something that involves like the ring like maybe you use it to go and visible or something there's other things too corruption increases and Sauron moves over a little bit as you make progress in the game your Hobbit pieces move over a little bit if Sauron ever catches up to a hobbit that Hobbit's out of the game they stop playing but the rule of the game is the first Hobbit to reach Mount Doom wins the game for all the hobbits even the hobbits that Sauron caught up to so if just one person can win everybody wins and I love that because even though you can't play anymore and I wish there was a mechanic where people could keep playing even if they were caught I love that it makes it more collaborative because sometimes it made sense to sacrifice yourself to let someone else like there was a card once that said if you take two steps back all the other Hobbits can take a step forward sometimes that two steps back would put you right into Sauron but if you did that the other Hobbits have a much better chance of winning if they all move forward so really good game really teaches people to think about being collaborative because there are distinct things you can see advantages to being collaborative so I love that game so those are my top five board games and as you can see I'm really a big fan of board games that don't always play the same have don't have a fixed board don't have a fixed set of cards don't even have a fixed set of rules love those kind of things and I hope these five board games tell you that I really appreciate novel ways of thinking of making board games I love just like Indie video games the board game Space has a lot of original creative thinking in it and I appreciate it and I hope you play some of these games and you

 see what I'm talking about and also I hope that this answers your question Charlie k

Bosses.md

https://youtu.be/RACW99lvJJg?si=-HWZKMHyZBj_BUnH

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim. Today, I want to talk about bosses, and not me even though I'm a boss. Yo, I don't know why I did that. Matthew Bazin asks, "I would like to hear more of your thoughts on bosses and other special NPCs. In other words, how have games handled and how could they handle these enemies in unique and interesting ways?" I think I talked about this a little in a Q&A I did a few months ago, but you know what, let's just do a whole video on it because they're interesting. Bosses are interesting encounters to me. For me, as a designer, a boss is a place where the designer is talking right to the player and going, "Okay, you think you've learned how to play, huh? Well, bring it because we're going to rumble."

Bosses generally, now it's interesting, I didn't plan to use them in The Outer Worlds. In fact, I told Charlie Staples, the lead designer, I said I don't really want to use bosses. We can have varying levels of encounters. I still want the roller coaster experience for that I talked about in the pacing video, but I didn't really want bosses per se. We did end up with some tougher encounters, and we did end the game with a boss, but I'll talk about why we did that in a bit.

So let's talk about bosses in general because bosses are a little different than regular encounters in that they're always hand-placed or almost always. I can't think of a game that has a randomly appearing boss. And the boss themselves is specially designed, and so is their environment. And because of that, even before you meet the boss, the designers should have telegraphed things to you. There should be warnings. NPCs alone should be like, "Oh, don't go in there. You know, there's a Gorgon that will turn you to stone," or "Don't go in there. You know, there's something that breathes poisonous gas," things for you to go, "Hmm, I wonder if I have anything to defend against that kind of thing." Also, and I know you've all played a game where you walk into a room full of heal potions and ammo, and you're like, "Oh," and you can almost hear the designer going, "Watch out." And the first thing you do is save. I've even had rooms like that that auto-save. You walk into a room, and it's auto-save, and you're like, "Uh-oh, I know something's about to go down." That's something that's very boss encounter that you don't see in other encounters. But the main thing I'm saying is, before bosses are even introduced to the player, there's all kinds of things that happen in the game for the player to learn about it, to learn like what kind of boss it is, what might happen when you encounter this boss, so you can prepare and be ready for it. Bosses more than anything, there are really there to test your mettle. You know, have you figured out how to play this game because this is going to be a hard encounter, and you don't want that to be a surprise.

So for now, boss fights are usually fights. Now, we've gotten around that. I mean, Fallout had the encounter with the Master, and this is a spoiler, but guess what, it's a 25-year-old game. The Master, you could literally talk out of fighting you, but you had to have done things before that. You couldn't just have a high speech skill. So yes, some boss encounters aren't always, don't always end in fighting, but let's say 99% of them do, and let's talk about that.

So the first thing you have to think about is how do you handle the non-combat PCs because not every player is going to make a PC with all his points in combat skills. So let's talk about the two major ways around that, and actually three in Outer Worlds. So your stealth character, there's all kinds of things you can do to help a stealth character survive a boss encounter. And one of them is have them use their stealth skills to prepare for the encounter. Maybe there's a room that is locked, and when you go in, they find some special equipment that will debuff the boss, or maybe there's a lever that turns on environmental hazards in the room the boss is in to, you know, to kind of reduce their hit points or something. Something that basically makes the encounter a little easier for the stealth player, and it's a tip of the hat that we know you haven't spent all your points in combat, but you did spend points in stealth. And how do we know that? You're in this room that required lockpick or disarmed trap or sneak. You needed something to get in here.

Similarly, with a dialogue-based character, maybe there's a way in combat to debuff the boss. Maybe there are dialogue skills that debuff them, or maybe you can talk an NPC into coming with you because he's like a well-known Gorgon Hunter, and you're like, "Hey, I'm going in to fight that Gorgon. Why don't you come along?" And they're like, "You have a high speech skill. They're like, okay," and they come along. So now that helps you. They're not just extra hit points and extra damage. If you're a dialogue character, you probably need that help. And then for Outer Worlds, we had the leadership skill, which is you're not necessarily good at talking, but you have, you know, your companions are better. That's what will help you in the boss encounter. Your companions can do their special attacks more frequently. They do more damage. Whatever it is about your leadership skill that improved your companions will certainly come in handy in a boss fight. So those are all the things that happen before you ever encounter the boss, and that's something that's unique to a boss because you know they're coming.

The actual fight with the boss themselves, many people think of bosses, "Oh, they have extra hit points. They have a lot of hit points, and they have a lot of different attack modes." That's true. That's part of it. But I think there's a lot of ways to think about bosses beyond just the boss. For example, the boss might have helpers. The boss might have easier creatures that come along that also attack you. This is great for any of the player abilities that are AOE because it's a chance to use them, and it's a chance to wipe out these things. Often, they are part of a chain, so you do some sweep attack and take out a lot of the helpers, then you do a power attack on the boss. That's a perfect example of abilities that need to power up. I've played games where every time you kill something, it goes into a bar that powers some big ability. So what you do is, when you encounter a boss, is to quickly kill all the little helper creatures, which powers up your big mega ability that you then use on the boss. Also, some games, when they recognize that there are builds that aren't combat-oriented, will let you convert those helpers over to you. Maybe you mind control them. Maybe

 you convince them they're fighting on the wrong side. Whatever you want to do, and suddenly some of those helpers for the boss turn into helpers for you, and they turn on their boss. That's always super fun, and it's memorable, and it uses something your player is made for.

The big thing I mentioned in the Q&A video was bosses should usually go through stages, and that's something that doesn't happen in normal encounters. It happens in boss encounters, where the boss, as they go through different stages, and I know in World of Warcraft, they even tell you this. They sometimes, in like stage two, you know, the boss may physically change. He certainly gains new abilities or movement mode. Suddenly, maybe he's flying, so you have to attack him with ranged, or maybe he suddenly gets an AOE attack weapon. You know, he suddenly can breathe gas or breathe fire. These are all different stages that bosses go through that keep the player on their toes and make them adapt. You can't come in with your one ability and use it because the boss is going to go through stages.

In Temple of Elemental Evil, again, this is going to be spoilers for a 22-year-old game, Zugtmoy at some point would offer to surrender. And depending on your alignment and what you've done previously in the game and what your speech skills are, you can manipulate that. You can either say no and keep fighting, or you can surrender to Zugtmoy, or you can have Zugtmoy surrender to you and become a follower of yours. It's a really cool way, I think, of handling a boss in a way that you rarely see, that it's like you come out of a boss room with the boss, and the boss works for you. We couldn't handle that, unfortunately, in Temple, so that was handled in cutscenes and end slides. But those are the kind of bosses that are super memorable. Everyone's killed the dragon. How many people came out of that mountain riding the dragon and having a new mount, which is the named dragon? That's cool, and that's something you can see. If you haven't seen, that's something people should do.

Also, because bosses tend to be placed, like I said, I don't think of a lot of randomly encountered bosses. The room itself can go through stages, and that's something I've seen in different games where the room itself changes over time. Maybe there are hazards. Maybe they're not there, and they start up, or maybe they're there, but they move. Maybe they're there, and they change type. They go from being electrical to acid, and that's again something to keep the player on their toes, to make them have to adapt to that new change. Also, sometimes blockers appear, like columns will rise up, or shields will appear, and you have to deal with it. You have to knock them down, or you have to move position, or you just have to change your tactics. Also, paths to things that can help you or hurt the boss can suddenly appear. Maybe all of a sudden, these columns shoot up, and at the top of them are levers that can spray acid on the boss, but you have to double jump to get there. Players who never took double jump are like, "I guess I just keep fighting the boss," but all the double jump players are like, "Woohoo, I'm spraying acid." That's cool.

And then, I already kind of touched on it with you leaving with the boss. There's a lot of things that make boss encounters memorable that happen after you're done. They're post-boss things because people want some kind of change beyond just a base reward, like here's a plus one sword, and here's a bunch of coins or something. They want something that's like, "I took on a boss." Maybe it's a reputation. Maybe you're known as the Gorgon Slayer, and now there's a new greeting people have when you walk around the world. That's really cool. Maybe you get a special item from them that gets reactions from people. In Arcanum, we had armor that made people do a special greeting, and they could tag the armor. The armor basically looked so scary that you would get a different greeting out of people you meet in towns. We really wanted that. We put that in planning to use it on boss encounters. There might even be a world state change. Maybe this entire zone was foggy or stormy, and then when you kill the boss and come out, it's not that way anymore, and people are going, "Yay, go you." Or like I said, you know, the only way to get a named dragon mount is to go kill a boss dragon or almost kill, and then they surrender, and they become your mount. These are all things that a boss can provide that is really especially cool because it's a boss. It wasn't just something that randomly dropped. It's something that you went in with the intention of getting, and once you get, people know what you did. So it kind of changes the world state. That's something that's really cool and special and almost unique, eh, let's not say unique, it's something that's very associated with bosses.

So that's my idea on bosses, the pre, during, and post-boss experience, and why I think those are different than regular encounters, and how I think you can step up your boss game by including more of these things in your boss design. So, I hope that helped, Matthew.

Brainstorming.md

https://youtu.be/9lYuzefVvMA?si=AepO9UW4SXU1fl_T

Hi everyone, it's me Tim. Today I want to talk about brainstorming—basically my thoughts on it, how we did it, what worked, what didn't.

So, basically, when I talk about brainstorming, I'm usually talking about a meeting where we get together and I explicitly tell people it's a brainstorming session. We get together to chew on ideas, and this is specifically something that you want to do in a group. I mean, I tell people ahead of time we're chewing on ideas with each other, where we're gonna go over these. I always tell people ahead of time, be positive, let's examine all of them for their pros and cons.

I like it because you can really take an idea and you can pull it apart, you can see the pieces of it, think about how it will work with other systems in the game, and put it back together, sometimes in a slightly different way.

What I've discovered over the years is that some people are really, really bad at collaborative design. I don't know what it is. I think they miss the collaboration part. Over the years, I've categorized them as one of three different types of people. The first type, they just critique all the ideas in the session, with the possible exception of theirs, as dumb or stupid or nobody wants to have in their game. It's remarkably unconstructive. I've often said to people, you might as well not even say anything because when you offer an unconstructive criticism, what is anyone supposed to do with that? There's nothing to do. It's literally unactionable, so why are you even talking?

Sometimes that fixes it. Sometimes people are like, "Oh, okay, I didn't realize I was being so negative." Sometimes they just go, "Okay, okay," and then they go right on doing it. And I try to tell them what we want you to say is, "Instead, try saying, 'Well, I hear what your idea is, and I think it would lead to this problem, or it would lead to this issue. Do we want this issue in the game? Maybe we don't mind, or if we don't, what do we do to fix it?'" That's a lot more useful than just getting, "That's dumb."

The second type of people I often run into in these meetings are people who come in with their own idea, and that's the only thing they're gonna want, the only thing they listen to. They defend it against all commentary, all critique. They won't acknowledge there are any flaws in it. Their idea is perfect, and they want to do it, and they don't listen to anyone else's ideas, which again makes me go, "Why did you come to a brainstorming session if you don't want to brainstorm ideas?"

And you just have to be open for someone else having a better idea. I mean, hello, I was going to call the Fallout system "slips," and then Jason Swin went, "You know, SPECIAL." So you just have to be open that someone there may have a better idea than yours, and some people just can't move past that.

And then finally, there are people who show up, who don't have any ideas on their own and don't comment on anyone's ideas. And I don't mind this. I mean, I talked about the quiet powerhouses I've worked with, and some of them are fantastic; they do great work. But I question, why did you come to a brainstorming meeting? And sometimes I go, "Well, I just like hearing the ideas." Okay, but you can hear about them later. It's especially when the brainstorming session gets too large; it's hard for people to feel like they can contribute. But if there's 15 people and only five of them are talking, I want to ask the other 10, "Why did you come?" And frequently, somebody says, "Well, I would have said something, but everyone else talked a lot." You know, I try to go around and ask people what they want, and there are lulls, and there's drops in the conversation, and you're here to present an idea. I can't do all that work for you. So I've had that kind of person, and hopefully, you can just move past that.

So, I did a lot of brainstorming sessions at every company I worked at, except maybe Pegasus. I don't think people want 16-year-olds to run their brainstorming sessions. We did a lot at Interplay, in Troika, a lot. Fallout did this great, and this is where I say I didn't really learn why until later, but we were all real passionate. We all wanted to contribute. We're all willing to listen to each other, and we just all wanted to make a good game, and we were all headed in the same direction. That unity of vision, Troika did it too, mostly. We weren't as successful as Fallout. It took me years to figure this out. In fact, I know people hate me saying this, but I'll probably do a video about some of the issues that happened at Troika that surprised me because they didn't happen on Fallout at Interplay. But we pretty much know had good brainstorming sessions at Troika.

Carbine is where I saw things really just go south. People would show up at these meetings absolutely entrenched. They already brought their idea, and they weren't going to listen to anyone else, or they didn't bring an idea, but they got mad, like, "Why is this meeting taking so long?" And I'm like, often I'd be like, "Why are you here?" And then they go back to their office and tell everyone, "Tim didn't even want me here. I think he doesn't like [insert artist, programmer, Junior QA, whatever]." And it was just like, no, you, if you're going to come to a meeting and not contribute, if you're going to come to a group roundtable meeting like that and not contribute, that's on you. There's only so much I can do to help you in a meeting like that. You have to meet me halfway, and there are a lot of people at Carbine who didn't want to do that. They were like, "Either I came with an idea and I said it, and why didn't everyone recognize its obvious greatness? Or I'm not going to talk, and afterwards, I'm gonna be really angry."

Obsidian was interesting because I was there from 2011 to 2020, and I'm still doing design there now, but remotely. So I was there for nine years as an employee who was physically working there. Early on, for like South Park and Pillars and Tyranny, I thought it went pretty good with the brainstorming, but later, when I was game director, it was hard to get people to brainstorm. I literally had one person who I'd worked with closely on those other games say, "Yeah, I just can't do it. I mean, you're Game Director now. I can't do it. I can't argue one of your ideas. I just, you say it, I just want to implement it." And that was a little frustrating. Leonard would do it. Charlie would do it. Other people wouldn't. Ferg

 occasionally would, but then he had the habit, and he did this way back at Interplay, where if he lost one of those—if he lost, and I don't consider it a competition, but if there was a brainstorming session and his idea didn't come out on top, he sometimes just put it in anyway. That was the turbo plasma rifle in Fallout. He did it in Outer Worlds with a few things, a few of which broke the game build the next day. So there's that. I would call that a fourth type of person, but that was a special case.

I do know that sometimes when Leonard and I would hash out ideas, especially on Outer Worlds, because we'd worked together for a long time, and we knew we could talk to each other about stuff, we'd get really passionate. Sometimes one person would be standing up in front of the whiteboard, and the other person would be like, "Ah, blah, blah, blah." And one time, Anthony Davis, one of the programmers there, he came by and he tiptoed into the room, and he goes, "Why are you guys yelling? It's making everybody tense. It's like Mom and Dad are arguing." And I said, "Look, look, I'm gonna stop you right there. But, um, which one of us is Mom in this case?" And also, I tried to tell them we were just, we were just hashing out ideas. We weren't mad at each other. We weren't arguing. And it made me realize that some people at Obsidian had never seen that happen, that two people or more can really chew on an idea and try to hash it out, and they're not angry. They're just—it makes me wonder if people never really saw real passion for game design, or if they thought that was a bad thing. All I know is that's how Leonard and I often worked through ideas, and I liked it.

When you brainstorm, though, you have to be willing to admit you're wrong, or, you know, similar to that, you have to be willing to admit that someone else's idea is better than yours, and that's hard for some people to do. I love it when people come up with an idea about their mind for a couple reasons. One, hey, the game has a brand-new idea that's better, and two, now they can own it. They can be the one who can go, "Okay, I thought of this idea. I'll spec it out, you know. I'll be the point person for when people have questions about this idea." And I think that works for a number of reasons. One, they're super happy, you know, because they have a new idea that's in the game, and it's theirs, and they can own it. But also, it makes them feel like they're owning the game. People who have ideas that directly get implemented tend to be way more into the game they're working on. And so that's why I'm really happy when people come up with a better idea because I'm like, "Yeah, let's do yours."

Now, there are occasions where in hindsight, I kind of wish things had gone differently, and I realized we had implemented different things. And you know what? That's okay. I don't think there's a single game of mine that's ever shipped, and I look back and go, "Hmm, we did everything right." I often wish that we had made different decisions. Sometimes you get to a point where it's too late; you've made that decision, too much work has been done on it. It's not horrible; it's just you have a better idea now, and that's okay. I think you should be like that. That's how you learn; that's how you improve. What you really need to be scared about is people who are always right, people whose ideas are always right, who can't think of anything they'd do better in one of their games, who think everything they do is wonderful. Those are the scary people.

So, anyway, those are all my ideas on brainstorming, and I hope that gave you a little look and kind of how brainstorming worked when we made the RPGs that we did, and maybe it can help you on your brainstorming session.
Title: 
Bugs In RPGs

Youtube Link:
https://youtu.be/8Kc1XoHpHEA?si=rei_rAzXIlxXDQuX

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim, and today I want to talk about bugs, and particularly bugs in RPGs. My experience is all in RPGs, so I'm sure a lot of what I'm saying will generalize, but I just want to talk about why RPGs tend to be buggy. This actually comes from a question a lot of people had questions this is when I picked. rrams1989 asked, "Will all RPG games always be very buggy on release? What's the main reason for this?" I will break that into two sections.

Will they always be buggy? Yes, they always have been buggy. Um, despite what a lot of people may say or remember, RPGs have always been buggy. Games have always been buggy. Yes, especially console games, especially when they were done on um cartridges and media that could not be updated. They were heavily QA'd and, in many cases, heavily simplified to make sure that there weren't as many bugs, but there were always bugs, and there always will be bugs. And going forward, I think the situation will probably be worse, or at least about the same, and there's a bunch of reasons for that.

Remember, I'm talking from experience as someone who has shipped games with a lot of bugs. However, The Outer Worlds didn't have many very many bugs at all, relative to other Obsidian games and my own games, so it is possible to ship a game with less bugs. I don't believe you can ship a game with no bugs.

So let's talk about that. Remember, I'm talking about RPGs. RPGs are really complicated pieces of software. They are extraordinarily complex and made of many interlocking pieces. So, unlike a and I'm not belittling these games, I'm just doing a comparison, unlike a game like Street Fighter, where you may have, what, a dozen characters that can fight, and they each have a few moves and a few animations. They have no inventory, they have no quest history, they have no leveling. That game is inherently simpler to make.

Now, it has stuff that's way more complicated. Because of that, people expect more from the animation, people expect more fluidity of combat than you might get at an RPG, but there are fewer pieces to it. So those developers deep dive on those fewer pieces that they have.

Now, in a lot of RPGs, especially nonlinear ones, that nonlinearity, or just the fact fact that the player can choose to do different things at different times, leads to blocking conditions. Um, this is very much a programming way of looking at it. Once you have multiple solutions to things, to quests, to problems, to puzzles, this necessarily means you will now have multiple bugs. You will have multiple items being used for those solutions, multiple skills, multiple character builds, so you have a lot more opportunity for bugs.

Also, emergent gameplay leads to something. Now, I love emergent gameplay. I have a whole video about emergent gameplay, but emergent gameplay leads to something called emergent bugs. You have ways of using skills and items and environmental things like hazards or doors or chests. You have ways of, if you have ways of interacting with them that the designers didn't intend, that emerge from the rules that were created, this will lead to bugs. This will lead to interactions with those items that weren't planned and do the wrong thing under the rules that were made. Those are really hard to track down. Those are really hard to anticipate. I would argue, as games become more complex, they're almost impossible to anticipate. You simply have to try to catch them after you make the game.

Now, like I said, simpler games don't have all of these, but they do have some of these. There are things that are just really hard to make sure that you catch every possible way something could be used, every possible way somebody did key presses or moved the controller or interacted with something while using something else, or under a condition having a status effect on them. How multiple status effects interact, these are all things that can happen in the simplest of games that make them really complicated to try to test.

Now, somebody else asked on a different question, "Well, how do you even rate bugs when you're making a game, and you know there are bugs in there? How do you rate them?" Because you have to rate them somehow. You have to acknowledge at some point, beyond the most simplest game, you are going to have probably more bugs on your bug queue than you'll ever be able to reach. And some of you going, "Well, some of them are minor." Well, how do you rate them? What's the difference between a major bug and a minor bug?

And I will tell you how I rated them on my RPGs. So the highest rated bugs, the ones you did not want to ship with, and when you saw them arise in testing, were ranked the highest in the cue of things that need to be fixed: crash bugs, number one. You do not want people crashing because not only is that horrible for the player because they lose all their progress, but it's, it shows an underlying instability that will make people unwilling to keep playing because if it happens multiple times, or if it happened after they lo, they hadn't saved for a while, or if it tends to happen when certain things occur, and suddenly they realize, "Oh my goodness, my build is causing crash bugs," they just stop playing. So crashing is probably the number one reason people rage quit a game.

My other highest rated ones for my games are things like, you've made a build that you discovered cannot complete the game. Either you don't have the skills that are needed, or this build tends to get a set of quests that can't be done, or this build can't acquire all the things that are needed to complete the game, for whatever reasons. That's horrible too, because the player isn't responsible for this, and there was no to anticipate it, suddenly they find, after 5, 10, 50 hours, yeah, the character they're playing can't finish this game. That is so draining to have that happen.

And then that's, so that's the second um kind of bug that I rate the highest. The third one that I give the highest rating are things that would prevent the game from being certified. Windows and all the consoles have certain things that you need to do to make sure they get certified, and if you don't pass any of those, they won't let your game ship. This can be anything from you're not connecting to their Achievement System, or um, you can't quit out of the game at any point, or you have put in content that don't meet, meet the rating that you said your game was for. So you put in some mature content but you ask for a teen rating. These are all things will prevent your game from being certified, and if you're not certified, you're not shipping on that platform. So those, those three things: crashes, um, not being able to be completed, and not being able to be certified, those are the three highest kind of bugs that you look for and go, "These have to be fixed."

Now you may have a lot of those, which is part of the reason these lower tiers may not all be cleared out before the game ships. So the next

 tier down would be finding things that were incorrectly implemented. So you're playing the game, and you're like, "O, this skill isn't working the way the design doc says it should," or, um, "I thought this item was supposed to be able to do this, and it's not doing that," and that will prevent something from working, or now this item isn't seen as very good when actually it should have been one of the best ones in the game. So then you have to go back and say, "Hey, implementor, you need to fix this."

But there's a flip side of what can happen, and that is something was correctly implemented, but it's causing an issue that wasn't anticipated. Maybe it's interacting badly with an environmental item. Maybe it's interacting with other items. So maybe two items were put in, individually those items are fine, but together they cause a problem. Maybe things don't stack correctly, or maybe they stack and cause a bug or whatever, and then you have to decide what to do. Do you, because the implementation is what was on paper, do you delete that item or that feature?

If it's a feature, it make it may, deleting it itself may cause ramifications. "Oh no, we can't take out all of crafting because crafting was considered when we made our item economy. So not having a crafting channel to get items into the game means that there are level ranges in the game where you can't get good items, or you can't get the best item because it's no longer available because you took out crafting." So sometimes, deleting things from a game causes a lot more work than leaving it in and fixing the thing that's broken.

So those two things, either incorrectly implemented things or things that are correctly implemented and now causing issues, are probably the next tier. And then the lower tier ones are things like, "This isn't fun." We did this, we put this thing in, people are playing it, and they say it's not fun. Maybe you have a class that isn't fun, maybe you have a dungeon that isn't fun, maybe you have a skill that no one ever takes cuz it's not fun. Not that it doesn't work, not that it doesn't have some utility, it's just not fun, so people aren't playing it.

We also look for areas of the game that aren't clear. Maybe when we looked at our telemetry of play testers, we found that people tended to stop playing at a certain point. Maybe it's not clear how you're supposed to advance the main quest line, maybe it's not clear how you're supposed to get that important item, maybe it's not clear who you're supposed to talk to next. Those are things that we look for and go, "Okay, we need to clarify things," which may require writing new dialogue, um, changing the way quest markers work. It can be a wide range of solutions to that problem, and that's why you end up having to talk about it and try to figure out what solution can we implement with the time and resources we have left.

And then the final one, I was, I didn't know how to talk, how to classify it, but I call it sanding off friction. You look for things in the game that are just causing people to be frustrated. Maybe drop rates aren't high enough, maybe they're NPCs that are just super annoying to interact with. They were written to have character. I've talked about this, if, if this main NPC, his personality is entirely being sarcastic, maybe a lot of players are just like, "Uh, I hate talking to that guy." So I call this sanding off friction. These are bugs that are put in where people just don't like it, it's, it's just something you got to fix.

So those are low priority because, like I said, I'd rather fix a crash bug or an incorrectly implemented feature before I start sanding off friction. But if you've ever shipped a game with a lot of friction, which I have, people don't like that either. Um, now I know a lot of people are thinking, but it's gotten worse lately because people ship games that aren't even look like they're even trying to be done, and yes, everything I just said is true for games from day one in the industry and games being shipped now.

One thing that makes all this worse is when publishers or anybody who has the money basically goes, "We'll just patch it later. Let's ship it, and we'll patch it later." That wasn't an option back in the day where you burned it onto a cartridge that couldn't be fixed, or you shipped a game for console where you played it by popping in a CD. There was no hard drive, so those couldn't be fixed. So you had to ship it as close to possible. Now people are like, "I don't want to keep spending money. Let's ship it, make some money, and then use that money to try to fix these bugs."

Also, if you're kickstarted or self-funded, you may just run out of fund. There may be no money to go in and say, "O, we need to fix this." You're literally done. You can't pay people, so unless they want to work for free, you're shipping what you got, or you're just throwing it all away. If you just literally think that this will be so awful that it will ruin your reputation, you just throw it away. There's a lot of games out there that you've never heard of, that you'll never play because they were canceled before they even hit a part where the company would mention that the game existed.

So yes, patching, patching things post-release has made this problem worse, but it didn't create this problem. So probably everyone now is going, "Well, how do we stop this? How do we prevent this from happening?" It's complicated, but I have a few things I thought of, a few ways of doing it. Basically three ways of doing it.

One, start QA, start play testing early. As soon as the game is playable, maybe as soon as you made that first playable, but certainly by the time you've made a vertical slice, try to have a QA, a playtest group playing it. Now, you have to make sure these play testers are aware of the state because there's nothing more soul-draining for a developer to say, "Hey, I'm giving you a gray box level. Can you tell me if you feel the mechanics are good?" and all your feedback is, "It's ugly. I hate it. I don't like this. It looks stupid. Why are you making this?" It's, it's frustrating to have play testers who don't understand the stage of play testing. Not everything is in its final form when you get it, and you have to understand that before you start play testing it.

The second way of getting better bugs, I think, is having in-house QA. I've always had far more luck with people I can go and talk to than people who are not only not at the company but maybe not even in this timezone. So I've got to come in at 6:00 a.m. if I want to talk to them, or I've got to stay till 11:00 p.m. because they're literally

 on the other side of the planet. Having in-house QA means they can access design docs, and since we do are design docs now up, say on Confluence or something, that are living design docs, changing design docs, they can have access to the most recent design doc. So when they're playing the game, they're like, "That's a weird skill," they can go look and see exactly what is intended for that skill to behave. So they can, they can write a bug confident that, "Hey, this isn't working the way it's supposed to."

The other thing I love about Nas QA, I started doing this back in Fallout, and I loved doing it. I couldn't do it in everything for at Troika, but I wanted to, is a weekly meeting with the QA lead. I like to do this as early as I can, probably past the first test playables, but at some point, I started having weekly meetings. And part of that weekly meeting was just having him tell me, "What are the worst bugs you've seen? Why do you think these are so bad? If I can't tell, like, this bug doesn't seem important. Why is it on your top 10 list this week? What do you feel about the game?" How does it feel? That no one will play your game more than QA. They sink so many hours into your game. Ask them how it feels, get, get opinions. And a good QA lead will not just tell you how he feels, but he will have talked to the people on the team and go, "Well, the action people are loving it, but the story people, not so much." This is really valuable advice to be getting from your in-house QA Department. If you're not getting that, I feel sorry for you. We got that for Outer Worlds, and I think it's showed in the final product because it was very, very stable and not bug-free but didn't have a lot of bugs.

So that's a second way in-house QA helps. And then the final one is having test plans. So you, as a designer, should be able to describe how your features should be tested. Here's a skill for lockpicking. "Hey, I want you to lockpick a door, but also do chests, also use it on, you know, maybe there's unusual things that can be locked. Like occasionally, um, you know, a dead body will have a something that you have to pick, or maybe it also works on computers. Who knows? Just write down those test plans, and then make sure they're followed." I've already told stories in other videos about on my D&D game, QA didn't really test bards. They didn't like them. And on my Vampire game, they didn't test Nosferatu cuz they were ugly. I'm not saying they didn't test them at all, but they barely tested them. There were some really, really obvious bugs that we shipped with with those characters, um, that they, they just didn't follow the test plan. So you have to have a test plan, and you have to know it's being followed.

One thing that helped being followed, that weekly meeting with your QA lead. Now, what is all, how can I wrap all this up? Everything I just described takes money. You want to test early? Money. You want to have QA in-house? Money. You want to have test plans and make sure they're being followed? Money. Because that's, a time your designers will be spending not designing, but instead writing test plans for their design. That's times where QA people won't be playing, they'll be looking at the test plans and planning how they're going to play. Then you're going to have be meetings about whether you met those test plans. That's all time. Time is money. Money, money, money.

So ultimately, I could have gotten rid of this entire video and just said, "Why do games have bugs? Money." Will we always see games with bugs? Yes, because of money. As long as money is not infinite, you will probably see bugs. Because unless the game is made so narrow in scope that they could test every possibility in it, I hope this gives you some insight into why you should expect bugs in games, and I hope rrams1989, this answered your question.

Building Tools.md
Youtube Link:
https://youtu.be/_P4-2Nv_Or8?si=diyaR5PXK3OHoieX

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim, and today I want to talk about building tools. Shady Desperado 2590 asks, "I have a lot of questions about building tools for other developers and teammates. What's that process like? What do the various tools look like for different departments? What problems can they cause, and how can they be avoided?" That is a set of good questions. I will try to answer them here. You're asking a lot of different questions at once, but I think I can answer them both at a high level and by using examples of games I worked on where I didn't work on the tools and then games I worked on where I did and what I learned from that.

So, let me start with like two really high-level things that I think are super important for anybody on a team, but especially whoever's making the tools. The first one is, you should know other disciplines besides your own. I've said this in other videos about how I like working better with designers who can code because they often lead to making designs that are codable, where occasionally you will have a designer put features in their game that are either really hard to code, or really hard to code efficiently, or just a mess to code, or with a slight change to the design, it's really easy to code, really easy to keep debug, and delivers the same experience to the player. I've said that about learning to code for artists. If artists know how their models are actually being rendered in the game, they can often make art that is faster or looks better than if they have no idea what happens when it leaves their computer. This is true for programmers as well. I found that when programmers know how assets are being made in the game, they make way better tools. In fact, they make way better code. Graphics programmers who know how models are textured, rigged, and animated make better tools for that. The same way that once a scene is put together and they're required to write some pixel shaders, understanding stuff about how the art the scene is done in art really informs the pixel shaders they're going to make. So, because of that, I always feel like people should be not super generalists but at least attempt to be cross-disciplinary, understand things from other disciplines, even if you're not good at doing it. I'm terrible at art, but I tried to understand it. I don't script frequently, but I dug deep into it. I did write dialogues, and I wrote them poorly, but I learned how to write better dialogue tools, both from trying to write dialogue and from looking at the dialogues that other people wrote.

Which leads me to the second thing that I think is important for anyone making a tool, which is, I've heard it called "eat your own dog food." I'm sure if you've used any of the popular game engines, let's not name them, but if you've used them, you know what I'm about to say. You'll often be using those game engines to do something for your game, whether you're making a UI or scripting or putting in lots of data for lots of different similar game objects, and at one point, you have to stop and just go, "Did anybody at that company actually make a commercial level game with this?" because this process is agonizing. Sometimes, even on the biggest game engines, I've been led to believe by using the engine that they may have made a simple demo or a demonstration of how to do that feature, but they've never actually made a commercial game with it, because once you make a hundred different interfaces or thousands of objects, and you're trying to fix things that are common to all of them or search them for some particular element you use, and you discover you just really can't do that, it makes you go, "Yeah, these people never used this. They never did anything with this."

So, once we get past that, I'm going to assume you're attempting to learn the discipline of the tool you're making, and that you actually use the tool. Those two things, you could ignore everything else I say here, and those two things will go a far way, a long way to you making a great tool. But now, let me talk about some experiences I had on making tools. I'll talk about, let me talk about going from Fallout to Arcanum. Now, if you know the history of that, Fallout was made at Interplay, and so when a few of us left and we were all going to just get a job somewhere, and we decided to make a company instead, we had to remake all the tools. 

Now, during the making of Fallout, I didn't make a single level, nor did I even make WorldEd, the editor for putting together maps. However, during the making of the game, I heard a lot of people complain about things that those editors made difficult. For example, the way people had to put together the isometric maps is, you had to, the art got cut up into slices of walls and tiles, but there was no indication of how they would go together. So, whoever's making the map had to grab a tile and then look on a little strip at the bottom, look and grab a tile, and see if it connected, and sometimes they look like they would, but then you put them next to each other, and the pixels don't match up, and you have to do it again and again and again. Similarly, with the walls, you put down one wall, and you go put up another, and you're like, "Oh, that doesn't quite fit. Let me go find another wall strip." That took a lot of time and made making maps that should have been pretty simple and straightforward take hours or days instead of seconds or minutes. So, when I made the world editor for Arcanum, I made it so that you could spray down tiles of any type—water, shallow water, deep water, sand, grass, rock, anything you wanted—and it would automatically do several things. It would transition it to connect correctly to all the tiles around it, and it would select random variations on those tiles, and if you didn't like them, you could always click and redo it. But it made making, first of all, the base of the map trivial and fast. Wanted to do the same things for buildings, so we made a top-down view that you could just draw a rectangle, and it would insert all the walls, corners, everything, and then when you went back to isometric, there were all the wall strips done correctly, and it would put a roof on it because it was part of a wall, roof, window, door set that the artist could put together. If you wanted to make a window, there was a key you could press and just click on a wall segment, and it would put a window there. If you put a window right next to it, it would just make a longer window, so you could make bigger windows and smaller windows very easily. Same thing with doors, or I should say, doorways. You could click and put a door doorway and plop a door in it. You could widen it by putting a door right next to it. You could change out what kind of door was used there. Very easy, very fast.

Similarly, I didn't make the scripting language, or the editor, or even script in

 Fallout, but wow, did I fix a lot of bugs related to scripts. So again, when we started Arcanum, before we even wrote one script, or even anybody thought about it, I already designed out Sock Monke Script Maker, which I've shown in another video. It was the Arcanum scripting editor and scripting language. They worked highly, highly constrained. You could not, first of all, you could not write a syntactically incorrect Sock Monkey script, because you didn't actually write anything. You selected from dropdown menus the actions and conditionals you wanted to check. It was very difficult to make infinite loops, although I underestimated the tenacity of some scriptwriters to create bugs, and there were ways by using multiple scripts to create infinite loops, but even then, I put in a simple script call counter and eventually managed to prevent them from crashing the game. But what this meant was people could script just as fast, if not faster, in Sock Monkey than in Fallout, but their scripts were unlikely to have as many bugs in them, and if they were, they were purely semantic bugs. They were bugs in not doing what they were supposed to do. They weren't bugs in referencing a bad object, or having a syntax error, or having an infinite loop. So that saved us a lot of time in Arcanum, both time on the frontend creating all those scripts and time on the backend debugging them.

Similarly, I didn't write any of the dialogues in Fallout, and very few of them in Arcanum, but again, I saw a lot of bugs in Fallout's dialogue. And in addition to bugs, I saw a lot of memory wastage. I saw a lot of strings being reused, or almost being reused. So, there were so many places in Fallout where you would ask, you would try to bribe someone, but it was all written in different ways, which meant all these strings had to be stored, which used up memory, they had to be loaded, which was time, they had to be translated, which was time and money. So, that just made me go, "Oh." So, this is what led to me writing generated dialogue for Arcanum, which is another video you can go see. I'll put links to these in the bottom, and I promise I will remember to put those links in. But generated dialogue in Arcanum meant it was easy to throw in a quick bribe subtree, vendor vending subtree, insult subtree, ask for help subtree, ask about the story state subtree—all the ones I mentioned in there were easy to put in. There were variations that they could write and put in one place, so they didn't always say the same thing, but you could control how much variation there was, which let you get some control over the localization costs. And believe me, these are things that let Arcanum, which is a much, much bigger game than Fallout, be made in the exact same amount of time, with about a third as many people. So, that was all tools. I put that all on tools.

So again, let me just sum up how to build a good tool: know who will use the tool and how they will use it, and if that means using it yourself, great. Then, build a tool that lets them do the common things they do very easily and quickly because those are the things that are done most often. Those should be the fastest things to do. Also, try to make the tool so it reduces the amount of mistakes they could possibly make, so it could reduce how much memory they use and any other issues you can try to build into the tool to steer people away from doing bad things. They will still find ways of doing bad things, people are people, but if you can do this, if you can know how the tool be used, make the common stuff fast and easy, and the buggy stuff or memory hoggy stuff hard, you will go a long way to not only having a tool that people like using but a tool that saves you time and money making your game.

I hope that answers your question, Shady Desperado, and I hope for everyone else, it makes them rethink how much effort they're putting into their tools because a little effort on the tools saves you a lot more effort later on.
Title:
Canonical Endings

Youtube Link:
https://youtu.be/V6rDgA5NXQc?si=umnmdSC_ZS4qCOXw

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim. Today, I want to talk about canonical endings and by canonical endings, I mean the ending of a game that is considered to be the right ending, or the correct ending, or the true ending, or at the very minimum, the ending the developer expected you to have. Now, for nonlinear role-playing games that there's only one ending, everybody has the exact same experience and then experiences the one ending that there is, and that's the canonical ending. But for a lot of my games, which were nonlinear, multiple ending, very choice, and consequence-based games, finding the canonical story ending can be tough.

I know when we were making Fallout, the person who was working on the guide, the play guide, kept asking us, "Well, what's the player supposed to do? How's this section supposed to be done?" And we didn't have an answer for him. We said, "Well, it really depends on what the player decides to do and what kind of character he's playing and what he happens to choose to do in that moment." So, it was hard. If it was hard to write just a walkthrough of the game, you could imagine what they did when they got to the ending and they're like, "Well, how's it supposed to end?"

Now, the reason you need to come up with a canonical story ending is because if you're making a sequel, you kind of need to have a jumping-off place. Now, bear in mind, I've only made one sequel so far in my career, and that was Fallout 2. So, I'm going to talk about four different ways you can pick a canonical ending or indicate which ending you think is canonical if you're making a sequel. Bear in mind, I've only done this once, so I'm going to start with the one we did for that.

So, the first technique is to look for the commonalities in all the endings and just assume those commonalities and nothing else. For Fallout 2, that's what we ended up doing. We knew the player had survived, we knew the master and the Army had been destroyed, and we knew the player was kicked out of the Vault. So, given those elements and nothing else because a lot of other things could have been very different—what happened to all the different townships, who lived and who didn't—we assumed for Fallout 2 just those three things and then jumped forward. Now, we did assume Tandy had lived because we made her the head of the NCR, so I guess we did one other thing besides that. But the when we moved forward, we basically said, "Let's not reference too many things that the player did, just reference things that the player probably in area the player probably moved through and had some interaction with." So, that's one way you can look at what the commonalities of all the endings are and make that commonality your canonical ending.

Another way you can do it is just to pick one and say, "That was the canonical one." For Arcanum 2, we said, "Well, we're just going to assume the player defeated Kyan, and we're going to assume at some point they had learned about Franklin Payne, the great explorer, and then from those two things, we're just going to say, okay, we're going to make Arcanum 2 based on that kind of ending."

For one, when I was working on Temple of Elemental Evil, and I know I mentioned this before, I had grandiose plans for that. I wanted Temple to move into Against the Giants, the G1, 2, and 3 Series, and then I wanted to go into The Descent Into the Depths, the D series, and finally Queen of the Demon Web Pits, the Q Series, which is now called the AD&Q mega module. I wanted to do that. So, for temple 2, going into Against the Giants, we were going to assume the good ending for temple, the one where you went down to the bottom of the temple, encountered Zugtmoy, fought her, and banished her. You didn't join her, you didn't let her join you, you didn't become the ultimate Evil yourself. We kind of assume the good ending where she was banished, and that's how we're going to start temple 2. So, that's the second way, just pick one of your endings and say, "That's the canonical one."

The third way is to let the player pick what ending they want to call the canonical one. You can do this in a lot of ways: you can ask questions about what the player did or would have done had they played through the story, and then base your new sequel storyline based on that. That's what they did for Witcher 3, and that's a really interesting way of doing it. I mean, it lets the player select different things each time they replay the game and see how their starting situation would be different. In a way, it's a really cool way of doing end slides, but not until you buy the next game, and not with end slides that you basically pick the conditions, and then boom, that's what the world starts like for you. So, I like that, never did that.

And then, the fourth way of doing canonical endings is to let the player produce a save game from the previous game, and the new game looks at all the tracking variables because that save game is going to be full of all the tracking variables it's keeping for achievements, for end slides, for NPC reaction, and from there, see what the player actually did and base the subsequent game on that. I think the Mass Effects did that, which is a pretty cool way of doing it. I've never done that either.

So, those are all the four ways I can think of doing it, which is of all your endings, pick a common the commonalities or just say one is canonical, or let the player pick one that's canonical, or let the player have his old save game be scanned, and you start the sequel based on that. I can't think of another way of handling canonical endings, but since I really didn't do a lot of sequels, I didn't really have to think about it. But a lot of people have been asking what I think about canonical endings, and I think that's all my thoughts on the matter. So, I hope that answers questions about how I would select the one best right ending to one of my games.

Carbine Redux.md

https://youtu.be/1NtaWFyo1ps?si=KPNN_IFL43UM5c6L

Hi everyone, it's me Tim. Today I want to talk a little more about Carbine because that video generated a lot of comments. I'm not gonna answer all the questions, but I do want to go over a lot of the topics that came up. Also, I don't have another Carbine shirt, so we're back to Fallout.

First of all, I want to talk about the fact that I tried in that video to stick as closely as I could to events, like things that happened that I documented that happen. I like to stick to events because people have wildly different interpretations of even events. You know, the same thing can happen, and everybody interprets the causes of it and who's to blame and whatever differently. I mean, can you imagine what it'd be like if I talked about so-and-so being angry or whatever their internal mental or emotional states were? It would just the interpretation of that that's my interpretation of it, and then your interpretation of my interpretation. So, I try to just stick to on these dates, this person did something, said something, emailed something, something I wrote down.

But there's another reason I don't like to talk about why people did things, and that's because one, I'm not good at it. I have no idea half the time why people are doing the things they do. It seems a lot of things they do seem counter to their own productivity or the how good the game is going to be, or even, you know, them being happy. I really don't understand sometimes why people do what they do. But the other reason I don't like doing it is a lot of people lie about why they're doing things, and not just to other people. A lot of people lie to themselves while they're doing something. You know, you see this a lot of people go, "Look, I'm just being honest." No, you're really being mean, or they think that they're doing something because they're, you know, this is the this is important for the game, and it's like, no, the game would be fine without this, you just want it. And it's fine to say you want something, but it's weird to say, "This is, you know, this is the only way we're going to support this design pillar of the game is this one design of mine, so that's why I'm pushing it beyond everyone else's designs." So, and sometimes they even believe that. So, I just try not to say why people do what they do.

And then I know at least one person who worked at Carbine who commented on my video talked about all the secrecy that was there. And while I agree, and as a director, you know, with a lot of meetings they weren't privy to, but I saw a lot of other meetings happen that I wasn't in. All I can tell you is first of all, I was literally not allowed to just go talk to artists. I mean, this is something that you know, the art director said in a director meeting, and the studio had backed them up. I wasn't allowed to go down and talk to artists. The artist who came to show me double jump, who by the way, wasn't he didn't say he made it, he just said, "I want you to see this and tell me what you think of it." I think he might have gotten in trouble after that. I mean, I wasn't supposed to go down and talk to artists, but I remember thinking well if they come to me, that's fair game.

I know too that people would say all kinds of things like, "Tim hates artists" or "Tim won't put art ideas in," and those weren't true, but no one ever came to me and asked me that. They just heard it and then assumed that it was true, even when I would prove them wrong repeatedly. And again, because of that rule I just mentioned, it wasn't like I could go down the hall and go, "Hey everyone, I just want to talk to all your artists real quick, that I like your ideas and here's a bunch of them that have already gone in. I'm hoping to put more in." That just couldn't happen.

So then, I know some people have commented who started at Carbine late, and all I can tell you is that anyone who saw me there for the last probably eight months, I know for the last six months, I was taking notes almost every single day. I know I was a lot quieter when I was at work. I didn't resist anything, so programming said they wanted something, I'm like, "Okay." Art made more and more changes during that time, and I basically just accommodated them. As I told someone, I wasn't being a director; I was just being a coordinator. I could see that anyone who's hired at the end of 2010 or any time in 2011 would have seen a very different impression of me. I was very quiet, I was very uninvolved, I was easily swayed to anything that people wanted to put in the game, and this was even happening in the director meetings. The only time I ever spoke up was if anybody said something that was like not factually correct. Like if they said, "Oh, this ability's on this character," or "We have so many months to do this." I remember somebody once said, "Oh, we have three months to do this," and I just said, "No, according to schedule, there's only two months." And they go, "Okay, okay, I don't want to argue." And I still remember the public relations guy, the PR guy, said, "No one's arguing. I'm just pointing out the schedule only has two months in it." So, you could tell people were like primed for me to argue, and I just had stopped doing it. And at first, people thought I was being passive-aggressive, but when no pushback ever occurred, they realized I was just being passive. Some people loved that, some people, when they figured out, for example, Eric the mill, the producer, and I worked with them before and after. In fact, I've worked with a lot of people from Carbine since then. Eric was really happy that all of the arguments stopped, and he congratulated me at one point. I think it was late 2010 or maybe right after we got back from Christmas break. He said that he liked, he congratulated me for being so amenable to all these changes. But then stuff started going that he didn't like, and some of them he knew I didn't like. He knew me; he's like, "I know you from past games. You do not like these design changes." But I did nothing about it. That's when he said, "Wow, you've really lost your passion for this game," and even suggested I leave. He, at least two weeks before I turned in my notice, we had a talk, and he said, "Have you considered just leaving? I mean, if you're not into this anymore, why are you here?" And I even said, "Well, who's gonna get all the stuff done? A lot of the changes people are suggesting, they need someone to estimate how long they're going to take, who's going to work on them.

 A lot of them are based on things I've done in other games or similar to things I've done in other games, and you, I thought they needed somebody with experience at least to do that." And after the fun QA incident, I did resign, and he even told me, "Yeah, that's probably for the best."

So, I know, having read the comments, that there are some people who worked there who saw similar things happening to them or to the group they were in, and they were scared to bring it up, even some now, some people now are still scared to bring it up. I'm not going to tell your stories. I just want to say that your stories are yours to tell. I especially don't like talking about things I wasn't involved in or that I didn't witness happening. But if you saw some things happening, you should certainly talk about it. And I hope that me telling these stories help you come forward and talk about them, or at least feel better about your time there. I mean, like I said, some of the most talented people I ever worked with were at Carbine. It was just unfortunate, I think, that a lot of their talents weren't used to their fullest because stuff just got lost or redone so many times. And while I think the game that shipped was really good, I can only imagine what would have been if everybody had been going in the same direction for years before that game had shipped. There was just so much potential at Carbine, and I'm not sure that potential was fully realized. I still think WildStar was a really good MMO, and I know a lot of people liked it, and I'm glad they liked it, and the same thing I said about Fallout 2 applies here: if you liked it, like it, enjoy it, like what you like. You don't have to be put off by any perceived turmoil behind the scenes because let me just tell you, every game has turmoil going on behind the scenes, some just a little, some an awful lot, but I think you should really just enjoy the game for what it is. Anyway, that's probably the last I'll talk about this for a while. I think that's enough about Carbine.

Challenge Yourself.md

https://youtu.be/hCGaYZzpb-8?si=lGz204RKKrwRU24_

Hi everyone, it's me Tim. Today I want to talk about why you should challenge yourself, and I'm going to cut to the chase and tell you right now: success comes from challenging yourself. There, you can stop watching now. Bye.

Let me tell you, when I look at my own life what I see, and then I can give you some advice on what you can do in your life. So, I've said I've talked a lot about being in school and how I loved it. I think part of that, I was blessed when I was younger, obviously I don't have it now because when I was talking about Ricardo Montalban I couldn't even remember the word trapeze. But I talked about how I loved school when I was young. I had a phenomenally good memory. In fact, I got tested in elementary school with having an eidetic memory, photographic, but I was told it might fade, and it did.

Let me tell you what that was like in elementary school. I could glance at a page for 30 seconds or so and then I could see that page in my head. It wouldn't stay there forever, it would stay there for about a day. It would be there very clearly for a few hours and then would start to fade, and by the end of the day, I wouldn't have it in my head anymore. However, I assumed everybody could do that, and so when I had spelling tests, I didn't study. They announced a spelling test and I'd open the book and I'd stare at the page. It had all the words in a blue box in the middle of the page, and then underneath it, it had definitions and use of it in sentences, but the class was just on spelling the word. I would just look at the blue box for about 30 seconds and then we'd have the test, always got 100. I don't think that was good, that's what I did for my studying, but it helped a great deal. This initial hump in learning is having to know the facts, and then that gets you into being able to discuss them. The learning the facts was the easy part for me, so I loved getting in and discussing and chewing on things. I hope that that made me learn far more than the facts did.

Well, guess what, by the time I got to middle school, that counselor was right, it started to fade. I was having trouble doing it in seventh grade, and by eighth grade, by the time I went to high school, it was gone, and I had to learn like everyone else learned. But I had a really good foundation already. And in high school, often thought I was kind of like a big fish in a little pond. A lot of people told me that, my counselors told me that, and that was fine. I mean, it's like high school was basically I liked learning in it, but the last two years I was in high school, it was somewhere I had to go in the morning because I didn't have six-period classes, I got out of at 1 so I could go work at my game development job. That was the important thing to me. I was learning so much there, and it was paying me, and that paid for college.

When I went to college, I found out I was a big fish in an ocean, and that ocean had a lot of other fish in it, and some of those fish were way bigger than I was. But guess what, I liked it. One of the fondest memories I have of college is being in a project class with all honors students, and we had to make an automated factory, and we only had one robot-controlled arm, and I got to code it. I was the only of all the engineering honor students, I was the only one doing computer science, and I had a lot of experience, and I knew the language the robot arm was in, so I did that.

And I liked college so much that even though I had a lot of loans, I found out if you went to grad school, those loans got suspended. So I applied, I got a scholarship for a full paid first year, and I was there for four, so I paid for the other three, but my first year was paid for at grad school at UCI. And I went there where I discovered I was now a big fish in an ocean of mostly other big fish. I would say in my graduate school class, I was probably in the bottom third in terms of how bright I was and how much I picked up on ideas, and those classes were tough. You were expected to remember everything you'd ever been taught; they were not going to go over fundamentals. But it was a new kind of challenge, and I stepped up to it, and I really liked it. I found myself thinking about things more deeply than I ever had and going into far more detail on things. I learned more about computer science in grad school than I did in college, and I thought I had learned a lot in college, and I did, but wow, grad school really opened my brain to how deeply you can go into topics.

But throughout all of that, throughout high school and college and grad school, I was always learning new languages. I didn't stop. I didn't learn a language and go, "Okay, I'm done." So in high school, I learned BASIC first. I learned BASIC by teaching it from my older sister's college BASIC book, and then in school, they taught us Pascal. I liked it, but when I learned games were done in assembly or C, I taught myself those two things. I taught myself C and assembly so I could write game routines, and I made little games myself, and then I worked at that game company Pegasus, which later became Cybron. Then I went off to college. I still worked at Pegasus in Cybron in the summer, but college taught me—I mean, there we had a class on nothing but programming languages, and I learned C++ and Snowball and COBOL and Fortran, which I thought was dying. I still think it's dying, and for some reason, it's still around. I know it's used a lot in labs, and I get why. All of those are very specific languages. Snowball is for strings, COBOL is for business, Fortran is for science. I get it.

When I went to grad school, because I started doing AI, suddenly I learned Prolog and Lisp, and those were very wildly different languages than declarative languages. They were—it was interesting. You gave rules on what the computer could do, but then you didn't tell it what to do. You told it what you wanted its goal to be, and it was—it was a crazy way of thinking about programming. I loved it.

Since leaving school, I learned Perl and Python and Java and C# and all that, again on my own. Remember, this whole video is about challenging yourself. I started making engines at home by myself when I had chickenpox. There was a really bad chickenpox strain that went around in '92 in Orange County. 1992, people who had chickenpox as kids got it again. Some adults got chickenpox and died; it was that bad. I had chickenpox and strep throat on top of each other. I was stuck at home, I could barely

 sit up, but I started thinking about engines I wanted to make. I couldn't code anything, and when I came back to Interplay, they had me finish up Rags of Riches, but as soon as I was done with that, and I did my installer, I started making engines, and I did—I think I said I did a voxo engine, I did a 3D engine, finally made that sprite engine, and that's what turned into Fallout.

Um, same time I was doing that, everything had been in DOS, but things were switching over to Windows for gaming, so I taught myself Windows. And I realized there was a lot about DOS and Windows that were the same; they were just called differently, and that annoyed me. So I wrote a wrapper, the thing—I have a whole video about it, it's called GNW, so I wrapped up the OS of what I learned in Windows, and I wrapped up DOS, and that became the thing I called—I called one thing, didn't have to worry about what OS we were in. That was pretty cool because that's how we got Mac Fallout, because Chris Avalone and then later Tim Hume picked it up, did the Mac version of GNW. But that was just another way of challenging myself. It's like I had to learn these things, I had to find some way of dealing with all of this knowledge, and I did.

What was great about Interplay, by the way, was I started there as a programmer, but I very quickly got to put on a design hat, so now I had two hats on. Then when my producer had too many things and I had to wear a producer hat, I got to wear three hats, and that was great, you know. At Troika, I got to wear an owner hat. At Obsidian, I got to wear—and Carbine, I guess—I got to wear a director hat, you know, which is—I learned was very different than a lead hat because sometimes when you were a director, you stopped doing the things that you wanted to do. You stopped doing the design documents and the code because there were other people who did that. They just needed someone telling them what to do. A lot to learn, but like I said, it's a challenge. It kept being a challenge throughout my entire career. It was one new thing to pick up after another.

So if you think you've learned something and now you can go, "I can sit back and relax," it's never going to stop, and it shouldn't stop. I mean, I got to learn what it was like to develop a game solo, to work on a small team, to work on a bigger team, to run a team, to coordinate the leads of the teams that are running the teams. You know, each stage of that was something new to learn, something to figure out what I was good at and what I was bad at.

So I should probably talk about what the point of this video is. So, you need to challenge yourself to be successful. And I think challenge yourself means taking on risk, and I know, we've talked a lot about how people seem to be risk-averse. I had a video about how cautious people can be. You need to take on some risk, even if that risk is just you deciding to take some of your own time at home in the evening to learn a skill, to learn a new engine, to learn a new programming language, to learn a new 3D art package, new music generation package, video processing package. I learned DaVinci, and it isn't easy. Learn it even though it may never pay off, even though you may risk wasting your own time. The reason you need to do that is you need to figure out what level of risk you can tolerate, so you can challenge yourself, so you can do better because when you do better, you will then be successful. It's not guaranteed; some of success is timing, some of success is, you know, you were just in the right place at the right time, and the opportunity came about, but if you're not ready to take that opportunity, if you haven't prepared yourself, you're not going to be successful at it. You'll get the opportunity, but you won't be good at it.

Without all the stuff I just said about people taking risks and challenging themselves and working harder and trying to do more things, a lot of the games that you love never would have been made. And if you don't do this yourself, your own games aren't going to get made. And I've said this before: Uncle Tim needs games, and I want your games to be made. So, I—that means I want you to be successful, which means I want you to challenge yourself, which means you're going to have to take on some risks. Please do that. I guarantee you'll come out the other side happier. That's if there's one thing I just want you to hear me say in this video, is try something new. You don't have to be good at it; you just have to try it. You might be good at it, but either way, you're going to learn something, and either way, you're going to be a better person. So, I hope this helps, and I hope you make a kick-ass game for me to play.

Challenges Facing Game Artists.md

https://youtu.be/qmfZFoc53ss?si=qZ0iRXYLygR_G_-0

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim. Today, I want to finish my series on challenges that game developers face by talking about the challenges that artists face. I almost didn't do this one because I know this is going to be hard to believe, but me, a colorblind programmer by training, have never done art in a computer game. I tried. I tried to put a mouse cursor into Rags to Riches, but it was caught, and people pointed out this is a horrible mouse cursor. I thought it was pretty cool, and it was removed. I've never tried to slide any of my art in since that I remember or will allude to. However, for 42 years, I have watched what artists go through. I have worked with a lot of artists in every capacity from Junior artists up to the art directors, and I even started a company directed games with two artists who were also really good at scripting and design, and eventually, they're now like Leonard is more known as a narrative designer, and I think Jason is best known as a designer more than there are, but they're good artists too.

But I watched what happened to them, and just to remind you, I try to narrow it down to one thing for designers, I said everybody thinks they can do it. And for programmers, I said everyone will come to you for every problem in the game, no matter what kind of what caused the problem or what kind of problem whatever it's programmer got to fix it. For artists, the biggest problem I saw them facing is that everybody comments on art, and everybody almost everybody assumes that their taste is an objective proven fact, and that if they don't like it, nobody else will like it. How people manage to hold this belief in a world of you know 31 flavor ice creams and everything else, I do not know, but I've watched artists have to deal with comments like "I hate that," "That looks stupid," "That's ugly."

Well, first of all, those comments are incredibly unconstructive. What exactly are they supposed to do with that? "Oh, let me erase the ugly part." Second, it's really unprofessional, and I would love to tell you I hear those comments from people who are just starting out in the industry, but I've heard those exact comments made on games I've made by people with decades of experience. It's just shocking to me. That's not to say you can't have opinions about art. Frequently, what I would say when people wanted art feedback, I would say things like "It is very hard for me to distinguish characters from backgrounds," "Pallet is monotone," and this is coming from me. "The props and the characters don't look like they belong in the same game," so the art style of characters don't look like the art style of the props of buildings, which sometimes can happen because they're done by different people if you don't have a strong art director maintaining style. Style was a hard thing to do too, just not just agreeing on it. It's a huge road to agree on a style for a game, but then to get everybody to do the same style and to get them to agree that what they're doing is that style is its whole thing.

But I also see, or I also tried to give feedback on things like, this particular item will be viewed close up; it needs a higher resolution texture, as opposed to props that are really tall and our game doesn't have flying, so go ahead and skimp on the tops, doesn't matter. One thing that I watched happen with artists is they would get this feedback, and they would try to manage a response, even though there's no clear direction to go. So I've seen many times artists literally just throwing concept after concept out, trying to deal with this person who seems to have an idea in their head what they want but can't express it.

And yet, I think the biggest problem artists face is everybody will express their opinions on art. After it ships, everybody has opinions. I've heard people say things about games I've made, about this one looks good, this one looks bad, or whatever. Interestingly, those opinions seem to have no correlation with the sales of those games. Kind of what I was saying about those three magic numbers: sales, budget, and review scores have seemingly have no correlation. I don't know what it is that makes a game sell. Good-looking games get people interested, but I think there's a lot of good-looking boring games out there that don't do well, and then there's a lot of games that are like, this is okay, but wow, is it fun. A lot of those, especially now that we're doing retro, you know, pixel art games, nobody's going to say that this piece of art is incredibly realistic or incredibly detailed; it's just fun, and it's retro, and that's the point.

And I think, like, my bar is very low in art, so I often didn't give comments. When I did, there were things specifically about well, when I'm playing, I have a hard time, you know, Mike, I played a very early version, a beta version of Left for Dead by Valve, and I was, I commented on frequently I'd lose the cursor. I've been Left for Dead too; I'd lose the cursor into the background. You know, and I suggested just, you know, put a black outline around it, or at least check to see what all your backgrounds are and don't make the cursor that color. Lots of things like that, and by color, I mean in the HSV space, don't make their V's very similar, different values, things no matter what their hue is, if the value is different, most colorblind people can see it. So I gave feedback like that. I didn't say things like cursor's dumb or game is dumb because you can't act on that, and I think that's why I would give useful feedback on the gray box levels. I mentioned in a previous video that we often do early builds of the game with gray box because we don't have any art yet, so buildings and props or cubes and the creatures tend to not be animated and then T poses and but you're putting in the early system mechanics and testing like, it's my this jumping distance feel right, do the views I see from different parts of the game, does it make sense that I can see that cave from the town, you know what are the elevations like. Those are things you can resolve in in gray box, but a lot of people I have worked with can't do that. They constantly go back to the art, and we're like, we're not talking about art here; there's no art, it's, it's not just, and because of that, their feedback on these, the other things we're looking at, like the mechanic system mechanics or the layout degrades, they don't like it. Yet, give them the exact same level with the correct art, suddenly it's all good, those mechanics are great, these views are great. Very hard because an artist has to figure out how to process all this. It's not a pleasant thing to do.

Keep in mind too that artists are working under a lot of limitations that are imposed by the either the engine they're working on or what they're targeting, so they may have a limited number

 of textures or, you know, polygons or the textures may have a limited maximum size, the color palette may have already been picked, so now they've got to make things that people didn't think about when the color palette was picked. This is less of an issue now that we have giant color spaces, but these are all things that artists have had to and have to worry about in addition to everything else. They're trying to make a good piece of art. They're trying to make a model that looks proportionally correct, given the restrictions of poly count. They're trying to make it animate well, given a limit of like how um what memory their their animations have to fit in, how many channels they have, can they do split body if it's riding something, all these things that are usually provided for them by programmers, or the design is specified, and they've now got to work under these restrictions. Throw on top of that that modern games are far more into having accessibility and diversity of characters that you can play and see in the game, and all of that heavy lifting falls on artists. They have to make all those different characters, and they have to make them look good, and for accessibility, they have to worry about color blindness, which you know I was always on the UI team about, or anything or just fonts, you know, it's like oh, that one font you made doesn't scale well, figure it out, work, you know, make it make it work, come with your fonts, and then foster different languages, especially if you're making a font for a language you don't speak, that's always fun. These are just all things that artists, they don't do all the work there, but they carry a big brunt of it. This just falls on their plate, which is something they probably didn't think of when they were in art school when they're like painting something or, you know, drawing something, and then later on, they get a job, and they're like, hey, this isn't going to work because this kind of art won't work. China had a restriction, I don't know if they still have it, but you weren't allowed to see bone in characters, so skeletons had to be fleshed out, zombies if someone's arm got cut, you couldn't see the bone, you could you could see it cut, and you could even see blood. Oh, but Germany didn't want blood, so things had to leak green goo or oil. These are things that usually to get the game working in different regions of the world again fell back on art to do that kind of heavy lifting, and that was just something that I noticed, you know, the artist get all their stuff done, and they think they're done, they're not done.

I'm sure that there's a whole bunch of things I haven't thought of because I accidentally haven't been an artist, so I expect comments on this. I just wanted to kind of complete this triad of game developers, designers, programmers, and artists have a unique challenge they face, and I didn't want to leave artists out of that discussion. So that kind of completes this triad of videos, and I'll move on to something else tomorrow.

Challenges Facing Game Designers.md
Youtube Link:
https://youtu.be/4XzaRlW2sio?si=s3XjFmRPHkzQf2SN

Hey everyone, it's me, Tim. Today, I want to talk about what it's like to be a computer game designer. I originally was going to say what it was like to also be a programmer and an artist, even though the art one I pretty much watched seen what they go through, so I may do two more videos later on about programmers and artists. But I've got an awful lot that turned out in the design folder, so I thought I'd just limit it to if you're thinking about being a game designer or you're already in the industry as a game designer, here's some things that are going to happen.

Probably the biggest thing that will annoy you is that everybody thinks that they're a designer, and most of them, if not all of them, think they're a good designer, even though they have absolutely no idea what that process is like. And what I mean by that is, everyone on the team and everybody outside the team will constantly be thinking of ideas of what should go in the game, and they think that by having an idea, they're a designer. That is so superficial of an opinion of what a designer does that I thought I'd walk you through it. I've heard people refer to these as seagull designers because they come in, poop something, and fly off thinking my job is done. I've also heard about seagull producers; that could be a whole video of seagull people.

But let me talk about what tends to happen is someone will have an idea, "Hey, your game should do this." That's pretty much where it ends. Sometimes you can ask them, "Hey, what exactly do you mean? If it does this, won't this happen? How will you fix that? So if it does this, what about these other things? How does it interact with those things?" "I don't know. I just had an idea. Run with it." Happens all the time, by the way.

So, let me tell you what the real process of design is. Someone will have an idea, hopefully not one of those seagull designers, and then it gets converted to a specification. This is where ninety percent of those want to be designers fail. They don't know how to do this; they don't even know what it is. They really underestimate how hard it is, and if they do write one, it's usually way under-specified. But a specification for a design feature is fairly specifically scoped for that feature. So it's not combat; it might be melee combat; it might be two-handed melee combat and its interaction with skills and other abilities in the game, and perks and items. Here's the specific items that are used by this two-handed weapon, melee skill. Already it's already like, these are big.

It usually starts, as I mentioned, with goals. What are you trying to do with this? What is your intent? This is important so that later on, you can talk about whether or not what you've written meets that intent or if anyone wants to change it, does it still meet the intent, or you can talk about, "I think your intent is wrong. I think we should be trying to do this," which is a completely different kind of conversation.

Then the specification itself goes into great detail on that feature. How is it used in the game? How does it interact with other features in the game? What kind of implementation you need? This is where eventually this designer, or another designer, will come in with a formula or numbers because eventually a programmer has to step in, read this document, understand what you're trying to do from the goal section, read the rest of it, and see what he's supposed to do or she, and then implement it. And if you don't have formulas, if you don't have numbers, if you don't have links to all the other thing features that this feature interacts with, that programmer is going to be unhappy, and he's going to be in your office all the time.

Similarly, an artist, usually the lead artist, and then they assign it, looks at these and goes, "Oh, this feature is going to need this kind of user interface or this kind of art for an item or an armor or an animation or a prop." So all these people get involved in that specification stage. It can take a while to do this, and usually, one of those seagull designers, they're long gone.

Then a programmer will actually get assigned this and try to implement it. They will come by the whoever wrote specification; they will be in your office a lot. We go back and forth; things may have to be changed. When they go to implement it, they may discover that there are things in the implementation that don't fit with things that are already done. So then you have to decide, is this worth changing those existing things that might get a producer involved, "We don't have time to make these changes," or maybe those other things are already causing problems, so he's like, "Oh, I'm so glad. Let's remove that. That is causing issues," or "Let's change it."

Then it gets implemented. Usually, when the program is implementing it, they discover art that will be needed for implementation. Sometimes art is made right then; sometimes, if the artists are busy, it's made later. So the feature's brought as close to finish as it can, gets blocked on Art. An artist will eventually go in and make the art needed for it. It gets unblocked, usually goes back to the programmer who finishes it up, then it goes to QA.

I mean, we're not nearly done with the thing. It goes into QA, where QA, as is their job, will bang on it as hard as they can and try to break that feature. Let me tell you, they are very successful at doing that. And also, I've watched other producers get mad at QA for finding these problems, and it could be a bug in the implementation, or it could just be a problem with the design itself. And I've seen, I've witnessed producers yell at QA people for finding these things. It blew my mind, and I caught a few of them out on them, like, "Why are you yelling at this person? You should be happy they found it before it shipped."

So when they found this box, it goes back into that iterative implementation specification cycle because it may be they found a problem with the design itself, which means it needs to be respect. They may find a bug in the implementation, which means it needs to be recoded, or this art doesn't loop like, maybe it's, um, or interrupt correctly. Maybe you're it's you know, a reloading thing, and it doesn't interrupt correctly, or it needs to loop a few times because this gun has a lot more ammo, so it shows reloading in the original art doesn't doesn't loop. It could be a lot of things, and it goes to different people, which is why, by the way, producers are so great because they monitor this whole process and keep people from going insane.

So finally, it's done and in the game, and the two things you now, as the designer, will encounter: one, if this original idea came from a seagull designer, they will take 100% credit for it, even though they were not involved in the 99

% of the Herculean effort required to get this thing out. Also, and this is why I took a lot of notes, and I still, with my notes, there are disagreements. When that feature finally goes out and people go, "I love blah in this game. I love feature X," who's responsible for feature X? Is it the person who had the high-level idea? Is it the person who wrote that very detailed specification that everybody read and worked off of? Is it the person who actually coded it? Is it the person who did the art for it, and maybe why people like it so much, it's like, "Oh my God, that looks so cool"? Is it QA, who found all the problems done all of them by the previous people, and got it working right? So who's whose feature is that? This is why frequently, you know, I could do a whole video on that. I could probably do a whole video about how I could do whole videos.

But this is why sometimes I'll go, "Oh, that that was Bob's idea. That was Mary's idea," and sure enough, uh, get an email or a private DM, and they're go, "You know, that actually was this person's," and we talk about it, we find out. Sometimes we find out we're both wrong; it was actually somebody else's.

I'm definitely going to do it. I will do a whole video about how companions came out in Fallout, and you can, you can fight over who should have credit for that.

But anyway, that that is a good example of what you will go through as a designer. And then let me give you some idea because the whole thing started with those seagull designers that come by and poop something on your desk and then they fly away. Let me go over some things that got pooped on my desk for reals.

So years ago, when MMOs were first getting started, MMOs really got came out in the late 90s; this was probably early 2000s. It could have been 99, but I think it was 2000. Sierra dropped something off at my desk. It was a specification of another company doing another game that looked like it was going to be an MMO; it was online multiplayer. They wanted it to have permanent depth. Let me describe what they thought was a cool feature. You'd log into their server, you'd make a character, and you'd go out in the world. You'd have fights, you talk to people, you quest, you craft, and I was, if you ever died, you're dead. Boom, back to the character generator own. Your character, his items, and all that, they're just, when something dies, whoever kills them can loot them, so it's gone. They thought this was a good idea.

Now, to put this in context, lots of games do this idea of permanent death, usually they're single-player. You're playing at home, and the way they work is, you know, you, you say, "I want to play this mode." Tempo had this, but it's by far not the only one. We call it Iron Man mode. You say, "I want to play Iron Man mode." We go, "Okay." When you save, it takes you back to the main menu; you don't get to keep playing. When you load an Iron Man, when you load an Iron Man saved game, it deletes it after it's loaded, so there is no save games to go back to. This is an interesting way to play because it's the raid original d&d tabletop is played. You played, and if you died and no one could raise you, you, you're done. It's an interesting way to play a single-player game. I don't think that's a good way to play an MMO for a lot of reasons, the main one which is you can sometimes die, and it was completely not your fault. In a single-player game, if you die, ultimately you probably did something you shouldn't have, but an MMO, you might die for all kinds of reasons. You might die because somebody in your party didn't taunt the creature off of you because that's their job as a tank, or your healer didn't heal you, and that was their job's healing, or the group decided to go into a dungeon, and you're like, "This is way over a level," and they convince you it's not. The problem with that is once it becomes in the player's mind not their fault that they died, it's really hard to have that kind of mode. Plus, in an MMO, especially with a lot of other ones out there that don't have this, that's a problem.

So I wrote back and said, "I think this is an issue," along with a bunch of other things I saw as an issue like some races were restricted to people who had proven themselves fans of the game, so you had to put in like 100 hours or get a character up the Mac level cap before you were allowed to play the races. Nowadays, this is called unlock, but the way they, they um, presented it was as unless you proved that you're a fan of this game, yeah, you don't get to be this race.

Another, uh, design idea that got pooped on my desk one day was, "Hey, we're trying to get rid of, we're trying to sand off the rough edges of the game. We should get rid of encumbrance. Nobody likes encumbrance. I should be able to pick up anything I want and not be forced to move slowly or not fast travel. I just want to be able to pick up everything I want." I was like, "Okay, but another problem we're already having with this game is your inventory gets too big, and it's hard to manage your inventory when there's hundreds of items in it. Won't this make it work worse? Won't that make that a lot worse?" "Oh yeah, I didn't think of that, but you know, we've got to solve that anyway, so let's, let's just roll it in with that." I'm like, "Yeah, but encumbrance kind of solves that by saying we know the maximum of what you're going to carry except ammo, which we made weightless, but it, there's only so many ammos, and they stack," which led to a whole other conversation about how that same person wanted us to get rid of ammo. In other words, ranged weapons, every ranged weapon had an infinite firing capacity. Now, while I thought infinite ammo on a particular weapon drop would be an interesting, you know, Advantage, here's a weapon, it may not be that great, but it's got infinite ammo. But once everything has infinite ammo, you now have to balance them in a different way. Plus, that was kind of the advantage of melee weapons; they never run out of ammo. Now ranged weapons never run out of ammo, they both can be used instantly. Melee weapons don't even become the ranged character's fall back, "Oh, I'm completely out of ammo. At least I can stab them with this knife." I asked this person how they would change the existing specifications of those other features, and they basically said, "Well, that's

 your job." And I'm like, "No, my job is to get my stuff in the game. If you want this in the game, you're going to explain to me that other stuff." They didn't; that stuff wasn't put in the game.

And then the last story is, I actually worked with a designer who thought, and told me, that a designer's job is to kill the player, and he meant it. He thought his goal as a designer, and he bases off his goal as a DM, was this notion that you tried to kill the player. I asked him, I'm like, "Do you really mean challenge, you know, with really good combat and dialogues that can lead to being attacked and stealth where you get caught?" He said, "No, you're trying to kill the player. That's your goal. That's every, every thing you write, every feature, the main goal is how could this end up killing the player?" That was an interesting discussion because I don't agree with it. I could see how you could make a game that way. That wasn't my goal, and he got really upset, and he said, "Well, if that's not the goal, what is your goal?" And I was like, "To entertain the player." My goal in every game is that the person playing should have fun, and no, that's nebulous, but that's why you write goals at the top because they are supporting ultimately a top-level goal, in which case, it was for me to have fun. This is why sometimes my games aren't balanced. I'm not as focused on balance as I am on fun. If people can find a way to make it really easy to kill some monster or to make a build that's more powerful than another build, I'm usually okay with that. The only thing I don't like is if you can make a build that can't finish. I don't like that, but I'd also say that easily falls under the rule that's not fun. If you make a build and 70% of the way through a game, you find out, "I can't complete the game with this character I made," that's not fun. That is the definition of not fun.

So, I tried to convince him that killing the player was not his number one priority, but I did tell him, "I look forward to playing a game that you eventually direct where that is your number one goal."

So, I hope I didn't discourage anyone from ever wanting to be a designer, but that is what you're up against as a designer. And I think the other roles don't have that notion that many people have that "I could do your job." I don't see people going up to programmers going, "Yeah, I could code that better than you." I certainly don't see people going to artists and saying, "I could easily make a creature that animates better than that, or I could model something about that here, move aside, let me do it." Never happened. I've never seen that happen. I've seen that happen in design many, many, many times. So, if you want to be a designer, be aware. Don't let that discourage you, just go in knowing that that's going to happen.

Challenges Facing Game Programmers.md

https://youtu.be/Qc8zuhaqWPM?si=C_R1EvoxP-xzfdgH

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim. Today, I want to continue from yesterday's video about challenges designers face. I want to talk about challenges programmers face. I've done both design and programming about 50/50. Before I jump in, I apologize, my Nuka Cola shirt is in the wash.

So, let's talk about what I think is the single most important personality attribute for programmers in the video game industry to possess. Now, you may think, oh, it's intelligence, oh it's a broad knowledge of programming algorithms and data structures, or it's specialization in one of them. No, it is patience. And the reason for that is, if you decide to make video games and you're a programmer, you will be blamed for every single bug in the game. Get used to it; it never will stop. Okay, we'll even talk about steps I tried to take to make that not happen, and they all failed.

But before I get to that, a lot of people think, well, Tim, all bugs are by definition the programmer's fault because it happens in code. Nope, there's a bunch of ways to make a game buggy that have nothing to do with the code. For example, it is not possible to make code handle every error situation it will ever happen. Let me explain that there's actually a known thing called the halting problem. When a little technical here, which basically states there is no way to make a sufficiently advanced system that as input comes into it can examine that input and say, this input stream, I can eventually stop executing.

So, what that basically means is you can't write a program that examines other programs and says for sure that program can end. It will never get in an infinite loop; it will never, um, run forever. And that's called the halting problem. There's no known way of making an out an algorithm that can detect if a program will eventually stop. You can extend that to because of that, there's really no way then of knowing that every possible input that can happen to a piece of code can be detected to be error-free.

And by the way, even if you can, I'll tell you something that would happen. Um, so that means that there's a ton of ways for artists, scripters, designers to introduce bugs into a game, and we have to extend this does that mean more than just crash bugs. But I've seen crash bugs happen because of that. But every single time a bug happens, the programmers are always the first, hey, the game crashed here, hey, the game isn't working correctly here, hey, the game gets really slow here, figured out.

Now, a lot of times it's not a programmer's fault who did that, but you have to go to a programmer because they have the tools to find it. But even when we try to provide those tools or similar tools outside of programming, many, many, many of the other developers won't or don't use them. I'll give you an example. When I was working on a game, there was a problem where it could run out of memory. So we started writing an error message which would be displayed at the bottom of the screen. It would also go into an error log that would say the game is running low on memory. I mean, this could be a lot of reasons it could be too many creatures are in the scene, it could be, you know, some textures got imported that were supposed to be no bigger than 2K squared, and for some reason, somebody thought a 256K squared texture was okay. Still, programmers would be saw it going the game isn't it's running really slow or it crashed here, and they're like they look at the log and I'm like, it ran out of memory. Didn't you notice that? I didn't notice that, or well, I saw that, but it's not my fault.

So even trying to detect a condition and warn them, hey, you've got too much stuff going on here, figure it out. So it was up to the programmer to go, well, there's a really big texture here, or, you know, you're trying to have 200 creatures in the scene, and they all load in all this ancillary art and scripts and associated data, and there's literally just not enough. But there was one time, and this happened on Fallout, where the game ran out of memory so much that I couldn't even create a window to print a string into saying I'm out of memory. I just had to crash. I couldn't even print the string with the memory condition because I couldn't allocate memory to write that string into.

The solution to this was, when Fallout would start up, it would allocate that error window at startup, but that meant Fallout now ran with slightly less memory than it could have in the off chance that an error would happen and I need to print out the reason. On the off chance that whoever saw that error message would actually pay attention to it, which as you've seen, sometimes that doesn't happen. Now, this has happened for the entire 40-some years I've been making games in. Fallout, an artist made a sprite, an animated sprite that was, it was either the size of this, the entire size of the screen, or maybe even bigger because something exploded. When that sprite, when the game tried to load that sprite, it had to throw out all the other art to make it work. And if any of that other art was locked, meaning it was literally being used in that scene, you could see it on the screen at that time, it couldn't be thrown out. So, depending on when you ran the game, maybe it could throw away enough contiguous blocks because it had to load in that giant sprite. Could you think maybe you could find enough contiguous memory to load it, maybe it couldn't.

So, that displayed itself as, hey, when you're when you get near this part of the game, sometimes it crashes, sometimes it gets really slow, and sometimes it works fine, fix it. While the bug was, first of all, don't create art that's literally that big. In fact, I think we changed the art tool to warn, hey, you made something that looks too big. I'll give you one guess at how many artists actually paid attention to the warning messages that that art tool made.

But this is a good example of, you know, at some point, the artist put it in, the game was working, they put in their piece of art, it didn't work. You would think that would be a big clue, the thing I just did is causing a problem. No, programmer, fix it, fix it. That's what I mean, patience, Zen, home, no, this will wash over me. The another one that was funny, Leonard and I even talked about this on a stream, so I will name it because he did it. I didn't put go-to's in the script language I created for Arcanum, go-to's are the devil's plaything, and I know that a lot of our scripters would not be trained programmers, and I wanted things to be easier for them. So, I gave them all the for loops they wanted. Um, but the for loop was written in such a way that it had a beginning and an end. The script would

 also, there was no way of putting in um conditionals that would force a loop that would never end. I thought I had it mastered. I should have learned my lesson. Leonard described what he did. I did have to put in a way for scripts to call other scripts because we had if then, but the the block for the then and else, there was a limited amount you could do in it. So, what they ended up doing was saying, well, if this condition, then call script A, which does a lot of things, or call script B, which does a lot of things. I thought that's really good; it also helps them partition their work, and maybe scripting script B can be used by other scripts. Great, right? No, one of the first things Leonard did, he had script A call script B, but then script B could call script A, and it would loop, and the stack would blow, and the game would explode, and he'd become, there's something wrong. And when I pointed out this script you wrote, it, this is the one doing it. Haha, we had a big laugh, and the first thing I did was I put in a script limiter. I originally tried to do it by counting those things, but then they found ways of, you know, script A would call B, which is called C, which called back to A, or call back to B, and then back to, so I kind of just put in if a script runs more than a certain number of milliseconds, it got cut off, and a warning message got printed. So, of course, that meant new bugs were introduced because a script that got called never finished. It didn't complete what it was supposed to set up, so there'd mean incomplete state, but at least there'd be something in the law going, this script didn't finish running, you may be suffering from an incomplete state. So, at least a programmer could point to that and go, this is your problem.

Even more recently at Obsidian, um, when I first started there, there was a problem where there was a level in South Park that got very, very, very slow. We're talking the frame rate dropped from 30 frames a second to maybe two. Of course, a scripter came to me and said, you got to fix this, we don't know what's going wrong. When I looked at it, there was a different scripter, not the one who came to me, who every tick of the game, he grabbed every object in the game, tried to look up a property on that object, and then based on that property, decided to do something, every tick. That was the source of the slowdown. I suggested several solutions, which included when the level first loaded, go through all the objects, find the ones with the properties you want, and cache them. Or it turns out the property was something that we already had a search for object with the reality structure, object named this, search for object of this type. We already had sub searchers which were way more optimized because instead of happening in scripts, that happened in code, and a lot of them, we already, when we loaded them in, we already put them into these categories, so we already had lists available like here's every object of this type. I suggested those. They switched it, turns out they were looking for something with a particular name, so not only could it be cashed, there was a already a function look for objects of this name. Boom, we're back up to 30 frames a second.

The interesting thing about that was like, how was this not noticed the moment that script was written and that level was run, the frame rate dropped. I would expect the person to go, hmm, I wonder if the thing I just did, which was the only change from running at 30 frames a second to running at two frames a second, caused it. There is this thing that a lot of other developers learn, a lot of non-program developers, which as soon as there's a problem, just go get a programmer because programmers have lots of tools, and they can find the exact problem really quickly. But what this means is as a programmer, you're frequently interrupted. And I know, I know, everybody hates getting interrupted in their work, but sometimes you're coding something, and in your head, you've got this data structure and algorithm that's all set up, and you're coding it, and you're thinking of like, okay, I have to do this if, but I need to check for this thing, and then I have to do this in the else conditional, and I've got to do this, I got to do this. And then somebody walks in goes, hey, can I ask you a question? And you're and that that structure in your head just goes. And so I find a lot of people like, programmers can be so, I don't know, they hate when you ask them questions. No, we don't. It's just, it's sometimes really hard to get complex algorithms written when you're literally being interrupted every 15 or 20 minutes. This is why a lot of programmers shut the doors to their offices, why they want offices and not large open plan offices, why they use headphones, why they set up office hours and quiet times. It's not because they don't like you; it's just it's very, very hard to code when you get interrupted. I find that my tolerance for interruptions while designing is much higher than my tolerance for interacting by coding. And that's me; that's the same person. So, depending on what I'm doing, I either don't mind getting interrupted, or I'm like, ah, you have interrupted my code, which would have been a flawless time, and may now have a bug in it, which happened a few times in my career. I actually wrote code that that had a bug in it. I'm glad you were sitting down when you were watching this because I know that may come as a shock.

So, that's why sometimes when I interview programmers, and I'm asking them questions about their education, about their programming abilities, I give them tests to do to watch them do it on the whiteboard. Sometimes I'm looking at what they're doing, and I'd say usually, you know, if they're talking something, I'm paying attention to what they're doing. But sometimes I'm paying attention to how they handle me asking questions about what they're doing because unbeknownst to them, I was looking to see how patient they were in the meeting, even if that meant later I would see things like, well, Tim has some really dumb questions, but he interrupted me a lot. There was a goal; I had a goal in mind. I wanted to know what you would be like when you were on this team, and you were going to get questions from non-programmers. I wanted to see how you would react to them. And I always assumed I would get reacted to the best since I was going to be your boss. But I had people get snippy with me in programming reviews, and I said, and I thought, I can only imagine what this person would do if a peer or someone they viewed as less than a peer ask them a question.

So sometimes, if you look back at an interview and you're like, why was

 I asked that? You sometimes have to look for a different context. I wasn't digging around for your programming information. I'm just trying to figure out what you would be like working with. And that's true. I had different questions for designers. I never directly hired an artist, but they have different questions for artists too. You work in a group. The era of single-person games, except for very narrowly scoped indie games, is gone. So, I look for patient programmers, and I think that's important.

Characters Named Cain.md

https://youtu.be/vG8WWB_HYho?si=pxf2FvyM6J-ATnwQ

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim. Yesterday's video was kind of heavy, so today's video I want to go a little lighter, and I want to talk about all the freaking characters named Kane. Growing up, of course, my last name's Kan, and I kept hearing my last name used in books, TV, movies, video games. Cut it out now. Sometimes it's because it was biblical, and they're making an allegory, sometimes not. I had a teacher in high school who loved to ask, when he's talking to the class, "Caine, are you able to answer this question?" And of course, I was a teenager at the time, so I had to go there. Even is a brand of hot cocoa called canes, but I want to talk about fictional canes.

I was originally going to say, you know, let's skip books and TVs and movies and go straight to video games, but no. I want to talk about all this use. I was a big Conan fan when I was a teenager; that's by Robert E. Howard. But he wrote another character called Solomon Caine. It's spelled different, but it's still a cane, and he wrote that in the 1920s. And Solomon Kane is a kind of anti-hero, even before that term was used. But it was kind of a popular character. I think he even got some comic books. Um, now he wasn't the first. Lord Byron wrote a play in 1821 that was just called "Cain," but I believe that was biblical.

But there was a movie that came out called "The Cain Mutiny," and until I saw it, I thought it was because there was like a captain Kane. Kane is the boat. Uh, growing up, there was a TV show called "Kung Fu," and the lead character was named Kane. And in a bit of, you know, W, you can tell this is the '70s, he was playing a Chinese character, and he was white. I was more excited when "Battle Star Galactica," the original show, introduced Commander Kane, and that was cool to watch. And then when they did the series reboot, Commander Kane came back. That was cool. Of course, there's a movie called "Citizen Kane," very famous. Um, there's a Kane in "Alien," and some people don't catch this, CU he's only called Caine, I think, four or five times. It's the guy who gives birth to the alien out of his stomach. Sorry if I spoiled that movie, but made in 1979, if that was a spoiler, too bad.

Interestingly, there's a character named Kane in "Matrix Reloaded," and I did not catch this. I only knew his name was Kane because I watched the credits, and something wrote by named Kane. He was um, he worked for the maravian, the French guy, and I think he was supposed to be a vampire. I don't know, that movie was kind of let's move on. There was a Kanan "Highlander: The Final Dimension." I will admit I stopped watching the movies after the second one, and I think for good reason. Um, Kane is in a ton of comic books, and I will admit I'm not a big comic book reader. But what surprised me was Batwoman and Batgirl were both named Kane. Kathy Kane was Batwoman, and Cassandra Kane was Batgirl. Also, apparently, there's a whole comic book line in the Spider-Man universe where someone cloned Spider-Man, and they named the Clone Kane, and he hates Spider-Man, and he tries to kill Spider-Man.

My favorite use that I will allow of the name Kane: I love the show "Community," and in there, there's a professor Kane. He's the biology professor. I loved his character because he was very serious, and he ended up with the study group in his biology class, and he hated them. He hated them. He called them the mean click. So, I really, if you haven't watched "Community," you should watch "Community." Professor Kane, yeah. But now let's look at video games, which have used the name cane to death. I think the first time I went, "Hey," was when "Diablo," the original "Diablo," came out, and the main character, the GU guy who talks like this who sit and sit a while, and I'm going to tell you a story. I'm horrible with Impressions. His name was Deckard Kane. I remember going to my boss, Tom Decker, and said, "Hey, is this guy named after us?" I mean, Deckard Kane. Now, I'm guilty of this too. In "Bloodlines," there were the cab driver's name was Cain, but to be fair, that's part Cain exists in the "Bloodlines" universe, and we never come right out and say it's Kane.

There is a character named Timothy Kane in the "Resident Evil" series. He's even in one of the movies, I think, and made me go, "Wait a minute, that," and he's, it's Kane is spelled C-A-I-N, and I'm like, "Hey, is that me?" He wasn't a good guy either. At least I don't think he was a good guy. I think he got killed. There's another Commander Kane, not Batt Star Galactica, in "Command and Conquer," and I remember seeing that and going, "Hm." There's a Dr. Kane in "Mega Man," and I was. I played "Ultima 3," and then the other Ultimas, I, I didn't finish any "Ultima" except "Ultima 3," but I played a lot of the other ones. There is an alchemist named Cane in "Ultima 7." There may be even canes in other ones. I don't know. I mean, I could go on. There's canes, appear characters named Cane appear in "Final Fantasy 4," in "Fire Emblem," in "Zork Nemesis," the text adventure, in "Xenogears," in garans. There's a can and city of here, and I worked at the sister company carbine, and I was like, "Hey, there's too many canes here."

There is a whole family of characters named Cane in the "Twisted Metal" series of games. There's a guy named Kane in "Mass Effect 2," and of course, we can't overlook an entire video game series named "Legacy of Cain." So what's my point in this video? I don't really have one. This is lighthearted. Don't read too much into it, but hey, you book authors, hey, you TV and movie scriptwriters, and especially I'm looking at you, game designers, narrative designers, writers, stop making characters named Kane. It has been done to death. There's literally a million other names that you could use. Stop using cane. Stop it. You're thinking about it, aren't you? Stop it. And you know what, this has been a short, light-hearted video, and I'm going to stop here, like you should stop using cane.

**Intro**

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim, and today I want to talk about class versus skill-based role-playing games. I've read a lot of discussion online about this for years. Some people think classes are the way to go. They're original, they're how things were done a long time ago, they're a tried and true and tested. I've heard other people say no, skills are the way to go, they're the best, they're the new wave, even though they've been around for 20 years. I think that the real answer, of course, is a little one, little the other. So what I wanted to do is talk about the pros and cons of class-based systems because I realized every pro of class is a con of skill, and vice versa. So, let's talk about why designers and players even like class-based RPGs.

**Classes**

Classes provide a nice bundle of skills and feats and other things. It's the designer's way of saying, hey, I've already pre-picked a bunch of things that work well together and have been designed together and balanced together. So when you pick a fighter class, it's good for fighting. When you pick a wizard class, it's good for doing magic. When you pick a rogue class, it's good for stealing. It just these things come with luckily with good a good kind of baggage that tell you how to play that class. At least for fantasy games, there are so many tropes that exist for fantasy, and I'll talk about that in a bit, that classes being one of them, it just makes it very easy to know what you're getting, which gives me my second advantage of class-based systems. They're very easy to understand for you, the player who is coming to a new system. When you see oh, there's a fighter, I have an idea of what he's gonna do. Oh, there's a rogue, I have an idea what he's gonna do. And it's not just for you, the player playing that character. If you're playing in a party, it's very easy for them to understand what you're going to do and what your role in the party is going to be. If you're playing a fighter type, you're gonna tank. You're the one who's expected to wade, you know, forth and attack that monster. If you're playing a wizard, you're probably gonna hang back and shoot spells. Yeah, there are two classes, and yeah, there are some classes that hybridize those two things, but in general, people know what those roles are. Which brings me to the third reason class-based systems are good, is when you first start a class-based RPG, it is very easy for you to pick a character. Not only are they easy to understand and all the skills are bundled, it just makes it easier for you to pick one because there aren't hundreds of choices, there's usually six, ten, maybe 15. That's a lot easier to pick than looking at lists of hundreds of skills and wondering, gee, I wonder which one of these are going to be used in this campaign.

I remember there was a character that a friend of mine made when I ran a GURPS campaign, and she put most of her points into Savoir Faire because she thought of her character as this uptown elegant lady. And of course, when combat broke out, she was like, "Can I Savoir Faire them?" And I asked her exactly what she meant by that. I said, "If you can role-play it, I'll let you roll." And it was hard to come on like someone's shooting at you with a gun, and you're like, "That's, you know, that's a really low-class way of acting, don't you think?" Not sure what you're trying to get to happen with that guy with the gun, but it just kind of emphasizes the point of if she'd had a few classes to pick from, that would have been a lot easier. But there were literally in GURPS hundreds of skills, she had no idea what was going to happen.

Similar to this, once you're playing the game and you level up, it's easy to level a class because they usually come with a list of skills that they're allowed to buy and feats they can advance, and those are often restricted by level or some of them like their skills that are marked as specifically for that class, so spending a point in them is worth more than if you buy an off-class skill. So you're already guided on how to level up this character, wherein a skill-based system, who knows?

And then, related similar to that, as you adventure and find items in a class-based system, it's really easy to decide who gets the items. Sometimes items are restricted to a class, like something will drop and they said this is wizard only, or this is thief only. Great, we only have one in the party, they get it. But like if a sword drops, you're probably going to give that to the fighter. Maybe the cleric can't even use it, or the rogue may want it, but if the fighter is currently doesn't have a magic weapon and it's a magic sword, you probably want to give it to the fighter first. Then if another magic weapon drops, you can give that to the rogue, and of course, the wizard and the cleric don't care about those things. So classes make it very easy to distribute items among the party.

And then the last big reason class-based systems are popular have nothing to do with players but anything to do with the designers. It is much, much, much easier to balance a class-based system because there's only, like I said, a few classes you can buy. It's easy, and those come with pre-bundled feats and skills. It's very easy to balance classes against each other so no one class is much, much better than another class in particular situations. Yeah, there will be one class that's a lot better than another class one-on-one fight with an orc. I'd rather be a fighter than a wizard, a one-on-one fight with an orc face to face. Of course, you don't want to be a wizard. Maybe if they start at a distance and you have time to get a spell off, maybe. But disadvantages, the advantages and disadvantages of those classes have already been examined by the designer or the design team and balanced out. That's almost impossible to do if you have hundreds of skills. There will always be some skills that are so situational that somebody who buys up them is just not going to be good in any other situation, which brings me to the downside of classes.

When you play a class-based RPG, you kind of have to know how you want to play right away because there's only so many classes and they're very limited on what they can do. You want to cast spells, don't take a fighter. You want to wade into battle, you probably don't want to be a wizard. If the party really needs a healer, that pretty much restricts what that class is going to be. You basically have to decide that if you're making a party and you want a healer, someone's got to play it, and someone's got to take that class.

Which brings to the second negative for class-based systems, which is you don't get to

 play how you want. You may have this really cool idea in your head, but it doesn't really fit with the existing classes. Let's say you're playing D&D, and you want to be Indiana Jones, which means you have a gun and a whip and archaeologist archeology skill. Well, there's really no good class that covers that. You could probably be a fighter, you know, but that comes with a whole bunch of things that aren't Indiana Jones, and you just have to ignore them. You could be a rogue, but that also comes with a bunch of skills that you're never going to use, or because they're there and probably good, maybe you will use them, but now your character of Indiana Jones isn't really acting like Indiana Jones. The game is telling you how to act, not your conception, and that's a problem with class-based games is those the wonderful tropes that make it very easy to pick and level up a class also kind of define how they're going to play them to a big extent. It doesn't determine your personality or your background, but I'm talking about like in terms of actions, it's kind of predefined what you're going to do.

And then the other thing about class systems, which is a negative, is you can't experience extreme characters. The advantage I talked about about all the classes being balanced by a designer, that's great if that's what you want is balance. I love extreme characters. I love playing a character where I put a ton of points into a few things. I had a GURPS character once that I gave an 18 dexterity to. That took almost all my points. So the few points I had left over, I think I got him, uh, he had a rapier, and he had the skill in that, so he was good at stabbing people and parrying. But if something got by his parry, he tended to go down. And his attacks didn't do much damage because he wasn't very strong, but he would almost always hit. So he'd kind of like whittle down enemies. It was an extreme character and really cool. You may not be able to make that in all class-based systems. My friend's Saph walk here, Sapphire character, certainly couldn't be made in most class-based systems.

So, everything I just said about classes that are pros are cons and skills. In skill-based systems, you don't have bundled skills. They're not necessarily easy to understand for a starting person. It's not easy for you to join a group and them to understand exactly what you can do. It's hard to pick what skills you want out of the hundreds of skills. When you level up, you're faced with that decision again. Do you want to continue up the skills you already have, or do you want to pick a new skill from the hundreds of skills that are available? And it's and there's no guarantee that the selection of skills you pick will be balanced by the designer in that game. Or even if he tried to, who knows? Like in GURP, for the setting can be wildly different. Savoir Faire would be great in a city-based campaign, really bad in a dungeon adventuring campaign.

So, I think it requires a lot of intervention from the GM when you have skill-based systems if you want that. The cons of class-based or the pros of skill. You can, you have an idea in your head, you can play that exact character exactly how you want with the skills you want, even if they're really extreme and they don't fit any any trope for the setting you're playing. So I like that in some ways.

Everything I just described about class versus skill, you can say about fantasy versus sci-fi settings. The advantage that fantasy settings have is because all these tropes exist, the character knows, the player knows what a vampire is. Now, yeah, Twilight vampire is very different than a masquerade vampire, but in general, it's this blood-sucking spirit, you know, supernatural creature. But when you go to play sci-fi, that is incredibly setting-specific. What's a darlock? Do you even know? Do you even know where that from without having to Google it? I thought it was Doctor Who; it's not. Oh, but what's a Reaper? Oh, wait, that is Doctor Who. No, it's not. It's X-Com. No, it's not. It's Mass Effect. It's all of them, and those Reapers are three wildly different aliens.

So, similar to where fantasy and sci-fi have that disparity, so do class and skill-based, and you have to overcome, you have to teach the player more in a skill-based system. Now, if you look at all my games, I went skill-based for Fallout and Arcanum, two of my first RPGs, and then Outer Worlds, my latest RPG. But then in the middle there, I went class-based for Temple, for Vampire Bloodlines, for South Park, for Pillars, for Tyranny. So you may be trying to decide, well, do you like class-based, Tim, or do you like skill-based? It sounds like you liked class; you like skill-based, but then you went into class-based, and then you changed your mind recently. Not really. Here's my rule: I prefer a class-based RPG if it's a multiplayer game, or it's a single player game where the player makes a party of characters. I like how class is define the roles, make help make those characters more distinct, and if it's a multiplayer game, help convey to the other players what role you're be fulfilling. For single player and single character RPGs, I like going skill-based. I don't like that restriction of classes. If you want to make some extreme character and play, I almost encourage that. It's fun to see if you can do that. GURPS had a name for mages who only took one spell but all their points in it, Johnny One Spell, like you take a firestone, all you can do is burn things. But wow, can you burn things. It's really bad when you encounter a fire elemental which is immune to fire, but for everything else, it's awesome.

So, and that's just something that you have to learn when you play. So that's kind of the role I use, multiplayer and party-based games, classes, single player, single character game, skill. If push came to shove and you gave me a bag of money, I'm gonna pick single player, single character, so I can go skill-based. It's on my teeter-totter. I'm a little more skill-oriented than class, but that doesn't mean I don't understand why class-based design is good and what it's used for.

Okay, I think that's a lot of thoughts on class versus skill. I'm sure you have your own thoughts. I just kind of wanted to get it all down. It's come up a few times in comments, and it was on my list of topics to talk about anyway.

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim, and today I want to talk about how I structure code, and this was a question from a lot of different people, including greenia 84, who asked that I do it using an example of inventory, which I think is a good question or good specification because inventory contains a number of interesting things about code structure and it's common to a lot of RPGs. So, I'll talk about that now.

One thing that I really, really want to stress before I even talk is, no matter what I'm doing, I like to keep system mechanics separate from UI. So, I'm going to explain how I do that in the context of inventory, and I'm going to start with mechanics and then talk about how this thing becomes a component on different things and then how it's used by UI, that component.

So, let's start with the basic mechanics of inventory. Remember, because it's divorced from UI, inventory should have no idea how it's being displayed on the screen. It doesn't care, and you should not make it care. You will only make your code too complicated if you make it care. So, inventory itself should have a list of items. I don't care how you want to store it; it could be a linked list, could be a doubly linked list, could be an array, could be a resizable array. I don't care.

So, it has this list of items. Here's the functionality that I think you need to include: you want `add item` and `remove item`, and that adds one onto that list and removes it from the list. They always work, so they're void returning. You just pass it an item, and it either adds it in, or if you give it an item on remove, it finds it on the list and takes it out. They don't return any failure codes. Why? Because there are associated functions `can add` and `can remove` that you should also write. That if you call `can add` and it returns true, boom, you can add it. It doesn't add it, but you can. If you call `can remove` and it returns true, you can remove it. It doesn't matter. You know, it just finds it on the list and determines the condition under which it's removable.

Now, both `can add` and `can remove` have failure codes. So, if they return false, they also return a failure code. And those, like `can add`, could be you don't have a spot for it, um, it's too heavy, all the things that have to do with just putting it on that list that are part of the mechanics. Not that there's, you know, if you have a grid of things, that you're not putting it on the grid correctly. I'll get to that.

`Can remove` can return failure codes like this item, you know, is a maybe it's a quest item. Quest items can't be removed. Maybe it's cursed. Cursed items can't be removed. Whatever those are, all the mechanics that you have. Then you have two more inventory methods, `equip` and `unequip` to a slot. So, I want inventory to know about equipment slots, and those, like `add` and `remove`, `equip` and `unequip` items from a particular slot, and they do not fail. So, they have the equivalent `can equip`, `can unequip` because, you know, maybe it's a cursed item and once you wear it, you can't unwear it. Maybe it's a class-specific item, so you're not allowed to equip it based on your class. These are things that the inventory should know about because these are system mechanics. You want to keep mechanics as clean as possible. This is why you keep all the UI stuff out of it.

Now, there may be data that is stored in items, like individual items may contain UI-related data that they neither use nor understand. For example, if you make a grid inventory, you may store the grid location in the item, so every item knows what its grid location is. This is only used by UI, and the mechanics here neither access that data nor have any idea what that data is. But I'm just saying, the items still can have that data on them, like they have weight or flags for whether they're cursed or class-specific, great. But the mechanics won't use it.

And then, before I finish, the final things that inventory mechanics may have are what I call the utility functions that don't have anything to do with adding, removing, equipping, unequipping. Things like give me the total weight of all the items I've equipped or give me the total weight of all the items I'm carrying or give me the total value of all the items I'm carrying. You might even want to write one like give me the total value of all the items of this type, you know, weapons, armor. You can do whatever you want, and this is where it should be done.

Now, now that you have that, that is your inventory component. It is a thing you can add to objects that lets it have an inventory because you may want to add it to containers, and then you can have a bunch of different kinds of containers. And the reason you did that as its own component is whether the container is lockable or not is part of the container; it's not part of the inventory. So, if you want to make shelves or a chest, those are all containers. Shelves aren't lockable, chests are if they have a key associated with them. The container knows about the key; you don't have to put that in the inventory mechanics. There's simply a component on the container saying, and here's how I have, you know, here's how things are put in me.

Similarly, creatures can have the inventory component, and that can be put on things like containers that you can loot, um, people you can pickpocket, vendors you can buy and sell from, and the vendors may use a different inventory component for what they sell versus what they're carrying. Um, this is why sometimes when you play games, you find a secret hidden chest that contains the shopkeeper's sellable inventory.

What I like about doing it this way too is you, when the object gets that component, it can call a function saying, "I don't have like equipable slots," so now the inventory system knows, okay, if anybody calls `can equip` item to like helmet slot or armor slot, I just, on `can equip`, I always return false, no such slot. And that way, when a container gets an inventory component and initializes it, usually by saying, "Here's how, here's the total weight of items I can carry or the total number of items I can carry," it will also tell it whether or not to turn those slots on. So, I still want the inventory system to handle all that, but this is how the object it's on can tell it, oh, and here's how I want you to handle some of the inventory functions.

So, finally, now we get to UI, and here, the main reason I keep these separate is, it's besides super clean code, is very, very frequently, the inventory mechanics are going to be coded by a different programmer

 who is doing the inventory UI, especially on big games where you have specialists. A user interface specialist may not write any of the code for the system he's creating the user interface for. This is true for inventory, character creation, character maintenance, level up, whatever. The UI person is writing; he probably didn't write the mechanics system. He just wants a very clean API into that system.

So, now, what do we do in the user interface for inventory? So, it knows the mechanics, so it knows it can call `add`, but `add` knows nothing about the UI. So, it's the UI that has to pay attention to other `can add` conditions. For example, the player wants to drop an object in their inventory. If it's a grid, maybe they have to drop it on a slot that's already empty. That's something the UI would handle, and if the player tries to drop it on something, the UI decides whether or not it's supposed to say no, you can't drop that, or if it drops it and picks up the object that's there, or if it drops it and displaces the object that's there one over. That's all UI's decision. Ultimately, what would happen, once they determine that it can be dropped in for no reason, the UI can determine, then it calls `can add` for the inventory system, and if that says it can be added, then they add it and put it into that slot.

So, this means the UI handles all the UI-related stuff. So, once it's in the grid, if you have like auto-sorting, like you can press a button and, you know, put all the objects in of a particular, show the objects in a particular type, and if you want it sorted, like not just being displayed but you actually want them arranged that way, the UI would handle that, and it can call that function in the items that says, "Hey, I need to store some um data for you, like a grid location," and the item will get that information. But remember, mechanics knows nothing about that, doesn't care about that field on the item; we'll never use it.

What I love about this is, this means the UI knows about the mechanics, but mechanics don't know about UI. So, this brings up one issue that every programmer will then wonder about when they have to start implementing this, is how can the UI handle things about the things that happen in the encumbrance, for example? Um, if you go to add an item, it would encumber the player. It's easy in the inventory UI. When it calls `can add`, and it says yes, and you could also call `Total` and do all the comparison and all that, you could do it that way. But you're going to have to do that. You have to remember you have to do that every time, anywhere in the system calls an `add`. If it's a script, if it is a um, another part of the system besides the inventory UI, for example, let's say you have um a button the player can press that just picks up everything that's off the ground. So, it doesn't bring up any UI. It just goes, if there's any objects on the ground around here, just add, add them into my inventory. All those places that call add will also have to call to see if the encumbrance has been exceeded.

A better way I like to handle this is with events where whenever the mechanic system, I mean, it knows you're adding something, it can look at the total weight, it can call the encumbrance because these are all mechanics level things. It can say, "Oh, you pick something up, and it exceeded your encumbrance. I'm going to throw an event, encumbrance limit exceeded on player." Then anybody who wants to listen to that event can listen for it and handle it if they want. Maybe there's a message line at the bottom of your eye that just goes, "You're now encumbered." Maybe if you have the inventory UI open, as soon as you pick up that item, maybe you want to display that it's going to encumber you if you add it. What's great about this is the encumbrance system or the mechanic system doesn't have to know all the places in the UI that may care about the player getting encumbered. It just goes, "Hey, this event, this item was added in, and the player's encumbered. Do throw the event." Inventory UI can listen to it; the main HUD can listen for it, and they can handle the event. And then the event can be one of those things where if the inventory UI has already handled it, then it can eat the event, so it doesn't go up to the HUD, and the HUD handles it, so you see the message come up twice. What that's what love about events is you can decide who sees it in what order and how it gets handled, and you don't clutter up the mechanics layer having to know about UI and who's going to display this error message. It doesn't care. It returns reasons you can or cannot add or drop or equip or unequip an item. It throws events for things like exceeding a weight limit, and it doesn't care. It's done its job. That keeps the mechanics super clean and also very much in line, probably with what your designer will write in the docs. Keeps the UI very clean because let's say you're playing the game, and a bug comes up and says, "Hey, I picked up objects that were too heavy, and I didn't see a message about it." You can go, "Oh, the inventory listens for that message, but the HUD doesn't. I'm going to add the HUD as a listener for that event as well." And if the inventory doesn't handle it, the HUD will, and that handles this weird case where you get in a dialogue with someone, and they give you an item, and it encumbered you, and because it wasn't, you know, it didn't happen to the inventory system, the player didn't know. Nope, they know as soon as that item gets added in, and the add triggers that encumbrance event, something sees it and goes, "Ah, I need to tell the player they're encumbered now."

So, that is how I generally structure my code, and I hope that makes sense, and I hope greenya 84 specifically, that answered your question.

https://youtu.be/ltO_rMJJdHE?si=9c_UJhsZfNUnwBuL

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim. Today, I want to talk about combat-like technical how-to code combat kind of thing. Like, I'm going to talk data structures and event handling. I wasn't going to do this, but I've done some technical talks in the past, and people really liked it, and I was trying to think of what I could talk about that was general enough that it would be applicable to a lot of you, but at the same time really interesting, and I hit upon the combat stuff because a whoa, okay, maybe I should start editing. I'm gonna leave that in there. Yes.

I want to talk about combat because A) every RPG has combat, and B) I did this a bunch of different ways. I did it one way for Bar Tail Construction Set and another way for Fallout, even though they were both turn-based, and then another way for Arcanum, and I finally settled on this method which I really like. For the programmers out there, it's one based on a manager for combat data structures, which I call combat packets, and then an event handler.

So why did I do it this way? Why did this become my favorite? Because making the packets global and having them controlled by a manager meant there was far less memory fragmentation because things are going to be requesting these packets a lot and freeing them up a lot. And as I'll explain as I go through it, a lot of things want to see these packets more than just the attacker, so making it something that exists outside of the attacker that can be referenced and passed around just makes things a lot easier.

I use the event handler because a lot of independent systems often want to know about these events, and through this combat packet, can be easily passed all the information they'd ever want to know. Of course, all the different combat routines want to know, but so does UI, so does the sound system, and those are independent of combat but often need to know information like who's the attacker, who's the victim, what's the victim's armor, what is the weapon that's being used in the attack, so it can decide how to display things in the UI and how to make sounds.

So, I'm going to walk through how I did this in, I think, everything after Arcanum. So let's start. First of all, there's a starting event where some attacker decides, "I want to do an attack." Maybe it's a turn-based system, and it becomes their turn. Maybe it's a real-time system, and the AI said, "Hey, it's time to do an attack." Maybe a cooldown happened, maybe another event happened that hit them like, "Hey, you were just attacked by somebody. What do you want to do?" "I want to attack back."

This is the point where the attacker asks the combat manager, "Please give me a combat packet," and the manager goes, "Here you go." The manager is the one that controls the memory for it, probably initialized it before it turned it, passed it over, so everything is appropriately initialized to a zero/null/nothing value.

During that start event, that's when the attacker is going to fill in as many fields as he already knows about. Now, the packet has fields for like, who's being attacked. There's a target array, keep in mind. And I'm being very careful. The target might be a creature; it might be a location because you throw a fireball at a location, and then it hits a bunch of targets.

So what I usually had was a target field, which could be an object or location, and then victims, which was an array of objects of everything that got hurt. There are other fields on this packet like what's the full amount of damage that got rolled by the attack, what was the damage done to each target, some flags we need to keep about the attack state. Those will be filled in as we go along.

As I said, the target might be an object or location, but that object might not be a creature. You might be throwing fine trap or open lock, so the object might be a creature, or it might be a chest, or door, or a lock, or trap. So you have to use data structures. You might want to use a union, the programmers, or you might have a generic object pointer that can point to a creature or a door or an object.

So here at the start, you fill in whatever you want to, whatever you know. You don't know all of it. For example, maybe the attacker knows who they want to attack; like, they know that this person just hit me. I want to attack them, but they don't know what ability they want to use. So there may be a function saying, "What ability I have available to attack this attacker, this person? I'm the attacker." Or you may already decide what ability you want to do, but now you want to know where to throw it.

For example, you may have a wizard NPC who basically casts Fireballs into the combat every time his cooldown happens. So cooldown happens, and he knows it's time for him to throw a Fireball, but where to throw it? So there's probably a function called saying, "If I threw this spell, where would I throw it? Or who would I target?" Sometimes you may need to decide both. Like in a turn-based combat, it's your turn now. Who do you want to attack? What spell, what ability do you want to use?

There may be a method for deciding both, where you go, "What should I do?" And it may recommend a person to attack, and then you can say, "What ability should I use?" Or it may say, "I think it's time for you to use this ability. Who should I use it on?" So you may have all three of those methods available for this ability: "Who do I attack? I'm attacking this person. What ability I want to use?" or "Hey, just tell me what to do."

So the attacker fills in whatever they can already do on that packet. I'm also going to note for optimization purposes, here's where you do anything that's expensive, and I'll talk about that later. If you do something frequently and expensive to calculate, you do it here. But like I've said in another video, you optimize later.

So at this point, the attacker's done, and it tells the combat manager, "Ah, here's my field and attack packet. Let's go." Basically, events get queued up. There is an attack begin event. This is where the animation for the attack starts, maybe a sound happens, maybe the skill roll, maybe it's determined here whether he hits or not because maybe he does a slightly different animation when he misses, or maybe the weapon can jam, and you have to know that before anything starts. Maybe not, maybe the skill happens when the actual hit happens on the target.

There may be an event for projectile launch because remember, if you have a gun or a bow, its animation begins, and there's a particular time in the projectile actually goes. Notice that that projectile launch may be an event on the animation, which is another reason to use combat packets. All the animation event will do is come back and tell the attacker, "You're playing an animation, and this event just happened,"

 and you know that event is, "I've got to create a projectile for my attack." Well, guess what? You have this packet lying around, and it's got you as the attacker, and it has the weapon you're using to attack or the ability. You know what you can figure out what to make. You do that, so you create a projectile. Maybe another sound gets fired.

A lot of people are listening to these events. Now there's an attack in progress. There may be some regular method that gets called every tick, every frame, to see if a projectile should be moved, if you need to check on its progress. You know, to maybe it hits something, or maybe it's supposed to make a sound as it goes along. Again, another reason that that packet should not be on the attacker, that it should be accessible to anybody because here's a frame rate or a heartbeat-based method that's being called that may not be on the attacker.

So the projectile gets moved, the sword gets swung, these things happen. You may, maybe the person has a globe of invulnerability around them that you actually stop before the hit of the attack, that you stop early. This is where you check something like that.

So then, finally, another event that happens is the attack is hit. Now you may or may not know whether it's successful. Like I said, you may not, you may have rolled it earlier, or you may not. This is where you'd roll it. You have events that you call on the attacker, "Your attack hit." You have events that you call on each target. Again, a good reason this packet isn't on the attacker. "Hey, you were just hit by this attack." Those individual targets may decide here's how much damage was done, but I have this damage resistance, or I have to roll a saving throw. This is where all that's done.

Another reason to have this in a packet is some spells or abilities may have something unusual, like it's an area of effect, and there's a chance one person in it gets stunned, or it stuns one up to three people in the group. This is where you kind of have to have a packet so that you can decide, do those roles or whatever, and then up a counter or set a flag in that packet so that once it's reached that limit, nobody else gets stunned, or whatever the effect is going to be.

Or if you determine that it's an attack miss, you may just call a function attack miss, or you may send out another event because other things want to know that it was a miss. Miss, maybe your UI does something different on a miss than a hit, or there's a different sound that's needed. Again, the attacker gets the miss event, and every target that could have been hit but was missed gets that event. Or if it's like a fireball, and some people made their save, and some didn't, some of those targets will get, "You were hit by the fireball," and the other gets, "You were missed by the fireball." So they all know that.

Then there's an attack finishing event, which again is a frame rate based. Maybe the projectile that missed keeps moving, maybe an animation has to be completed, maybe there's something that gets triggered by the hit that needs to play out. That's where that's done.

Finally, there's another event, attack completed. Everything's over, the attack is over. This is when this event gets happened. This is things that tell event abilities, "Your cooldown can start. You were just used. Your cooldown can start now." This is also where the packet gets released back to the manager. Maybe it reinitializes it before it puts it away. Maybe not. I usually initialize it when I need it, but it sticks it back on the queue of, "Here are packets available for me to hand out again."

This is the kind of stuff I did when memory was important, but if you're using something like Unity, and you don't use a packet manager like this, and you just make a new one whenever you feel like it, and you free it up whenever you feel like it, eventually, like, you can force garbage collection on Unity, but if you don't do it frequently enough, it will decide to do it on its own, and it's going to decide to do it in a time you don't want. So maybe it's not when you're loading a level where no one will notice a hiccup of a tenth of a second, it might do it in the middle of a big attack animation where that hiccup is noticeable, or your frame rate takes a dump because it decides to spend, you know, 100 milliseconds doing a garbage collection. This is why I always try to do that stuff myself. I'm not going to leave it to Unity or Unreal to do that for me.

Also, I mentioned optimization. I may think of places to optimize while I'm doing this, but I, you do optimization afterward. One thing I mentioned was, let's say there is something that in the attack packet that's kind of expensive to calculate, maybe it's what the target's armor is, and you need to look it up because the sound system looks it up to decide what sound to play because a sword on leather sounds different than a sword on plate mail, maybe it's the combat resolution itself that says, "I need to know what the damage resistance was on the victim's armor." Maybe of the 15 or so events that this packet flows through, 10 of them are looking up the victim's armor. You may, during the optimization phase, go, "That's expensive. I will look it up once in combat start and store it." But maybe of those 15 events, only three or four do a lookup, and it's not that expensive. Just look it up. That's why you save optimizations to a later, and you decide to do just the ones you need because if you over-optimize, you're not only wasting time that you could have spent fixing bugs that are important, but your optimizations may do nothing. They don't help the frame rate; they don't reduce memory. They did nothing.

So I just want to throw that in there because that's an example of how I do this. Anyway, to summarize, the way I've always loved doing combat is there's a combat packet that contains all the data about a single attack of an attacker on one or more targets that gets created by a combat manager who handles it independently of any of those attackers or targets, can be referenced by all the events, and the event handlers happen all the handle all the stages that that attack goes through. Anyway, took me years to figure that out. I used to do it like in with it, much more non-event-based code, very deterministic coding. That was a mistake. This is the way I do it now.

So that was a bit of a technical discussion. Hope people like it. Hope people like listening to it. I can do more of those. Let me know.
Title: 
Companions

Youtube Link:
https://youtu.be/-qX1pJLDMEI?si=VM-HM89TFZVEfoaZ

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim, and today I want to talk about companions. I've got a lot of questions about companions and how I feel like they should be used in RPGs, and I don't have a simple answer, which is why I put off answering this for such a long time. And I've gotten so many different questions from different people that I will try to cover them all in this one video. So, it covers whether or not I think companions should be in games, and how many there should be, and are they controllable, and what's their involvement in the quest line, and blah blah blah. So, let's just dive in.

There's a lot of topics here. Companions are a nuanced topic.

### Controlling Companions

Let's start with whether or not they're controllable. In general, in isometric games, I lean towards them being controllable, that once they enter the party, yes, you control them. Didn't do that in Fallout, but after, or Arcanum, but after I did it in Temple, I kind of liked that the player had that kind of agency because it doesn't feel good when you die and you wish someone in your party had just done one thing different. However, in first person, for a lot of different reasons, I prefer first-person games not to have controllable companions, not the least of which is it's really hard to make a control scheme that feels good with that. Plus, if you're especially if you're playing in real-time, you've you're going to have to either pause to issue orders. It's just, it's a lot harder.

Now, if you're going to do controllable companions, then you have to answer the question of is there now still a main player in the party. And by main player, I'm like, is there a character that represents the player, a player character, or is the entire party the player character? In Temple, the entire party, well, the ones you made, not the NPCs you recruited, the four that you made are the player character. If any one of them is alive, the game continues. In other games, there's a main player character, and then the companions come on, whether they're controllable or not, are not the main character. It gets confusing in games where the player character is just one of a party of fully controllable companions, and then somehow they're special. But I like that, and here's why. I like for one of the characters in your party to be you. That's who you were thinking of as you, and you made them, you created them, all their attributes, and their skills, and their perks, and anything that goes into them, and that's you. So, I like it where that character is special in a couple of ways: one, if you die, it's game over, and two, when you talk to people, you're the one doing the talking. Yes, you can get charisma speech-based companions. They assist your talking, and I'll talk about that. They're not going to though do the talking. Every you're the one who's doing it. In other words, think of the main player character as the one who drives the main story. You might be the chosen one, you might have just fallen into a storyline, but you're the one. That way, you can swap companions in and out, but you can't swap the main player character in and out. That's what makes him special.

### How Many

So, how many of these companions do I like having? There's how many you have in the party versus how many that exist. I prefer to have two to four companions that you can add into the party but three to six that you can pick from. And the reason I like doing this is I like to have a wide range of companions, and I get to talk about this in terms of what they add to the game in both gameplay and narrative, but you can't have all of them at once for a few reasons. One, I like that you have to choose, and I also like that you don't have this like, I don't want you to have eight or 10 things you're controlling in combat at once. And by the way, once you go that way, you're pretty much guaranteeing you're going to have to be turn-based. It is easier, I think, to have companions in a turn-based game because it's their turn now. I do the companion. You can do it in real time with pause, but a lot of them are going to be running around doing what the AI thinks is best, and then you occasionally intervene and say no, do this. And it gets really complicated when you try to do that with like 8, 10, 15 characters. So then, how many I like also depends on the traits. I want to give, usually, what I like to do with companions is gameplay-wise, they represent a mechanic archetype. So, you have a really good melee combat guy or a really good mage combat woman, or you have a really good sorceress, or you have a really good charisma guy. They're basically, you know, when you meet them, this is how they would be useful in my party. This is how they can fill in gaps. I need a healer, I need a tank, I need crowd control, I need a face. So, you meet these people. They represent an archetype.

Now, this gets us over to the narrative side of things, which puts us into quest lines, basically companion quest lines. So, companions usually come with their own quest line of some issue they're trying to resolve or something they were trying to do when you met them, and they still want to get it done even after they met you, and you can help them with theirs the same way they're helping you with yours. And this is fun. What I think about companion quests is they are side quests in the world that explore the world, not the main quest. So, companions don't come along and go, "Oh, you're killing the bad guy. I also want to kill the bad guy." I don't like that because that's your thing. I like side quests that are like, "I'm trying to recover this lost crown for my people. If you help me do that, I'll help you take down the bad guy." That's more interesting because now you find out about this whole faction, the problems they're having, their place in the world. You learn more about the world just by having this companion in the party, and that's what I love companions can do as part of their narrative. I love when companions talk with each other and interject in dialogues the player have or just make barks when they enter into areas because that's a great way of delivering lore without it feeling like a big lore hammer hitting you, like, "Oh, you have to read this book," or "You have to wade through 10 nodes of dialogue that you can't escape from." Companions can easily add background lore into your world without it feeling heavy-handed, so I like them to do that. But that means there's this constant tension between companions trying to add narrative, you know, lore, dialogue, personality to the game, and their gameplay needs, the fact that, well, this person

 was added because I really needed a good melee tank. And it's interesting because you often have to tell the narrative people, "This is what this is the role they're filling as a part of the party. Make sure that narrative doesn't conflict with this." If you end up saying, "This is our really, really powerful melee tank," and the narrative person says, "Well, they were raised by pacifist monks, and they don't like using weapons, and they're afraid of monsters, and all this," like, this is going to be a hard sell as this is my main melee tank. So, these have to work together.

There's a side thing here.

### Romance

I know a lot of people, even people on this channel, are really into romancing companions. I just never got into that because it strikes me as, first of all, in a lot of games, it feels like a weird add-on. It's like this person is wanting to do their side quest, and they've joined you and all this, and by the way, as soon as they get back to camp, they're like, "Ooh, you're hot." Also, to make it work with no matter how what kind of player character you've made, the male companions have to hit on you, the female companions have to hit on you, the different races that the companions can be have to hit on you. So, if there's a lizard man and there's a demon, and whatever, they all hit on you, and it just makes the world feel like, "Wow, the world is full of all these really horny people." If that's not what I want, then I don't want that to be reflected in the companions. So, often I'm just, "Go, let's take romance off the table," or if you really want it, there's one or two of them that are romanceable, and we're trying to cover the gamut with them, but the other ones are like, "Ooh, those guys are, you know, put a sock on it."

Anyway, that's how I kind of feel about their quest lines. I want their quest lines to explore the world, not them, not the main quest line. So, that's why I like them treated the way they are, with no romance. But then the final thing I wanted to talk about was playing without companions. There's a lot of people who don't like getting companions. They find them to be annoying or interruptive or disruptive to how they're seeing their gameplay going. So, I try to do the same rules for companions that I do for side quests, and that is, the main storyline is completable without any companions. None of them are required. None of them have a skill or an item that you absolutely need to do the main story quest. I'm not saying the main storyline will be easier without them. I mean, if you have a lot of companions, that's a lot of extra damage output, that's a lot of extra meat shields out there, but you should be able to finish the main storyline without a single companion, without ever picking up a companion, maybe without even talking to them, which means they don't have to be marked as essential. You can come across somebody who may want to join your party, and you can just kill them instead. That's what I like. The other thing I treat them with a side quest is if you want to play without a companion, they shouldn't come across as you feeling like you're getting a lesser experience without doing it. Um, and no matter what kind of build you're playing, you should meet companions that do complement you. If there's a bunch of just melee tanks out there, and you're a melee tank, you may feel like you don't want a companion because there's nobody who complements your skill. So, you should always run into companions that you'd want to get, that are really complementary to your skill set, but you should never feel like you have to get them. And because of that, I feel like games where there's a companion you have to pick up, even for a short time, they're forced into your party, whatever, tend not to like those. Um, and I treat this as different than games like Temple, where, you know, you're told you have to make four player characters because the game is balanced for four. I will tell you though, it is really hard to balance a game where companions are optional, and you can have a lot of them. We did two in The Outer Worlds because if we had made it three or four, it's really hard to make a game that's balanced where one person may be playing solo, and the other person may be one in a party of five, where there's four companions. So, the more companions you allow, the harder it is to balance if you want to let them choose companions. Now, if you're going to force companions into the party, then okay, you know, if by the time the player leaves a certain area, there's got to be, they got to have a full party of four or five, much easier to balance.

So, think about that if you're putting companions in your game. In fact, I think that may be all my thing.

So, recap: whether they're controllable depends on the game type, isometric versus first person, turn-based versus real-time. How many is variable, how they interact with the quest line, and what versus what kind of traits they have, and then I like to have the option that you can play solo, and you don't need any companions at all.

So, that's, I think, all of my high-level thoughts on companions. So, you can see it varies by game, but in general, I have very consistent thoughts that I've created over time. So, some of my earlier games don't quite meet this. If I were to redo them today, I might do them a little differently, but that's a hard thing about companions now.

So, I hope this answers all of the companion questions.

Creeping Normality.md

https://youtu.be/N3mX9ySWz6o?si=vDsb8s7p5mz6edta

Hi everyone, it's me Tim. Today I want to talk about creeping normality. It's not the name of my favorite band, it's not the name of a new game company I'm starting. It is a term that means getting major change made to something in small, tiny increments. This is not the same as slippery slope, which is an argumentative fallacy where people assume that if you let one little thing in, it will lead to major unintended consequences. Creeping normality is a deliberate thing that people do where some limits have been defined on like a min and a max of something, and then you push or other people push on the limits of those, usually the upper limit, trying to get something just past it. And if they do, that moves the limit, and then they do it again, and it moves the limit, and it does again. That's why it's called creeping normality.

In politics, this has been called the Overton window, which means politicians often see certain topics as being too conservative or too liberal for them to discuss with their base, but over time that Overton window can shift. Often by introducing things that are near one end, introduce a pretty conservative bill that's at the limit of what people accept or a very liberal bill at the limit of what people accept, and when that gets accepted, you wait a year or two and then you can push something more. The Overton window is a little different, that's why I went with creeping normality.

Creeping normality is something that I've seen in game development a lot, and that's why I wanted to talk about it here. When, um, every game I've worked on has had this. I particularly see it though when I'm in charge of the design. So, I saw it on um, well, Fallout, I was kind of the last word on the design, and then saw it in Arcanum, saw it in Temple, saw it in um, WildStar, saw it in Outer Worlds. So, I'll talk, I'll give some examples for those of those, but what I'm saying is tends to happen, and if you work in a group, you will probably see this happen in your group.

A designer has an idea and they really want it in the game, even though it doesn't quite fit. They do one of two things: they'll modify their idea so it's just within or just outside the limit and they're trying to get that limit changed, or more frequently what I've seen people do is they're pushed for something near the limit that's not their idea until it gets accepted, then the limit can be moved up a little, and maybe they'll do something else, and then the limit will get moved again, and they suddenly say well here's my idea for this thing that they knew wouldn't have been accepted six months, eight months before because now they've normalized what or they've changed what's normalized in the game.

I've heard this referenced by some of the old writers who worked on The Simpsons. If you watch the first season of The Simpsons, Homer's not as dumb as he has as he is mean. And in the interview I saw, I think it was within with Conan O'Brien, they said somebody, some designer wrote in something, and the producer pushed back and said no that's too stupid for Homer to say. But what happened was something else dumb was said for Homer and it got a lot of good feedback, so then when they introduced what you know, again, what they wanted to say earlier, it suddenly wasn't too dumb, and they were getting a lot of laughs on it. So, suddenly Homer saying all these dumb things, so Homer shifted from the kind of mean, aggressive, angry father into just really stupid father, and that's a good example of creepy normality.

But I want to talk about what I've seen happen in with creepy normality in my own games. Um, Fallout is the one I want to use because a lot of you play Fallout. In the very first game, we had Mr. Handy, we had the uh Robo Brains. This was something that we saw as what a robot should be like in Fallout, a very big chunky, clunky, treads or floating on you know, a thruster, very mechanical, very simplistic, no chance that this thing you think this thing is sentient. It's a very robotic robot. We used Forbidden Planet as a touchstone, that was Robbie the robot. But there was a programmer, who loved a designer, who loved Terminator and Terminator 2, and he really really wanted that kind of skinny endoskeleton robot, and he kept trying to introduce it and we kept pushing back, and I finally had to tell him no, that is not Fallout, it doesn't fit the fall of aesthetic.

And then later, the newer Fallout came out, and they had endoskeleton bots in Fallout 4, you run into one right when you go to Diamond City, Nick, the detective bot. Then you find out they have synths, which are supposedly undetectable. It's kind of vague and needed, test them, like couldn't you just cut someone's arm off and see the robot part inside, but it didn't matter at this point, endoskeleton robots have been normalized into Fallout. This means the limit's been pushed, now more modern tech can be added, especially because if you look at what the Institute added into Fallout 4 with much more modern tech, you can point to that and go well there could be even more modern tech than that at some point. If this continues, it really won't look like Fallout anymore, it'll look like some other game, but it will happen slowly, and that's why often I found as the game director, I had to be the bad guy and go no, we're not going to do this, no, because you want to keep those limits constrained so your game has a theme and a tone and a style.

A perfect example of this, and I'm glad I already talked about the design dock for Arcanum 2. That design doc was an amalgam of several designers wanting to make a sequel for Arcanum 2. And there, I mentioned that there was an ore that was supposed to be the goal of or came to the original goal was find Franklin Payne, but then it turns out hey there's this crazy ore underground that you can use to combine magic and tech into one item. I never liked that, I argued against it back then, I said this tension between magic and tech is the whole point, it's the whole crux of of Arcanum. We talked about how it's like a Lord of the Rings 14th century vaguely fantasy campaign that has been thrust into an industrial age, and the fact that magic and tech do not combine is what makes it interesting. You have elves that are like very anti-tech, and you have dwarves they're like we love tech but we're going to keep it to ourselves, and they have humans who want to spread both everywhere. It was an interesting tension, and I thought that ore undermined it. But what worse, and I didn't have the terminology then, was introducing that ore is a form of creepy normality. Once that ore is introduced, now you can have a gun that can be magic, or maybe the bullets can be magical shot from the gun. You can have spells that uh

 maybe duplicate technology or work with technology. You can make technological enhancers you can put on your hands that make your spouse do more. To me, I was like we're gonna we're gonna change the nature of what made Arcanum special and unique, so that was a huge concern of mine.

Bloodlines had something similar. When I came on board two years after it had started, I was it was on the tailwind of wanting to put Kane, the original vampire in addition to this game into the game, and because Kane was supposedly like super powerful and always there working in the background. At one point, it we were going to make it obvious that Kane was involved in the events of Bloodlines. We pulled back from that thankfully because I think that not only makes the player agency seem less involved but putting Kane in there as one of the most historical and most powerful figures kind of shifts now what can be in you know, a Vampire: The Masquerade computer game. Are you gonna start putting some of the elder, you know, vampires in? Um, are you gonna put in the uh, what are they called, the Nephilim or whatever, the old really old things are? It basically starts pushing the nature of the game away from here's a player character Vampire who's just trying to figure his way among the clans. It makes the issues too big and too broad and changes the nature of what the game is.

Interestingly, I wish I had known about creeping normality because when I was at WildStar, I could never get a read on what people wanted to do. When I was a programming director, it seemed like anything, anything went. When I took over as design director, part of the problem was every time I tried to define limits, they would get pushed back by people at my peer level or higher, so it was hard to control the game, it's hard to give it a good theme, a good feel, a good you as the player should, should within a few hours of playing a game, go okay I get this game, I know what is and isn't part of this game. I mean it would be really weird if you were playing Skyrim and a flying saucer landed. It would be weird, you know, deploy playing, you know, a Deus Ex and suddenly people start casting magic. It's good to have limits, it's good to have defined limits in games.

In fact, that gets me into what why I wanted to talk about creepy normality, what does this mean for game design and especially if you're making a game. I very, very much encourage you to set hard limits. You can even write them down, remember when I said you can define your goals for the game, that's a good place to write down what your limits are and say this is what is in this game and this is not what's in this game. If you, you have to do that because if you don't, two things can happen: you can overscope the game, which as I've talked about in other videos, overscoping leads to too many features, too much content, and creepy normality which is anything anyone thinks of belongs in the game. But also, without limits, you end up with when I talked about perfect is the enemy of good. Without limits, you can end up with people really wanting to make something fantastic in the game which doesn't even really belong because they're pushing a limit. It takes a lot of work to get that thing working in the game and feeling like it belongs, so it takes a lot of extra work, and the work you spend trying to smash that feature in that's slightly beyond what your limits are, or time you could have been spent making the game better.

So, I see creeping normality as a dangerous thing in computer game design and something you need to keep an eye on, and I think if there's ever time for a game director to be heavy-handed, I think it's with the limits that have been set for the game. Define them early, get everybody to agree to them, and then your job is to police that and make sure everything stays in that limit. It's okay for someone to push up against it, but say no to anything that goes past it, and I think that will help you make a better game. So, I hope you all now understand and appreciate creeping normality.

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim. Today I want to talk about crunch. There's been a lot of people saying a lot of things about crunch, people been saying a lot of things about crunch for decades. I don't know how much I can add to this other than my own experience with crunch in both being on crunch that was imposed on me, being on crunches that I imposed, being on crunches that were caused by other people, being on crunches at high cost. So, it gives me a pretty big perspective on crunch.

And let me just define crunch first of all. Crunch is the extra work, usually at the end of a game, but it could occur before making a demo or a conference. It's a crunch that happens when the game's development gets behind schedule, so you have to work hard, extra hours, weekends to make up and get the game back on schedule.

Now, to me, one of the most annoying things I hear, and I'm going to be very careful how I say this, I hear this a lot: "Crunch is always the result of bad management." No. No. If people are saying this, I find that they're usually just repeating something they've heard somewhere else, or they have so little experience in the game industry that they do not know what they're talking about. They may get one game under their belt, they saw the crunch one on that and they're like crunch is bad and it's Management's fault. No. Here, I'll rephrase it: Crunch is usually the result of bad management. There, I think everybody can agree to that. But saying it's always the cause pushes it too far, and I'll go into it, but yes, let me just say right now the biggest cause of crunch is poor management. And it this can be management in a lot of different ways. It could be the game was overscoped by the designers and the lead designer did not, you know, clamp down on this overscoping. It could be bad estimates done by developers that weren't caught by the leads. It could be failure in production to spot bad schedules at the start of a game, you know, like things have been misestimated or time was not allotted for certain things at all. Or while the game is under underway, production didn't spot areas that were falling behind early enough to do anything about it. And that all that leads to Crunch, and I admit that happens a lot. I would say that a lot of crunch, anywhere from a lot to most crunch is caused by those factors.

But, there are so many other reasons I've seen games crunch beyond bad management, which is why bristle when people go all crunches caused by bad management, and I'm like, whoa, you have not scratch the surface of why crunch is happening.

So, I'm going to walk through some of the things I've seen, and hopefully it'll give you a picture of why crunch happened so much in the game industry. First of all, developers take a variable amount of time to complete their assignments. I personally have taught University level computer science classes, and I say University level because these students were vetted in many cases better than a game industry employees vetted. I mean, these were people, these were students who, they all had to, you know, they probably did well in high school, they had to do well on an SAT test and achievement tests, they had to get into the university with whatever the universities admission process was, and then they had to take all the prerequisites for the class you're teaching. Even then, I would find students with vastly different programming backgrounds, and expectations and recall of previous classes taken. So when you gave them assignments, you would find that different students would take wildly different amounts of time to get their code done. And the end result, whether it's the quality of the code, the quality of the overall piece of code like in its output, or the quality of the code itself, like clean code, how many bugs were in and all that, those were wildly different, and often not proportional to how much time the person spent. I saw people turn in assignments early and it was gorgeous. I saw other people turn in assignments late that were wonderful, and then I saw a bunch of bad stuff turned in early, I had a bunch of bad stuff turned in late. So, I quickly learned at University, there doesn't seem to be much of a correlation between time and quality. And later, when I, you know, started talking with artists at these, and you know, I started a company, Troika, with two artists, I remember talking to Leonard, he said that in his classes, it often took students a lot of different time to paint a portrait for an assignment. Sometimes the same student would take different amount of time on different portraits. So, it's hard to estimate that. So, I'm going to say good luck if you're a lead or producer, good luck estimating tasks or getting developers who can accurately predict how long that work will take. It doesn't happen very frequently.

Also, good luck getting a publisher to fund your reasonably scoped project. I see everybody complain, "This project wasn't reasonably scoped." You know what? Every publisher I've ever worked for, from the ones I enjoyed working for to the ones I did not enjoy working for, they all wanted a Ferrari, but they had the budget to buy a Toyota. And they have been the sweetest people about it, like, "Well, don't you want to make a good game? Don't you want your game to score well? You know, your royalties are going to be based on how good this game is." So, they talk you into putting in more and more features. Go back and look at some of my previous videos, I told you in Temple, I tried to pull out classes that would have been and did at a length of time to the project we did not have, and it was either, "Well, put paladins, Druids, and bards in, or don't make this game at all." Maybe I should have walked away from it. I didn't. I've also been told by my bosses on contracts I didn't have any involvement in, that this is the one I love, "Figure out how to do a dollar of content for a quarter." Okay, I'll try to, but them in the quality level is lower, or the length of the game is shorter, they're like, "Wait a minute." And I'm like, "That's what the budget was, compares to things of similar budget."

Also, and I've talked about this in different videos, good luck telling a developer no on a feature idea they have without you becoming a bad guy. And by the way, this situation for a lead or director is a complete trap, and I'll tell you why. Let's say you say yes to their feature. If the game ends up overscoped, you're the one held accountable, not them. They'll even go, "Oh, I didn't realize, you know, it would lead to this problem in the game. You should have said no, you're the one with more experience." But if you say no, not only are you the bad guy because, you know, "You never say yes to my ideas," but you might produce a game that has an issue because of that feature would have,

 that new feature would have solved the problem with the existing feature it replaced. Or maybe the game is now too short because the feature idea would have added more content. Either way, you're the bad guy. So, once the game is underway and people have ideas for new features, it doesn't matter whether you say yes or no, you will end up being the bad guy, unless you somehow have perfect oracular foresight, which I've never met anyone who did.

Also, on when I'm talking about team members, good luck with developers who hate pointless meetings but have no trouble talking endlessly in them, or come to your office and talk for hours trying to convince you that a feature should be put in. See my previous point about this is a trap. But yes, I've been caught in my office for hours by people trying to explain that something they want to put in the game should be added, and I'm sitting there thinking that I don't think it belongs in the game. But again, it's a trap. If I say yes and we've overscoped, I'll be held accountable. If I say no, they're gonna stomp off and tell everybody else who will hear them how awful I am at listening to them. So, good luck with that.

Good luck avoiding all the bugs in your game's design, much less bugs in the code and the art. Wait, you didn't know that design and art could have bugs in them? That adding a feature could cause an imbalance in the game that would then tie up your designers and programmers? Or that a piece of art could go in the game that's flawed and again tie up artists and programmers? Well, that can happen. So, good luck.

Also, good luck designing a fallback for every single design feature in your game that either doesn't get implemented in time, doesn't get implemented to quality, or doesn't get implemented bug-free enough to actually end up in the final game. You think you can just cut out a feature, but sometimes you can't because features are all interconnected. Cutting out a feature may wreck everything. If you've already designed your economy, for example, and then you decide crafting's not working, you cut it out, well, there went money sinks, there went rewards that, you know, for recipes and other quests that give you crafting recipes, there go a whole section of the game that you plan for the player to engage in, and it's now just gone. So, you just can't snip it out. So, you should have had a fallback for it. Good luck making a fallback for every single feature in your game because eventually you will need those fallbacks, and you won't be able to predict when the game ships what fallbacks you're going to need.

Oh, are you using a third-party engine or just third-party tools? Good luck getting them to fix bugs. It's sometimes like pulling teeth dealing with their support, or they tell you, "Oh, we fixed that, it'll be in the next revision." When will the revision be? "We don't know." Or if a new version comes out, good luck deciding whether or not to use it. Sometimes that version has a bunch of new features that would be great in your game, or fix bugs that would be great in your game, or introduce bugs that you don't want in the game. I don't think I've ever seen a new version of a game engine or tool come out that is 100 percent good or bad. It usually adds a bunch of stuff we wanted, fixed a bunch of stuff we were encountering, and introduces a bunch of bugs we're going to encounter. By the way, if their support ever tells you that a feature is in, and then you discover it doesn't quite work the way you were told, good luck getting that fixed. It's frequently the case that you grab a new version because you said, "Hey, there is this new feature in, and it's perfect," and then you start using it, "Oh, it doesn't quite work on your levels the way they said it would." They're implied to something you're doing wrong, and then you show what's going on, what the problem is, and they go, "Oh, we're trying to get that fixed," and you're back into waiting for the next revision to come out.

Managers themselves and directors, good luck learning to self-edit. Keeping your own self from wanting to add and change existing features is really hard. I mentioned that was one of the biggest problems with Arcanum. If we had an idea, it went into that game. That game was bursting with features it probably didn't need to. I know every time I talk about removing a feature, someone will comment, "But that's my favorite feature." I know, but all of the features didn't belong and didn't need to be in the same game, and that was the problem with that. But despite everything I just said, there's always people that think they can manage the chaos of game development. And I always wonder, do they think they can schedule for all the stuff I just mentioned? A lot of times when I ask them how they do it, they're these platitudes, "Oh, we're putting buffers. We'll have extra people ready to go in," and I'm always thinking, "You're gonna do all that and still come in on time and on budget?" I've never seen that happen, and the bigger the game, the less likely I've seen that happen because more of what I've just mentioned is likely to have happened in a bigger game.

And also, nothing I said above, not one thing, was hypothetical. I've seen every single one of those things happen in some game I was working on, some I wasn't in charge of, I was just doing code and going, "Hmm, I've seen that happen before. Feel sorry for those leads, but there's nothing I could do about it." It happened outside of something I was working on. I've also been a director and had these things happen and had people go, "Why didn't you foresee this?" I'm not a super genius, that's why I didn't foresee this.

So, all these things have happened, and yet, I still see people go, "It's entirely bad management." It's hard to wrap my head around a statement as general and disprovable as that. So, yes, let me just end this way: Crunch is often the result of bad management, but there are other reasons, and unless your funding source is deep and unquestioning, expect at some point while making a game, and the bigger the game, the more likely this is, to make a severe cut in the game, either removing features or removing content, or crunch. It's going to be one of the other. So, I think crunch can be reduced with better management, but it won't be eliminated. So, if we go forward with the idea, "Okay, crunch has to happen sometimes," if you just accept that, how can we make it better? And this is where, and I've thought this for years, and I've thought it before when it was really considered a dirty word, I actually think it's time for the game industry to get unions, mainly because unions help the people who were in the trenches get better pay for overtime, or get time off for that overtime, or other benefits that

 just make up for the crunch. I love that in the movie industry, for example, the people who do camera work, or lighting, or makeup, or whatever, if they're told they have to stay past eight hours, they get paid more for those extra times, plus there is an absolute limit to how long they can be kept, and they can't be called back really quickly. So, I think somebody said what it was once, it's like, once you leave, you have at least 11 hours before you can be called back on the set. I see nothing like that in the game industry. I see, and have been the person who's worked long hours, late hours, gotten four hours of sleep, and come back the next morning. I don't think that was a good way to work. I don't think it's sustainable. But I also think that pretending that a magic production scheduling wand will fix all these is insane. I think we need to instead accept that crunch will occasionally happen, and try to ameliorate how bad it is, try to make the crunch as short as possible, and try to compensate people for having to do the crunch.

I hope that makes sense. I hope that doesn't, you know, start off flame war, but I think that that is probably the most reasonable take on crunch I can come to after watching so many projects of so many different sizes in terms of team sizes and budgets be made. I just can't imagine a game being made with a flawless schedule, and unless it's so tiny that I don't even call it a game, I call it a toy, but even some of my toys have taken me a long time to do. It's game development's hard. I don't know what else to say. So, hopefully, crunch will get better in the future by either being shorter or better compensated, but I don't think it will ever go away.

Damage Numbers.md
Youtube Link:
https://youtu.be/GTMdWT8Lb9k?si=MKBxiv985LuMDQCy

Hi everyone, it's me Tim, and today I want to talk about damage numbers—yes, those little numbers that fly off of people when you hit them in games. Because that's actually an interesting topic to talk about, and I got asked a question about it. Zandatsu asks: 

"Damage numbers are a feature that I feel sometimes gets treated as being insignificant. If you have any stories about the specific implementation of a small thing like this and how all those little choices get made, I'd love to hear about it in a video. Are some things like this left entirely up to one person to implement, or is there always multiple people coming to a consensus over what works best? Are there things that feel unimportant during development but upon reflection should have been given much more thought in terms of their implementation? I feel like damage numbers may be one of those things."

You are right, damaged numbers are something that frequently, especially in my older games, got left to like, "Isn't it obvious we're just have a number fly up when they get hit?" Or, if we do that at all. I mean, Fallout and Arcanum had no such numbers. I believe we left it to, it was enough to display something down in the console window and maybe put a status effect under their health bar. Temple, I think, was the same way.

I would say that the first time I spent serious time on damage numbers was on Wild Star and revisited this for The Outer Worlds and really looked into exactly what we went there because combat is a big part of RPGs. You be spending a lot of time doing combat, and a lot of part of what a lot of time spent doing combat is doing damage to people. So spending a little time on this seemingly insignificant feature really does help, and also it's very easy to make mistakes with this.

I am still playing games today that I will have a character hit another character, and it says, say, 124. No, I didn't do 124 hit points of damage. I did 12 plus an additional four, but those numbers came up right next to each other, and it looked just like 124. So I still see those mistakes being made in major games today, and I think if you just sit back and come up with a good design, you can eliminate a lot of those problems.

Now, when I talk about making that design for damage numbers, you need a lot of people looking into that. At the very minimum, you need the artist who's going to do it, often they consider themselves FX artists. You need the system designer in charge of what the mechanics are for doing damage. You need your UX designer, you need a sound person there, and the programmer who's going to do it. And the reason you need all these people, and this is commonly turned into a strike team, is you need to know, hey, how is damage applied and what kind of damage is applied and how long does that damage last and keep applying? Because you may do damage from range attacks or from melee attacks or from hazards in the world. Some of them last, some of them put a dot, a damage over time, and keep doing damage, and you want to associate the damage with the thing that did it and show that it's it's it's keeps happening.

And one thing you can do with that is by how it looks, moves, is colored for you color seeing people, and how what they sound like. What we ended up doing on several of my games is a combination of font size, color, motion, and direction. So I'll walk through what we what we decided to do. The font size was based on the damage amount. Now, you can do that two ways. If it's a big damage amount, you can use a big font, and if it's a small damage amount, you can use a small font. Or, you can say Critical Hits always get done in a Big Font, and grazes get done in a small one, until regular damage is in the regular font. There are pros and cons to this. If you if you say Critical Hits always get a big number, but the person rolls a one for damage, and it quadruples to a four, it seems a little weird to see a big four happen. But of course, you want to convey that they got a critical visually. So some people are like, no, which is still be a big four 'cuz a big a big four from a critical should be treated slightly differently than a four from a regular damage attack. So you can go either way with that.

For color and motion, we base that on damage type, and I thought this was really cool because it really helps convey it. And because color and motion were used in conjunction, it tended to do two things. One, you don't have to worry about colorblind people because they can pick it up from the motion. And also, the because the color and motion will be different for damage different damage types, if you hit someone like I did for 12 physical plus four acid, those will have different colors and different motions. So those numbers will move away from each other, and you will see that it was a 12 and a four.

I'll give you some examples of what we did. So fire was orange and it wafted up above the person. So when they got hit for like 10 fire, it would go 10. Electricity was yellow and zigzagged off one side. So if you got hit by 10 electricity, it would go 10. If you got hit with acid, it was green and it dripped off of you. So it would go 10, and it would kind of stretch a little and go down. Physical damage was white and it just would go off out a direction, which was really cool because if you were burst attacked, which could happen like with a machine gun or something, you'd see lots of numbers flying off you like 5, 8, 7, 8, 2, six. And it was really cool because it looked the the person was usually also playing a reaction, so it looked really cool, and it conveyed that they were being burst attacked in a very visceral way.

On WildStar and on Outer Worlds, we put an entire team together for this. And like I mention, like I mentioned earlier, it had an artist and a programmer and a UX designer and a sound guy. We'd often put a specific producer on that to coordinate all of this because this actually took, this was a coordinated effort. That's why you needed a team to do it. Sometimes it'd even seat those people together on those teams. I know the artist and the UX designer frequently sat together so that they could work out the little details that always comes up when you're doing anything interface or HUD related. And we just found that if you sat them together, it kind of eliminated all that Communications overhead. So they didn't have to wait for that once or twice weekly meeting. Strike team meeting, they were in the same room, they could turn and go, "Hey, does this look look right?" or "Hey, did you want it to do this or this?" or "Is, are you sure this is the color you want 'cuz the RGB value is really close to another color you gave me?" So those things, it just eliminates things quickly. And the reason we put a specific

 producer on it is that producer could watch all those people who were involved and make sure that their schedules aligned. So if the system designer was putting those mechanics together, and the programmer was free to start coding it, you definitely want the UX designer and artist free too, to give him the details on exactly how that stuff was supposed to look.

So it was interesting that something that many people considered so insignificant, I do not, because it's a big part of combat. How you give information back, and most people look down at the console, but what's great about damage numbers is they're right there at the target that you're you tend to be looking at. And when it happens to you, you're often looking at yourself too, and it just reinforces whether or not you're taking a lot of damage or a little, what kind of damage you're taking, and how much damage without you having to go down to the console and go, "Oh, I stepped on a grenade trap," or "Oh, I got hit by a fireball."

So I think there's a lot of little things like this in games that most people when they're playing a game think is tiny and inconsequential, and it's not. A lot of time and thought went into it, and usually a group of people were involved in making it. But damage numbers are a perfect kind of encapsulation of that idea. So Zandatsu, I'm glad you asked, and I hope that answered your question.
Title:
Design Pillars.md
Youtube Link:
https://youtu.be/N7b7LFXBZ9M?si=-Oaq3F-T7XJWi8po

Hi everyone, it's me Tim. Today I want to talk about design pillars. This is something that I've mentioned several times in several past videos. I've seen a lot of comments from people asking me to explain them, kind of like what are they, how are they used, how do you write them. So, I thought I'd describe what they are and then, because they've changed over the years, I'm gonna give you examples of what Fallout's were and then what Arcanum's were and finally what The Outer Worlds design pillars were and you can kind of see for yourself how they changed over the years and how they were used.

So first of all, let me define design pillars. They are the high-level guidelines for making the whole game. Every aspect, the story, the system mechanics, the ads, if you look at the pillars, you have a good idea of what kind of game is being made, not just what the setting is and what the basic genre of the game is, but you have a good idea of what the intention is of this game. The pillars are the foundation upon which the entire game rests and because of that, you have to make these early. These are foundational. If you're making a game and two years in you decide to change design pillars, you've just changed the game and you have possibly invalidated all the work you just did in the last two years. So design pillars tend to be made as early as possible in the design process. I told you it goes setting, story, mechanics, certainly before you're done with mechanics you should have your design pillars, preferably before you even done with the setting.

Also, the entire team should accept and understand these pillars. They should have read them and they should agree with them, and not just the designers, the artists and the writers and the programmers, everybody working on this game should know what these pillars are, understand what they mean, and accept that that's the game they're making. Early on, when I made games either by myself or there's maybe me and another artist or maybe one other programmer, you didn't really need pillars. I think it's still wise for small teams to make them just so you can, it's very clear what game you're trying to make, and you can also share these with people say, "What are you making?" You can say, "Here are the pillars." It's great to, if you ever publish, or you're talking with journalists or whatever, it's great to share those pillars. But when teams were tiny, everybody just kind of got it. As teams got bigger, especially when you had people working on specialized things or people that weren't going to talk to everyone on the team every day, you kind of needed explicit pillars just so everybody agreed, everybody's on the same page.

Interestingly enough, I don't even think when we first made them, we didn't even call them pillars. I believe Fallout's was called The Vision doc, but then inside it listed what essentially were the pillars. Also, the Fallout one was huge, it was multiple pages long. The Arcanum one was a couple pages and I don't even think The Outer Worlds one filled an entire Confluence page, like a screen on Confluence. As I said, design docs have not become static either and as we went along, I mean they went from individual word docs to networked word docs that had tracking changes turned on to now we do everything in Confluence pages that are interlinked together.

So, let me start with Fallout's pillars. And I will go over those now. Remember, these weren't called pillars, these are part of the vision document. Brian Fargo asked me to write the Fallout Vision document late November, early December of '95. Because by that time, I had a team, a very pretty big team, and I think it was at least 20 people big by Interplay standards, and he said, "I want to know what the vision is for the game." And I wrote one, and he hated it. And I was like, and I tried again. I mean, I tried really hard on the second one, and he hated it. I was frustrated by then because I was like, "I don't know what he wants. I'm writing down what I think the vision is." And Chris Taylor knew I was frustrated. We'd come back from Christmas break, this is early January, he could tell I was frustrated. He goes, "Let me give a crack at it." And I said, "Please, you know, just give me something I can give him that we like and he likes." Chris wrote something up, we loved it.

Now, it's too long for me to read the whole thing, it's a really long document, and it's funny and it's got some dark humor in it too, but I will go over, just so you know, Fallout's vision statement listed 14 design pillars. And if you've played Fallout, you can tell me how close we came to achieving all of these pillars. I can tell you, some of them, maybe not so close, but I will go through them in order.

**Pillar one**: Mega levels of violence. We threw it up there right at the beginning. We wanted our game to be violent. Now, keep in mind, we said this explicitly in '96, and everybody knew that's what we were making. So, if later on anyone expressed surprise at how violent Fallout was, I wasn't having it.

**The second pillar** was that there is often no right solution. And it's interesting that he said this before the next pillar which is there will always be multiple solutions. Because I used to always say, "Hey, there's got to be multiple solutions to everything," except for side quests which I've talked about. But Chris also wanted to emphasize that sometimes there's no right solution, that there's only different ways of doing it that are shades of gray. You know, you can do it this way, but then these people are unhappy. You can do it this way, and these people aren't happy. You can do this third way, and everybody's unhappy. But there is no like correct way of doing it. That really, really resonated with the Fallout team.

**Fourth pillar**: Players' actions affect the world, and the world will react to the player. I think we did a really good job at that. The end slides are informed by that. We really didn't want the player to be able to leave the game without knowing, "Hey, you caused a lot of stuff. You caused some collateral damage on your rampaging around Southern California after a nuclear war."

**The fifth one** was that there should always be a sense of urgency. We wanted the player to feel like, "You know, I gotta do that. I gotta save my Vault. Oh no, I gotta take care of these mutants. Oh no, I gotta get rid of the Master." This is the pillar that everybody who wanted the timer in the game, the one that if you didn't get the water chip in 150 days, the game would end, they would appeal to pillar number five and say, "Hey, we have to have a sense of urgency." Personally, I thought that was too much, but you know, we obviously shipped with it, and then we patched it.

**The sixth pillar**: We wanted the game to be open

-ended, meaning that was a combination of we wanted to be able to go wherever you wanted, we want to be able to do what you wanted. The game just had to be able to handle that, and no matter how you played, the game would come up with an ending for it. It would have, you know, that's why we had end slides for you being dipped in the vat and joining the mutant army and made end slides for you cutting off all the mutants.

**The seventh pillar** was we always wanted the player to have a goal. Basically, we never wanted the player to not know what he should be doing, and that's why they're really only three main goals in Fallout: get the water chip, destroy the mutant army, destroy the master. You always know you have to be doing that. There may be quests that you're on, there may be side quests you're on, but you always know overarching what you're supposed to be doing.

**The eighth pillar**: The player has control over his own actions. We never wanted to take agency away from the player. We never wanted to tell the player, "Okay, right now, you have to be good. You have to be bad. You have to kill this person," you know, directly. I mean, some of our solutions about blowing up where the person happened to be, there was a lot of stuff where we often rejected quests because we're like, "I don't want to make the player do that," or, "I don't want the, when you just describe your quest idea, step three is and then the player does this." We just didn't like that.

**The ninth one** was interface. This is the one I'm like, we really felt strongly that we had to make a really good interface. We were concerned at the time with games coming out with really complicated interfaces. We knew our game was complicated. We tried to make it as simple as possible. We could have done a better job, but we had that as a pillar. We tried.

**The tenth pillar** were the encounter windows. We loved the playheads so much that we made those encounter windows, is what we call them. We made that a pillar of the game. We wanted to have as many of those as we could. We thought they were cool. We thought they sold the game. We thought they gave the game a picker kind of vibe.

**The eleventh pillar** was we wanted to put in this wide variety of weapons and armor and actions the player could take with them as we could. This led to the twelfth one which was we also wanted very detailed character creation rules. We wanted the player to be able to make, if they could think of it, they could kind of make a character like that. And this is back when we're doing GURPS, which meant we were using, I think we had over a hundred, I want to say we had over 200 of the skills, but I don't remember, but it was a lot. And because of that, that's why we made pre-made characters, because this pillar said the detailed character creation rules but also pre-made characters. We knew that casual players or people playing the game for the first time are not going to be able to absorb all this or know what was important, so he said, "Have some pre-made characters."

**The thirteenth pillar** was interesting. Now keep in mind, we were still making GURPS. It was, "We're going to make this game for the public, but we want people who play GURPS to be happy." So in other words, we wanted to be faithful to GURPS, but we wanted people who didn't know GURPS to still think it's a fun game. And that informed a lot of our decisions when we were making choices about what to do about GURPS skills.

And then finally, it just said his fourteenth pillar was, "The team is very motivated." This was something we recognized, and we kept as a pillar because we thought it was important. It wasn't until years later that I realized, "Wow, I've never since then put that as a pillar." I've taken it for granted. Doesn't the team want to make this game they're on? If not, why didn't they be put on another team and make that game? And like I said, once when I tried to switch projects with another programmer and the executive producer said no, I'm like, "Why do you want people making games they don't want to make?" But Chris Taylor put that in there as a pillar that the team is motivated, not they should be, not they're going to be, that they were. He said everybody was excited making this game, and he was right.

Okay, that was a very long-winded Vision doc slash pillars for Fallout. Now let me tell you what Arcanum's were. Arcanum's was only a couple pages. There were five of them. The first one was Tech that matters, and the example we gave was we used dynamic colored lighting. This is something we're excited about, that we had dynamic shadows in our Arcanum demo. It was really cool. Daytime, our sunrise was tinted more bluish than sunset, which was more reddish. The lighting affected skill use, as I explained in another video. So we were saying right there in the proposal that when we put tech in for things, we were using technology so that we could have a more realistic, complex character, system mechanics.

Going into that, we actually named character creation as one of our pillars. We wanted a rich, class-free character creation system, more even more so in Fallout. We were like, "If you could think about it, we wanted to be able to make it within the context of Arcanum's world." So you couldn't make like Superman or Spider-Man, but you want to be an old crone witch? Boom. You want to be an old west gunslinger? Boom. You could make a character that was very much like that.

The third pillar supported that. It was a complex, stat-driven game system. Yes, we actually emphasized in the pillars for Arcanum how complex it was. We thought this was a selling point. Now, I know a lot of you out there going, "I know, that's why I liked it." I know. Bear in mind, it's one of the reasons Arcanum didn't sell well. Yes, it was buggy. Yes, it had, there were some other issues. Yes, it got overshadowed by a lot of other games coming out. Yes, it was isometric in the time everyone was going 3D. But one of the things that affected the sales, trust me, or go back and look at reviews, and also I got sales data from Sierra, was the fact it was very complicated. Basically, all the casual RPGs bounced right off of Arcanum. That stuck with me for a long time. You can not believe me, but you really can't deny it unless you have some sales numbers and some demographics figures that I didn't get.

The fourth pillar of Arcanum was a huge single-player quest line, actually quest lines. We wanted a ton of quests. We wanted the main quest to be really long. In fact, relative to Fallout, Fallout had three main story quests: get the

 water chip, destroy the mutant army and the vats, and destroy the master. We had 27 main story points along the Arcanum main story quest line. That's not even counting all the different ways you could do them with all the different characters you build and the tons of side quests we had. Side quests everywhere. We had side quests for every master training of every skill. We were insane back then.

And then finally, on top of all of that, we added the multiplayer pillar. Now yes, that was requested by Sierra, but because they requested it, and we committed to it, we made it a pillar. We wanted you to be able to play this game with your friends. We wanted you to be able to make modules so that's the reason we threw in the tools was effectively to support this pillar. We wanted you to be able to make modules of settings and stories you could play with your friends.

Now, how close we achieved all of these on Arcanum, I don't know. That's you, I'll leave that as an exercise for the reader.

Finally, let me tell you what The Outer Worlds pillars were, and we only had three. Well, we really had a fourth one, but we were, there were three main ones and then the fourth one that we just said was a given. So the four pillars, or the three pillars plus one, were the first one is simple but deep. We basically wanted to make the game as simple as possible, the game systems, the stories, the way companions worked, requests worked. And I know this has come up because people think we oversimplified, but after Arcanum and in many games after that, I was always worried that I seemed to be pushing away the casual RPG player, and I said, "There's got to be a way to make something simple but not simplistic." So the idea was we would make simple systems that gained depth and complexity if you chose to explore them. And I've explained this before, like our melee skill was very easy. You pick up a weapon, your melee skill determines if you hit people that are within range. Actually, no, it automatically hit people within range. The melee skill determined how much damage you did. It was the ranged skill to determine if you hit. So that's simple. Pick up this item, if it looks like you're hitting somebody, you're hitting them. How much damage you're doing is proportional to your skill and the weapon you're using. That's it. Now, if people wanted to learn more, they could start digging into melee, and then they put points in the melee, and then it would specialize into melee, and then they'd have unlocks, and then they could do things like a really cool like power attack, stuff you that were maneuvers that you could choose to do with melee. You could ignore all that if you wanted, but it was there for the non-casual player to start exploring. And then your perks that go with it, and you know, here are things that are, this particular weapon, maybe I'm gonna specialize in science melee weapons. There's one up my science skill and my melee skill, and I'm gonna buy some perks that are good for that.

The second pillar was dark but humorous. This was basically Leonard and I saying, "We've always done this in our games. He's dark, I'm funny. Together, we're dark but humorous." We saw it as part of our special sauce. We decided to codify that into a pillar, the same way that Chris Taylor said the team is motivated was a pillar of Fallout. I wanted to codify that into our game, that we could point to it, remind everybody who read these, there's only four of them to read, that was something we're trying to do. Our setting may be a struggling, nearly pre-apocalyptic colony world, which is just years away from sliding into barbarism, but you wouldn't know it from playing the game. At first, it seems silly. Well, I shouldn't say silly, Leonard doesn't like silly. It was darkly humorous. And what I liked was the most humorous, and even the silly parts of the game were actually the darkest parts of the game. Or they contrasted to, you know, like you've always heard, "You can't have darkness without light," and vice versa. That's what I like about humor and dark storylines.

Our third pillar was interesting because it was the one that got used the most by me when people suggested new features or new content. It was fun trumps realism but be consistent. Basically, I told people, "We're making a game. We're not making a simulation." So, we're always gonna err on the side of fun over the side of realism. And that came up over and over and over. People wanted things that were more, I guess now they call them sims, and I was like, "No, but that's realistic." "Yes, but it's not fun." You know, I like that the player can jump really high. I like that the fact that, you know, these phobias are something that you gain on a, you know, a flip a switch is flipped and bam, now you've got a phobia. I think it's funny. The only thing was, we added that "be consistent" because we want, once you established a limit, you had to be consistent with that. So once you said, you know, "Falls past this distance are fatal," I didn't want somebody to put in a really short, small pit and then put a something at the bottom saying, "Well, now you're dead." You know, if people look and go, "Yeah, I've fallen that much before. I can fall that much now," and then they jump off and it just said, "Nope, you died." I didn't want that. So, for all of our roles, we said, "They can be funny and unrealistic, but once it establishes, you know, what's what, how things work, you have to stay with that."

And then the fourth one, which we threw in is just a given because there's no way we weren't going to do this, was The Outer Worlds is a classic Obsidian game. And everything that meant, it meant strong world setting, good narrative, tons of player customization, a variety of companions, player choices that have meaningful consequences, multiple endings. These are things that happen in, you know, all of the classic Obsidian role-playing games. We were going to support it in ours. We originally only had three pillars, but people were like, "Well, shouldn't we be doing these other things?" And I'm like, "Well, those are given." So, I decided I'd throw them all in as one pillar called classic Obsidian role-playing game. And because of that, that was the four. They were, you know, they were very simple to tell people, simple but deep, dark but humorous, fun trumps realism but be consistent, and a classic Obsidian game. Very easy to understand, very easy to explain to people, and then when they ask questions, you could dive into setting and storyline and all those things.

So, every time I talk about design pillars in my talks, I'm talking about something like what I just told you. What started with Fallout, tightened up in

 Arcanum, and then really we honed for The Outer Worlds. That's what I'm talking about when I say you should have design pillars.
Title: 
Designing Mechanics First

Youtube Link:
https://youtu.be/lCZwL5GJvww?si=vJJ2HY7ZWL7T9tZP

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim. Today I want to talk about the idea of designing mechanics first for your game before doing anything else. This is actually in response to a question from This Is Fine, who asks:

"You've mentioned time and again that it goes setting, then story, and finally system mechanics. But what about the approach that some directors use, like Miyazaki, to design mechanics, movement, levels, etc., first and then develop a fitting story based on one, the lore established in the background, and two, the things that organically emerge while developing the game itself?"

First off, let me say this: obviously, this works for them. They've made great games, so that's great. I'll also say there isn't one magic bullet to making a great game, and anybody who tries to tell you there is is probably trying to sell you something. What I'm telling you here is what I did and discovered worked for me, and therefore is what I recommend. I don't want to make up a theory about the best way to make a game and recommend it if I've never done it myself. So, I have always done it in that order: setting, story, system mechanics, and it's always worked, and I've explained why it works. So, I'm going to kind of walk through here why I do it that way and what I think of doing it the other way.

So, in my experience, I have ideas for tons of mechanics. I've got books all over the place, got one right on my desk here, where I think of something. I think of setting ideas, I think of story ideas, I think of mechanics ideas. I don't have any shortage of those. So, it's never the case of "Well, I'll work on one and then see what it makes me think of." So, because I'm working from that direction, I have a lot of mechanics that would not work well together; they're literally antithetical. Everything from "Well, if you use this mechanic, you're going to have to do save games a certain way," or "If you use this mechanic, it will limit what kind of player characters can be made." So, the mechanics not only don't, some mechanics don't work well with each other, they don't work well with other things.

And I should point out that even ones that do work well together, mechanics I come up with that do work well together, they may set such a limiting constraint on the resulting settings or stories that they would work on, that it's really going to limit what we can do in those areas. And remember, there are a lot of people, non-system mechanic designers, artists, who want to contribute to what the setting and story are going to be. But if you go the other direction and you start with mechanics, you're like, "Well, that's a great story idea, but these mechanics don't fit it," or "Oh, I love that setting, but it really doesn't make sense with this mechanic." So, that's why I don't like to do that because the people who aren't involved in the mechanics will be constrained by it and will ultimately feel like somewhat of a straight jacket when you're trying to "Hey, let's come up with a good story." I like instead thinking of, "Wow, I have this idea for a setting," and somebody goes, "Oh, I love that. Do you know want to be a good story to tell in that?" "Great, you know what we can do to support that story? I can have this mechanic and this mechanic in the game that shores up that story."

Now, when you go in the direction I go, which is setting, story, system mechanics, this has a lot of things that just flows from that. First of all, like I said, artists and story designers can have a say in things about the setting in the story without a limitation because you're not talking about system mechanics yet. So, if say, one of your artists said, "I really want to do a really cool art deco look for the setting," well, if everybody likes that and they think, "Oh yeah, and they have some really cool concept art like, look what I drew. They would look like this." "Hm, what kind of story would be told in a setting like that?" And what I love about that is it's very hard to go the other direction. In *Fallout*, when Leonard had the idea of making it be what the '50s felt the future was, we were still trying to support all of the GURPS generic skills and attributes and advantages. So, it wasn't that part of the mechanics weren't in any way going to be a constraint, but I can tell you when we replaced GURPS, a lot of thought went into those mechanics based on what our setting already was. We suddenly were like, "It's important to have radiation mechanics. It's important to have poison mechanics. It's important to have skills and perks that are going to support certain things we know the player will want to do because we've got enough of the game written already that we know they try to do them." So, that was important.

A second reason going setting, story, mechanics, I think works well, is this lets you decide what mechanics to use from the enormous space of possibility of mechanics. Now, I know people go, "Well, the reverse is true. Once you put some pins in mechanics, it kind of defines what kind of setting and story you can tell." And I'm like, "That's true, but I just said how much it constrains all the non-system mechanics people, which there are way more people on your team who aren't thinking about system mechanics than ones that are." And because, like I said, there are so many system mechanics out there, I've rarely felt like someone has said, "Hey, let's tell this story in this setting," and I'm like, "I have no idea for a system mechanic for that." No, it's still the problem that I'm usually, I have dozens of ideas. I wonder which ones we should use. So, I've never felt too constrained mechanically by the setting and story, but the reverse happens a lot.

The other thing I will say is because you're doing the mechanics after picking setting and story, and I've talked about how mechanics can conflict with each other or conflict with those, you end up picking ones to support the setting and the story, to reinforce things about them. That automatically makes your mechanics feel more coherent, like they belong in the game. Maybe you've played a game, and it's got a mechanic, and you're like, "Why is this here? Why am I being forced to do this or play this way?" It seems antithetical to what the game is telling me you should play like, especially if you've played a fantasy game where people seem surprised that you spoke with the dead or raised the dead or healed someone who was blind. It's like, "Um, would you please look around? We're in a fantasy world. Why are you surprised about this mechanic?" And it was because either the mechanic was put in without any idea of how it would change the story or the setting, or the mechanic came first, and then the setting was made, either independently of it or without too much feeling like they need

 to be too constrained. I like because the people who make mechanics tend to be a little more left-brained, I like that once the setting and story have pins put in them, you pick mechanics that support them. Those mechanics automatically feel more coherent and that they go together.

And then the final reason I want to talk about this, which may be more directly tied to my experience as opposed to the game directors that the question asker asked, is I find that more often than not, when publishers first approach you, they ask first about the setting more than anything else. And often, they will approach you, sometimes wanting work in a particular setting. I've been approached, I mean, at Troika, the first thing they asked is, "Well, what kind of game is it?" And we said, "It's a fantasy game that's undergoing an industrial revolution." They didn't know or care, "Oh, by the way, the skills have an orthogonal training system attached to them, so they increase in ranks and training." No one ever asked me that. Similarly, when we were approached for the next two Troika games, they came with a setting already. They're like, "Will you do D&D? Will you do World of Darkness?" And it's like, "Hm, then for story, that was the second thing that Atari asked, like, 'What module would you pick?'" And the discussion of mechanics came later, when I was like, "Hey, I may not be able to do Bard or Paladin." And obviously, I did, but that came later.

And even if you're making an original IP, they may later bring up mechanics in a discussion, but I find that most publishers, the closest they come to asking you a question about the mechanics is when they ask you, "Well, are you doing anything original? Is there any hook? Is there anything that this game does that other games don't do?" And frequently, that's a mechanics question, but that's the closest I've ever gotten to a publisher asking for or demanding a mechanic, outside of, "Hey, can we put some microtransactions in this?" or "Can you put a tutorial level in?" And to me, that's more, that's kind of outside the scope of system mechanics. It's something they're thinking of at the meta level.

So, I hope this answered your question, This Is Fine, about why I go setting, story, system mechanics. Other directors may go the opposite direction, and it worked great for them. This is all I know, this is what I think works, and this is why I think it works. So, I hope that answered your question.
Title:
Developing Pillars Of Eternity.md
Youtube Link:

https://youtu.be/su5wE2C5UWM?si=_t8GYrZXviphyuqz

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim. Today I want to talk about developing Pillars of Eternity. This has been a very well requested video, but what I put off on doing because, like South Park, I was not involved in Pillars in any lead role, and my notes on it are brief. I don't have a lot of deep notes on Pillars. Luckily, you know, this wasn't that long ago so I can remember a lot of stuff, but it's not like Fallout or any of the Troika games, or especially Wob Star Carbide where I have extensive notes on the development. But I think I can answer a lot of questions and tell you some fun stories about it. So let's go.

I was on South Park since October of 2011 when I joined with Obsidian. Kickstarter, before the Kickstarter for Pillars the next year in September of 2012, I was asked to be involved. Josh and Fergus came to talk to me. We talked about some designs I could do, did some videos before the Kickstarter even went live because there are stretch goals and I and updates that have to be done. The Kickstarter, though, turned out to be huge. If you remember, we asked for a million, and we made that on day one. And since the Kickstarter ran for a month, by the end of the month, we had 4 million, I think a little more than 4 million. There was a lot.

I got involved in design stuff. I also, because the monetary value kept going up, we realized we needed desperately needed more stretch goals, and that's how the recipes came into being. I forget, I think it was Josh who came and asked me about him. I think my response was, "Wow, I haven't put recipes in games since Temple in 2003," and he thought he was saying no, I wouldn't do it, and I'm like, "No, what I mean is I have a ton of recipes," and I ended up writing those just I just collected them from my recipe collection. Josh was the one who rewrote them into lore of the game.

But what was interesting about Kickstarter is that meant since it was crowdsourced, all the features were defined before we were funded. There wasn't a lot of wiggle room for things you do with a publisher like, you know, we're these things are going to be determined, these things are TBD, we didn't have that luxury. Also, the money comes from Kickstarter, and it's fixed. There's no going back to the well. If you, we had four million dollars to spend and not a dime more, which meant things had to be very carefully monitored and tracked.

I remember watching the countdown with a lot of other people Obsidian on the final day. There's a video floating around you can watch us sitting around one of our lounges watching the Kickstarter and big screen TV. That was really cool.

Designs and while I was still working on South Park doing programming, as soon as Kickstarter was done, I started in on the designs, and the designs got done in a first pass in for the Kickstarter because we had to describe them, but I actually had to like know to the grindstone write all these things down. Just to be clear, I did the I did two other classes, the Monk and the Cipher. I did the crafting system and the stronghold.

Now all these designs went through Josh, and there were modifications made, and I'll talk about that and I'll leave in, um, talk about a couple ideas I had that didn't make it in. So the Cipher class was very much inspired by the Esper class that I helped make for WildStar that shipped. So you can go take a look if you want to. Actually, Wild Turkey played anymore, but you can look it up. The Esper and the Cipher share a lot of similarities.

The Monk was an interesting one because I wanted to do a class that was powered by the damage they took. So the more damage they took, um, the more abilities they could use. The wound system encapsulates that really well because, first of all, explains why monks don't wear armor. They want to be hit. They want to take that damage. It converts into a wound, so even if they get healed, they still have that wound that they can spend. I really like that. It I like when system mechanics explain why a class is the way it is.

Um, so I also did the crafting system. The crafting system was pretty straightforward. There were different stations you went to for the different items you would craft. You collect the ingredients, craft it, pretty straightforward. The stronghold was originally far less abstract than what shipped. The stronghold was originally designed with all these extra things you could build onto it that gave you passive or active bonuses. Your companions that were assigned a stronghold would literally go off on quests, and I think you ran them, you ran them through quests through procedurally generated Dungeons, and that's important because I'll talk about procedurally generated again soon. You can see I've been talking about procedure. I've been thinking procedurally generated content for decades.

So you'd run your companions through these procedurally generated dungeons to complete stronghold quests, and all this went back into the stronghold system that made your stronghold bigger and better. There was no time to do this. Like I said, our money was fixed. Once you did a Kickstarter, that was how much money you had, so Josh made a lot of those systems a lot more abstract.

There was a related system that I was hoping we could do called The Adventures Guild. The Adventures Guild was the design of something that was going to be in one of the towns that you could go to to get companions, but they just didn't have a bunch of companions sitting around for you to take. The way it worked was you built, you made your own companion with your character creation, made a companion, and then you'd run that companion through a variety of procedurally generated dungeons. I like this because it not only that the player experiment with different class and race combinations, but it also let them make a companion that was specifically something they wanted to pair with their main player character. Of course, we didn't have time to do particularly generated Dungeons, and it all got swept aside and didn't get done, which I understand. What I loved, though, was someone called my idea it's like build a bear but with bloodshed. I love that description.

The other, uh, ideas I had, I thought the Watcher, the idea of the player being a watcher, needed more systemic support. So I wanted it. I wanted special abilities for The Watcher, and I also wanted system mechanics that we shipped with to go through a watcher flavored, um, design. I'll give you an example. The Watcher was supposed to constantly be seeing and talking to Spirits. So rather than just have the fine trap skill where you click on it and it highlights traps that are around you, I wanted instead it the a spirit would show up and walk down the hallway and set off a ghost version of the Trap. So the spirit would be done in a ghost pixel Shader, and the trap would execute as it goes pixel Shader, and then they both Fade Out. Now you know there's a trap in the hallway, and you did it by having a spirit show you. You did it through the your Watcher ability

. Similarly, with finding a secret door, rather than just have it highlight the Secret Door, you actually see a ghost walk over, pull the book, pull the lever, whatever activated, and the ghost Secret Door would open. The ghost would walk through the ghost secret door and shut. Boom, there your Watcher abilities just let you find a secret door.

Again, we didn't have time to do this, so that got cut. I understand it. I kind of miss it. I love when system mechanics, again I've said this, when system mechanics support a an ability. And just so you know, I had a rule with Josh. Josh was the lead designer. I was doing side design. I had a role that I'd only bring up a design idea once, and then I wouldn't bring it up again. I only broke that rule once on the entire development of Pillars, and that was for that watching system. I brought it up again. I said, "Hey, I really think we should do this. It's so cool, and it will just remind the player, to reiterate and underscore, you're a watcher. Even your most basic things that you've seen in every other RPG is a watcher flavored ability in this one." But we just didn't have time to do it.

Coding. When the Kickstarter made it, I was immediately made moved from South Park over to Pillars of Eternity to begin coding. However, and that was in September of 2012. South Park wasn't done, and it wasn't going to be done for another year and a half. A few months later, in mid-2013, I was moved from Pillars back to South Park because South Park really needed a lot of bug fixing, needed a lot of optimization. I worked on that for about eight, nine months. In March of 2014, I finally went back to Pillars, and so I was on that for the final year. I coded combat and basically everything you could think of that was associated with combat, the class ability spells, any items, creature attacks, creature abilities, all of these internally were called spells, and I just made a spell system. A spell was anything that had an effect on the world, whether it was damage, whether it applied a status effect, whether it changed the state of the world. It was all done through a spell because there was a spell system that managed beginning the spell, maintaining it, and then turning it off and cleaning up all of its effects in the world. That's why status effects also went through the spouse system because status effects are things that get applied to a creature, including the player, and make alterations to them, and then eventually come off and have to be undone. So all that went through a giant switch statement of status effects and spells. I'd heard at one point that Baldur's Gate had a huge, huge switch statement devoted to their spouse. So did Pillars of Eternity. That thing was enormous. I wanted to break it up, but it didn't make it any clearer to break it up into multiple switch statements and different functions because there was no good breakdown of of spells and status effects. It was just here's a list of status effects we support, execute them. I also did crafting, so I did a limited amount of UI. We had a UI programmer who did more UI work than I did, and I like the crafting system was primarily UI, so he took care of that after the design was done.

And then right at the end of Pillars, there was a big crunch, um, to get it out. It went out in March of 2015, got great reviews, great reviews, and I immediately switched over to Tyranny. So there wasn't even a lot of breathing space. It was interesting because I moved on to Pillars from South Park immediately and then moved back and then moved back again and then as the moment Pillars went out, boom, I was on Tyranny. So that entire period of time from 2011 to 2016, when Tyranny shipped, was just a blur of coding and some design. But I hope this gives you an idea of Pillars of Eternity development from my point of view and what it was like to be primarily a programmer doing a little bit of design on the side.

Developing South Park The Stick Of Truth.md

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim. Today I want to talk about South Park: the Stick of Truth. Also, lavalier mic so hopefully this sounds better. I haven't talked much about South Park or pillars of Eternity or tyranny because I wasn't involved in any of those projects in a lead role, so my viewpoint is mainly as a programmer. I did some design, but mostly I was a programmer, so take these stories as from someone with that somewhat limited viewpoint. When I talk about a lot of my other games, I was a lead or even the Project Lead, so I had access to a lot of information of stuff that was going on, not true in South Park. In fact, I came onto that project late in October of 2011. The game was supposed to have shipped in six months, and I was only coming on as a temporary employee. I was planning to move to Seattle when I was done. For various reasons, that never happened, and South Park itself wouldn't ship for almost three years later, it shipped in end of first quarter I think 2014, so two and a half years later.

I was replacing a programmer who's moving on to another project they had called stormlands, which ended up getting canceled. But I'll explain some things that happened along the timeline of South Park, so I started in October of 2011. I was going to be a programmer. The game itself, South Park, used code from Obsidian's in-house engine, Onyx, that they used in Dungeon Siege 3. This explained why many of the C plus methods began with Ds underscore. So, I was quickly trying to come up to speed with that engine, which was in C plus, and South Park was going to be my first console game. I'd never made a console game before this, so I was kind of excited just for that reason. Turns out the Xbox pretty easy to code for if you know the PC, especially DirectX calls. PlayStation 3, not so much easy to code for. It had its own special cell architecture, it had multiple processors. My biggest issue with the PS3 was if you put a breakpoint on your code, it didn't always stop where you put the breakpoint because multiple processors will be running, you'd see them go stop, stop, stop, stop, and maybe they stopped at the line you wanted, maybe they stopped one line under one line later because the your the way your breakpoint was there was already an instruction that was given out to a CPU before it realized oh I've got to stop here. So, it meant debugging was a little interesting. I learned how to do it, wasn't a huge fan. In fact, whenever a bug came in from QA, I checked, and if it wasn't PS3 only, I always debugged it on the PC or the Xbox. Sometimes one came in and said this is only happening on the PS3, and I'd be like okay, let's let's crank up that debugger and figure it out.

I was a huge South Park fan, huge. I remember watching their Christmas special back during a Thursday night thing, which was one of those weekly things we did at Interplay. I remember when that special came out, we thought it was a one-off, it was Jesus fighting Santa Claus, George Clooney was involved, I think he was the voice of the dog. It was funny, we thought it was a one-off, next thing we knew, they had a show. So, it was really fun to be working on it. You have to remember though, there's a particular kind of humor in South Park, not everybody likes it. I think it's hilarious, I love how they make fun of everybody, no one escapes being ridiculed on that show, same thing with Simpsons. I like that style of humor, they you know they have a gay character, Big Gay Al, I think he's funny, yeah he's a stereotype, he's hilarious. So, I believe a few people had issues and either they didn't work on the project or some of them just worked on the project but didn't do the more disturbing work. You have to remember, there were some things, and I'll talk about something I had to do, but there were some things where you had to especially as an artist, frame by frame, like draw people's private parts and their underwear and just gross things happening, you know, someone had to animate Mr. Hanky, the piece of poop. I mean, you just, it's not like it happens like that, so this is the person who spent every day staring into their monitor, you know, making a model or animating it or putting a skeleton in and doing the animations and setting animation frames and all that on a dancing piece of poop, that was the job.

One thing I noticed was Matt and Trey seem to change their minds a lot. Jokes would go in, system mechanics would go in, levels would go in, and then later they they wouldn't like them. They said, well, we initially we liked it, and now we don't think it's funny. Well, that's the problem with video games, is you're gonna play it multiple times. It's not like a show where you do the storyboards, you animate it, it's up in a week, and you're done. This thing takes years to make, and you're gonna be seeing those jokes over and over again, so I think we lost a lot of funny stuff. There were a ton of levels that we did, completely finished, done, coded, art, debugged, optimized. I mean, I remember optimizing a level that got cut. It was sad because some of these were super fun and would have added a lot to the game. They added new factions, new areas of the town. One of the ones I remember the most, there was a cemetery with a bunch of goth kids, and you went in it, and you had a big fight with I remember there, I think there was a werewolf. I know Michael Jackson was involved, it was just, it was such a cool level, and it all got cut. We had a whole thing called Christmas Town, which was North Pole or north of Canada. Canada itself, you know, done in the 8-Bit style, was hilarious. The one I worked on a lot, there was a faction of all girls who loved Paris Hilton, and their gang was called the stupid spoiled, and at one point, their leader, Paris Hilton, comes to school, and you have to fight her, and she's a boss, and she had a special attack called the vag blast. And I mean, I'm not an artist, I didn't animate this thing, but at one point, there was a bug with it, and I remember sitting with the artist, going through it on my computer in debug mode, frame by frame, trying to figure out what happened, and things were spewing across the screen, there was a baby shark, there was a pineapple, and I was just like, hmm, yeah, let's oh, we finally found the bug, you know, it got to be done with that. There was an entire alternative advancement system that was made, that was eventually not approved, but I thought it was great. Jesse Farrell had made it, it was called the ass system, because all of the advancements were called like things like

 smart ass, kick ass, dumbass, I think one was called jackass, just a bunch of funny names like that, and they were all represented like this is the, you know, I think the uh, spellcaster was smart ass, and the fighter was like kick ass, so it made sense, it was fun, it was very South Park, didn't get approved.

Another interesting thing is when I started, there was a producer on it, and I'm not sure what happened, I didn't interact with him much, and then he got replaced, and Chris Parker stepped in. Chris Parker was one of, there were five owners at the time, there only Chris Parker and Chris Avellone seemed actively involved in game development. Fergus could do it, anyway, I told you he did it on Fallout, but running a business is a lot of work. Chris Jones was handling all the tech director stuff, and Darren Monahan was handling I.T and basically operations, so they were busy. Chris Parker was really good because, and I've told many people this, he's the kind of person who can step in, and he will get that game across the finish line. There's a joke in game development that the first 80% of game development takes 80% of the time, and then the last 20% of a game's development takes another eighty percent of your time. That's because it doesn't seem this way, but you always seem to get most of the game done, and that from that's when the unexpected problems happen, that's when it becomes obvious that you misestimated how long things would take, that there are more bugs or optimizations that needs to be done that couldn't be predicted, that lighting isn't working well or lighting caused levels to slow down, and now you need more optimization. There are always things like that. Parker seems really good at organizing this stuff, cutting through a bunch of bureaucratic tape, and just getting stuff done, so that was really cool.

The other thing that happened was, during the development of South Park, Josh Sawyer and Adam Brennecke did the Kickstarter for pillars, and I thought it was cool. I was like, this is really cool. Well, I started getting involved in that, they asked me to do some design stuff, I did some classes, I did the stronghold, these all these eventually got modified by Josh, but it was fun to be involved. I also, at some point, we were, I did some videos for it, we were doing stretch goals. Josh wanted me to do my recipes from a lot of my previous games or just brand new recipes, and that eventually became a stretch goal and something that kind of that you could get. I thought that was pretty cool because it was nice having those recipes printed. What that meant was the Kickstarter started in September of 2012 and ended a month later, and wow, you know, we got a lot of money, and we had to start this thing, so I was still in South Park, so I tried to finish up my stuff there, and then in 2013, I got moved over to pillars, and I started doing a lot of code for that. The problem was South Park really couldn't stand, I mean, at the end of a game development, artists can tend to move somewhere else, but programmers are needed. There are features that need to be done, optimization, so I got moved back onto South Park. It was funny because I, it was, I'm with pillars, and then when I was on South Park and pillars, and I went back to South Park, finished it, and I think literally the next day, I came in and just instead of spinning up Microsoft Visual Studio to do work on South Park, I spun up Unity to do work on pillars. So, pillars or South Park shipped in March of 2014. I think it did really well, it was a fun game, it was super fun. One I actually designed something for the game that got cut, it was called, it was a different form of turn-based where you, when you after you moved, you didn't go back to your position, so you moved and you stayed wherever you ended your move at, so if you ran up to attack something and hit them, and then you were out of action points, that's where you ended up. Some people, you know, if you could take a step forward, hit them, and then move away a little bit, it was fun because it meant the screen, the combat screen got all jumbled up. We ended up not going with that, but it was super fun to work on it. Like I said, there was so much system, mechanics, and actual content and art that got thrown away, that game just blew my mind. There could probably be an entirely second game shipped with what got thrown away. But it was super fun to work on, I'm glad it did super well, it was my first console game, super happy, wasn't my last, but it was fun to work on consoles, and it was fun to work on South Park, and after carbine, it was fun just to be a programmer again. So anyway, those are most of my stories about Stick of Truth, and I'll try to put together eventually something on pillars and tyranny as well.

Developing Tyranny.md

https://youtu.be/KZTkg50ihsU?si=MKu62X0H5V9av8rr

Hi everyone, it's me Tim. Today I want to talk about the development of Tyranny. Now, like my Pillars of Eternity talk, I was not a lead on this project. This project only lasted about a year and a half, and I don't have a lot of notes, but I will try to tell you the major points. For me, this is all again from my point of view. Here, the actual development of Tyranny, you need someone like Josh Sawyer or Brian Hines, who was the game director, or Chris Avellone, who started as the game director. So I'm just telling you the point of view of someone who did programming.

I started working on Tyranny right after Pillars of Eternity's shift in March of 2015. It was not a sequel, but it did use the engine that Pillars used, so I was already familiar with the code and I was up to speed on Unity. So it just made sense to move me right onto Tyranny, and I started working on it. Now when I started, Chris Avellone was the game director for it, and he had given a very interesting mandate. There were things that didn't exist in the world, and one of them was religion. And I remember talking to him about it because I said, I took a, I don't think it was my religion class, I think it was a philosophy class I took in college, and there was a professor who said, and I don't know if this is true, but there are three things that every human civilization has always created with no exceptions, no matter how remote, no matter whether it's in a cold or temperate or tropical zone, no matter what, humans have always invented religion, dragons, and soup. You can find them in every culture, every civilization all around the world.

So I thought it was interesting that there was no religion. He just, that was something he wanted to explore, and I'm fine with that. There was a lot of things in my games where I would lay down something, we're not, this is something we're not going to have, or this is something we're going to explore, so I got it. What was interesting was one of the programmers, Brian McIntosh, had this fantastic idea for explaining that lack of religion and also why edicts existed. He told me, and I thought it was great, it didn't go anywhere. I don't know if it got shot down or he didn't promote it, but his idea was that at some point while playing Tyranny, you can come across a cave that's really hard to get to and really hard to get into, maybe you have to knock down a wall or something, and you find an older man sitting there, and you tell them, "Hey, the way he's free," and he goes, "I cannot leave this cave."

And you can eventually get him to explain that he is a God, maybe the god, and he saw when people started worshiping him and asking him for miracles, he saw how bad that was for them. So he issued an edict that there could be no religion. The side effect of this edict unwittingly trapped him in the cave because nobody's, nobody can see a god because that would cause a religion, and it also meant that his ability to do edicts was stripped from him and distributed into the world, possibly in the towers, possibly where Kyros got it, possibly where you got it. By the way, there's spoilers for Tyranny in this. Anyway, I thought that was a great idea, and I really told him that I loved it. Nothing happened to it, don't know why, but anyway, so there's a little story about The Tyranny that could have been.

Anyway, my work on Tyranny was very similar to Pillars. I did the abilities, items, creature attacks, magic spells. Internally, these were all called spells just like Pillars, and I just continued my work on those because I was very familiar with that setup having done most of it for Pillars. I did not do the spell crafting UI in Tyranny, but I did support all the underlying spell components. So I thought that was a really neat system. It was really cool to be able to make a spell and put together exactly what you wanted.

And I was very happy to support the work on that. Doing that was a lot of work. It was done by Bryson Till, I think he was the one in charge of it. So yeah, see, this is what happens when I have notes, I forget people's names, and I forget exactly who did what. So anyway, I started Tyranny in, like I said, March of 2015. In late 2015 or early 2016, Obsidian started having late afternoon meetings on new IP, and one of the owners asked me if I wanted to come, and I said no, I was really pleased. Yeah, I'm just not, I have a lot of ideas, I've got all my idea books, but I'm just, I don't feel like handing one of my IP ideas over to someone else to create, and I don't feel like being a game director. So that was fine, until Anthony Davis, one of the programmers at Obsidian, showed up at my door, and he said, "You really should go to the IP meetings." And I'm like, "Anthony, I don't want to make one." He goes, "How, how would it hurt to just go? You've got permission to go, you can just take an hour off the middle of the day and go sit in the conference room in the corner and listen."

Now, if you know Anthony Davis, he can be very persuasive, but not in a manipulative way, in a very puppy dog kind of way. He's like, "Just go." So I finally said, "Okay, I will go to the IP meetings." I went to them, there were some really good IP ideas thrown out, several of which I was like, "We should really be following up on these." I threw out one myself, which was my idea, it'll bubble in a nutshell, was, "Let's put together a game that feels like fantasy and then it turns into science fiction." All of these were shot down, every single one, boom, boom, boom. And so I finally stopped going to those meetings, and Anthony came back, and he could go to the meetings, and I'm like, "Nope." And here's why: People gave really good ideas, they were shot down for no good reason. There was no objective critique. You have a whole video on how to give good critique. No good critique was given. Basically, the person gave a good idea and they were told, "Yeah, no." And I was like, "I've had enough with this."

Finally, one of the owners came to me and said, "Well, they kind of had an idea for a game, and they were hoping that someone would come up with a setting or IP idea that their idea would fit within, but that hadn't happened." And I'm like, "Well then you should have been honest with people and said what you were looking for." That was when they said, "Well, what if we told you the idea and you could be the game director

 on it?" And I said, "No." I mean, this was four years after Carbine, and I was, I was done. I was absolutely done with being a game director. Watch that video, I'm not repeating it here, but I was done. Let's just say that not only did one or two of the owners talk to me and Anthony, but when they asked me like why I didn't want to do it, one of the things I said was that what I really liked making IPs, that was when I did it with Leonard and Jason, and I really liked that back and forth of being able to work with someone. They agreed, and we contacted them. Leonard was interested, even though he was at Blizzard. They literally hired him in April of 2016. So I was still doing some code on Tyranny, but I was now doing design work with Leonard on the game that would become The Outer Worlds. I would say in April, May, June, I was a lot more Outer Worlds than Tyranny, but Tyranny was supposed to ship that fall, and so by mid-summer at the latest, I swung back onto Tyranny. Tyranny, in fact, had a bit of a crunch at the end, and I participated in that. That was just, it was not reasonable to expect someone to pick up all my code and debug it and optimize it, so I went back onto Tyranny. And if that sounds familiar, this is exactly what happened with Pillars and South Park. I went from South Park to Pillars and back to South Park and then back to Pillars. Here, I went from Tyranny to Outer Worlds and then back to Tyranny. Finished it, that came out in 2016. And then interestingly, I did go back to Outer Worlds, but I also started on Deadfire. There were some ideas they had for the sequel to Pillars that they wanted to get a few spells done, and I worked on that. I worked on the Deadfire spell system. Then that transferred to actually the programmer I mentioned, Brian McIntosh, and I worked with him a little bit on like handshaking, getting my code handed off to him. I also told him, I gave him a list of things, like this is the immediate thing I would have done given some downtime. Here's how I would have refactored my code because when code gets shipped and you're so desperate at the end and you're putting a lot of things in and you're fixing stuff, it becomes a little messy, and I wanted to refactor it to be cleaner. Told him what I was going to do with that. I also remember telling him, you know, I would have loved to make turn-based Pillars, turn-based, and we talked about how to do that, and Brian is the one who eventually made the turn-based mode for Pillars 2. So thank him.

So but after starting that Deadfire spell in late fall 2016, I went right back, and so Tyranny's out, Tyranny came out in November, I went right back onto Outer Worlds. So I think even by the time Outer Worlds or by the time Tyranny hit the shelf, I had finished the crunch on Tyranny, done some work on Deadfire spells, and then was back on Outer Worlds. So I just realized a lot of me talking here wasn't even about Tyranny, but that's what you have to understand. I worked on Tyranny as a senior programmer primarily doing the spouse support. I'd occasionally have design chats with originally Chris Avellone and then Brian Hines, and that was about it, and I even kind of slipped away before it even shipped to start the Outer World, but then I came back to help fix it and get it shipped. So that was pretty much my entire involvement in Tyranny. So that's why I can't even answer a lot of Tyranny questions. My answer would be, I don't know, somebody else did that, and my notes don't have exactly who. So I haven't been avoiding talking about South Park and Pillars and Tyranny, it's just my involvement in them was less than a lot of my other games, and I don't have notes on it, and that's, that's this is the best I can do. So that's most of what I remember about working on Tyranny. I hope that puts it into perspective. Anyway, for all people asked for a Tyranny of Rio, I hope this is what you wanted.

Durability Mechanics.md
Youtube Link:
https://youtu.be/BPzMDnev_hE?si=XQkxuZVtw3HS2ZIw

**Hey everyone, it's me, Tim. Today, I want to answer another question about weapon durability.**

Ice Dog 111 asks, "I was wondering if you could do a video about weapon durability or equipment durability as a game mechanic. Is it an outdated mechanic, or is it still valid? P.S. Who came up with the weapon-destroying golems in Arcanum, the Black Mountain Clan mines? Golem Gauntlet still gives me nightmares."

Okay, I'm going to answer that last question first, but I'm gonna put a big caveat on it. I don't have any note that specifically says who did it, but my brain hole tells me with 90% certainty it was Chad Moore. I believe he did most of the Black Mountain plan Minds, so I think he put that in there. It's not a system mechanic in the game; the breakage was put as a script on the golems. And our source control we used, the version that I have that I preserved in my archive, doesn't say who did it. It doesn't have the first person to check it in or the last person to check it in. All I have is my name because I ended up making a copy of the latest version of that archive, the shipped version. So, I don't know for sure, but I think it was Chad Moore.

Anyway, let's talk about weapon or equipment durability in general. I don't think it's outdated. In fact, I had it in The Outer Worlds. Um, it was interesting though. I understand the controversy. There were people on our design team who wanted it removed. They begged me to remove it. They hated it. They said it was frustrating and terrible and... but the other thing is, many of those same people wanted me to get rid of ammo too. They didn't want ammo in the game. They wanted, once you pick up a weapon, any kind of weapon, ranged, melee, anything, it just worked forever. So there was no such thing as anything needing a power cell to run or anything needing ammo or bullets, which I did not agree with, and I'll talk about that.

But I also think that, in many ways, the durability in The Outer Worlds was way too easy. I've heard people say that they didn't like it or when they started the game like, "Oh, it's got durability," and I've seen people post, "Oh, I don't want to play this game because it has durability." But I've seen so many people go, "Once you get started, it's not something big to worry about." I think the reason I think we made it too easy is any weapon could be scrapped into weapon parts then you could use to repair any other weapon. In hindsight, I really like the Fallout method where a one weapon repairs a like weapon, so you are encouraged, you're actually happy when you find duplicate drops because you're like, "Oh good, it's a .45 pistol. I can use that to repair the .45 pistol I'm using that I really like," especially if you have a modded one. You can just use unmodded ones to keep it repaired. I like that. It also has the really cool thing if you find a really rare weapon, either you can't find a similar weapon to repair it with, or they themselves are rare, and then you're forced to pay to have it repaired. And I like that, and I'll talk about why I like that.

So, I get that it's controversial, and it frustrates some players, but let's talk about durability in general and the pros and cons of using it. So, I'll go over the pros first. First off, weapon durability encourages a very thoughtful use of weapons. There's a lot of people who just pick up a weapon in the game, and it does seem to do a lot of damage, and then they use it for everything for the rest of the game, even though that weapon may not be good against certain armor types or certain creature types. They never bothered to learn it. They're just like, "I have this machine gun. Everything gets shot with my machine gun." If weapon durability introduces that you will wear down a weapon, people are kind of forced to go, "Okay, when should I use this weapon? This weapon is good against lightly armored people or creatures that don't have thick armor."

That leads to the second pro, which is it encourages players to use a variety of weapons in a game. Once you learn that weapons wear out, even if you don't go into that thoughtful mode of, "I'm going to look at exactly what weapons do and try to choose the best weapon for a particular combat," you will still be forced to use a variety when your favorite weapon breaks, and then you have to go to the next weapon you have in your inventory. Ammo, this is also why I like ammo because sometimes you can put a really cool weapon in the game. You can introduce it, but ammo is scarce at that point, so people will use it, but they can't use it for everything. And then later in the game, when it's on par with the creatures you encounter, the ammo can become more common. And that's also a great way to support different character types. If you have a character who has specialized in crafting, maybe he can make the rare ammo for it, so he hasn't spent his points in combat, but he has spent points in crafting. And now he can make that rare ammo. So it's that kind of balance. Why you have so many levers like this, you can pull. In fact, let me go into that. And I, by the way, I could do a whole topic on what I'm about to talk about, which is money sinks versus money sources.

I could do a whole video on that. There's a whole section of system design which is game economics, where big enough games usually hire a game designer who does nothing but that game's economics. This is especially true in MMOs because when you have a large MMO with both a large player base and its long-term running, it's a game of service, so you'll be playing it for years. Economy is super important. It's one thing to end up playing a single-player game with a million coins. It's very different to end up with a million coins in an MMO like WoW because they have player economies. Players trade things. Players go to the auction house. Once money becomes devalued, it just turns back into a barter system.

So, the reason I like weapon and just general equipment durability is it is a great money sink. It is a thing that the player has to think of all the time because every player, even the non-combat ones, will eventually have to use a weapon. You know, you can't persuade a rad scorpion or an auto mechanical not to attack you. Money Sink. And it's also a money sink in a way that you're that isn't as obvious in the sense of if you have to pay to get an item repaired or to buy parts to repair an item, it's an obvious money sink, but it's also a passive money sink in the sense of when you find an item, and this is true for Fallout or Outer Worlds, that you would normally have sold to make money, but you either keep it in Fallout because you're going to use it

 to repair another weapon or you break it down in The Outer Worlds into weapon parts that you can then use to repair their weapons. That is something that you didn't sell. So, it makes the item drops add less money into the economy. So, in effect, they act like a money sink because you're not, they're not generating money. They're not a money source anymore.

Now, you know, I think that we could have made, like I said, the Outer World one, I would have preferred to maybe do the Fallout one in hindsight, but even if I hadn't done that, I think weapon parts either should have not dropped as their own item and only be something that you get when you tear apart a weapon, and maybe not all the time, and they're expensive in a store. And that way, they're more valuable. I know a lot of people say, "Day in the game with enough weapon parts to repair all their weapons 10 times over." And I, yes, that happened in QA. It was one of the things that happened in game development where you're getting near the end of the game, and you have to prioritize bugs. Money sinks and sources are not the same as crashes and combat imbalances, and they tend to get prioritized lower. So, that's why you see so many games out there that are very unbalanced economically. It's because it just doesn't matter.

Now, I get the negative weapon and Equipment durability frustrates some players. I get that. The thing is, and this is something I always talk about with new designers, you probably can't name a feature that doesn't frustrate some subgroup of players, which means if your goal is to make a game with no feature that no player dislikes, you will fail. So, your goal is that even if you're frustrating a player, and by the way, one player's frustration is another player's challenge, come up with a way that they can either ameliorate it so it doesn't really affect them. They can make a character that's not affected by this. Perfect example: stealth and talk characters in my games are less affected by weapon durability because they literally don't use them as often. They're not using their weapons. They're not, their armors and getting struck as often doesn't affect them as much. As long as you have those amelioration paths for any frustration, I think it's good.

Let me talk about a game that's not mine, Breath of the Wild, which I played and liked. I have a Switch. Super fun. It has an extreme example of durability in that weapons in that game degrade with no real way to repair. Yes, I get that there are some special ways to repair limited types, like the rock Octoroks can repair rusty weapons, and there's a few others, but when I played the game, I didn't know any of those. The game certainly doesn't tell you about them. So that's a game that the designers expect you to use a weapon until it breaks and then move on. They're forcing you to be thoughtful in how you use your weapon and use a variety, but it's a very extreme example of weapon durability. I don't think that game suffered in any way. It certainly was popular and sold a lot of units. Yes, there are people who complain about it, but find me a game where no one complains about any feature in it. I would like to hear about that game, and I would like to learn from that game's design because I've never found such a game. So, I just wanted to throw that out there as, okay, here's an example of a game I didn't make that I think is great, that has this feature that frustrates people.

So, we have that. The bottom line with weapon durability is it slots into what I mentioned about game economics, and the bottom line that I want to make here is every game needs money sinks and money sources, and they have them. In an effort not to frustrate players, most games, especially single-player games, fall into the too many sources, not enough sinks category, but every game has sinks. Every system mechanic that leads to those things is something that will frustrate some subgroup of players, and you simply have to pick and choose what you want to do in your game. Pick some of those challenges slash frustrations, come up with some ways to ameliorate it, and move on. I think that's the best you can do, and I don't think there's any way to avoid it. And because of that, I don't think equipment durability is an outmoded idea. I think there are other ways to do economic balancing, but it's one tool in the economic tool chest. And that's what I think of that.

Elden Ring and EverQuest.md

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim, and today I want to talk about Elden Ring and EverQuest, and you may be going, what do these games have to do with each other? I will explain.

So, I know I said I was going to review a game, please don't consider this a review of either Elder Ring or EverQuest. I was talking with a friend of mine a few months ago, and I mentioned that Elden Ring was one of my favorite games from last year, from 2022, and he was really surprised because, as he reminded me, I wasn't really into the Dark Souls games. I didn't hate them; they just weren't for me. I found them to be very linear, and I found the combat to be very choreographed. It's the same reason I liked most of WoW but I didn't like WoW's raids because those attacks felt like dance choreography. It was like, attack, attack, stand behind this pillar, wait, wait, step out, attack, wait, wait, move forward. Half of Dark Souls fights felt like that. It was like, hit, hit, roll, hit, roll back up, shoot, roll. It was a very specific kind of gameplay that did not appeal to me.

So, I was trying to figure out how to explain to him why I liked Elden Ring, and I finally hit on it. He and I played EverQuest for years, and I said, "I like Elden Ring for the same reasons I like EverQuest." And I waited for him to go, "Okay," but instead, he went, "I'm more confused than ever." So, I said, "Okay, let's walk through why I like both of those games and how they're similar."

First of all, both games, EverQuest and Elder Ring, have brutally hard combat, like punishingly hard combat, combat where you make a mistake, you die. However, both of them had the same element in that if you did die, you usually knew why you were being killed, and it was usually your fault, like, "Oh, I saw him start to cast that. I should have stepped out of the way," or "I didn't get this combo off fast enough." It was usually, it was almost always, "Okay, that was my fault," which I liked. I'd rather have it be my fault than go, "Oh, killed again by lag," or "Killed again by random number generator."

Both of the games put very high-level creatures in very low-level zones. I was thinking of the Tree Sentinel that you encounter like right when you step outside in Elden Ring, and it made me think of the Griffins in East Common Lands or Doug Griffin, I guess there's only one, that you are literally like level four or five, and you step into East Common Lands, and the most you've dealt with are low-level skeletons, and you see it in the distance, and you're walking through a forest, and Bam! You're one-shotted by a griffin that flew in, and you never saw coming.

Soloing, it was that kind of you're always in danger no matter where you are that made those games feel they put me on edge in a good way. Both games are also soloable, eminently soloable. However, with both games, some classes are easier to solo than others. For example, in EverQuest, The Necromancer and the Druid were eminently soloable, the first one because it had a really good pet, the latter because it could kite. Elder Ring had a very similar thing. I started with a melee class and was having a lot of trouble. I switched to a magic class, mowed through several zones that had caused me so much issues with the melee player. And I'm not saying the game is designed a certain way; it's just for me way easier with a magic-using class.

Similarly, both of those games got easier with multiplayer. Once you joined a group or once you went through with somebody to attack, you know, if you joined had someone help you to take on a boss, so much easier, like orders of magnitude easier. However, both games suffered from other players being able to grief you really badly, and in fact, I noticed that there are some of them in Elden Ring were using the same techniques and I'd seen 25 years before in EverQuest, including System Design, having someone trick you to go into a really bad area and get killed, or telling you you can go somewhere and it's safe that's environmental and know you fall to your death, or attacking you and then going somewhere you can't get to where you can't figure out how they got there, especially if you're a melee class, and they're like, "Okay, they're up on something, and I don't know how to get up there," and they're shooting supposedly.

So, yeah, from software probably could have looked into that a little more because I mean when I was playing, I was like, "I've seen these griefing techniques before." One thing I thought, and I'm gonna be careful how I say this, both games had system design elements that many people call bad, and I just thought of as these have been used before, and people did not enjoy them. The first one that hit me that was really hard was losing XP when you die. EverQuest did that. Elden Ring does it. WoW started out doing it and then got rid of it, or they made it so you get says Resurrection sickness, and then a few minutes later it's gone. Nobody really likes that. Nobody likes losing a level because you die. I feel like I've done this; I've been through it now.

A similar thing, both Elden Ring and EverQuest had fan bases that support that decision wholeheartedly. Okay, it's one of the things that made me not like those games, but overall, I love them. Another thing that really, really confused me was the letter, the weapon grading system. When you get a new weapon in both games, you want to know, is this better than the one I've got? And I don't need it to be a monotonic function. I don't need this weapon is obviously better than this one because it's a 97, and this one's a 96. But I would like to understand what I'm seeing in a weapon so I know, is this good for me? Elden Ring used letter grades, A through E plus S, and by the way, E is worse than A, but S is better than A. So, I mean, that was one of the things I'm like, "I do not understand this at all." EverQuest weapons, by the way, were so complex and so hard to compare that people made online tools that you could type in the name of the two weapons, and it would tell you, "Okay, this is what they do. These are classes that would use them. This is a build that may like it over this one." Basically, way too complicated, way too complicated, which leads me to my next one, which is both Elden Ring and EverQuest had things that were so complicated and so obtuse and so poorly explained that you would go look online to figure out what was going on.

For Elden Ring, I was four hours into the

 game and still hadn't leveled up, and I was like, "What is going on?" I finally had to go online and look up that you not only had to find a specific side of Grace but rest at it. It wasn't enough to find it; you had to rest at it, and only after that did you get a cinematic that then somehow opened up leveling, you know, the most basic function of any RPG, leveling up, starts the game locked off. And I thought, "I don't know who thought of that. I would rethink that." Both games, by the way, make you search for spells if you're a magic class, and they never tell you what spells are available or where they are. You just have to find them. So, inevitably, everybody just goes online and looks up where they are and where they should get them because they weren't randomized, but it was one of those things that I'm like, "Would it have been so bad to have made spells aspirational that whenever you get a spell, maybe that person says, 'And the next spell was given by trainer Bob in this hard to find location.'?" I don't think that would have been awful to do, but hey.

Both Elder Ring and EverQuest, I found to be wildly inconsistent in their combat, both by level and class, pretty much actually by any axis you may choose. Some low-level creatures were really tough; high-level ones weren't. Bosses, some of the bosses I found trivial for one class, but they might go online, and people were saying how hard it was, and they were playing a different class. Some bosses had these really like one-hit kills, but you had to be within a certain range, and so if you're playing a range class and you just stay out of that range, you're fine. Some fights in Elden Ring were really easy on horseback but really hard on foot; you just have to figure that out. Some, and this got important later because you can find those objects that let you summon NPCs to fight with you, some of those bosses were trivial with some of the summons and almost impossible with other summons. In fact, some of the summons hurt you. So, at least EverQuest, in that regard, let you consider an enemy; they had a slash Khan for consider that would give you some hint at its difficulty, but even then, EverQuest also had, you could look at an enemy, and it looked like it's going to be really hard, and for some reason, something you could do with your class, either you could outrun it, you could get on, you could jump up to something they couldn't get to, or something that lets you take them out easily. I liked that.

Both games let you go to any zone you want at any time; they didn't really block them off. And because of the previous point I made, were some creatures were just easier to kill than others, you could usually attack and kill some of the creatures in that new zone, even if that zone is higher level than you. You can usually find some creatures you could attack. Of course, it also meant you were always at risk for finding a creature that would one-shot you, but that's part of the appeal of the game. The clincher for me that really made me go, when I was playing the Elden Ring, "I am playing EverQuest," was when I found the mimic Veil, which lets you transform into a nearby inanimate object. This was exactly what was I could do with one of my favorite classes in EverQuest, the enchanter, where I would cast a spell, and you would just turn into something like a torch or a campfire or you know a shrubbery. It was fun; it was really fun in EverQuest where there were other players to see you do it, but I liked doing it in Elden Ring as well, but that was the one that made me go, "I need to look back at this game because it's making me think of EverQuest."

Morrowind, there was one other thing before I'm done because I know I've been rambling a lot about Elden Ring and EverQuest. There was something about Elden Ring that made me think of Morrowind. I mentioned in a previous video I played a lot of Bethesda games getting ready for Starfield, and I played Morrowind. When I was playing Morrowind, there were things I loved about it, and then I went, "Wow, this is like Elden Ring." A big open world, no quest markers, you have to find quest givers and then remember where they were and where they told you to go. There were no indications of how your decisions were going to affect you in the future; you just had to make a choice and live with the consequences. And then finally, both Morrowind and Elden Ring had big annoying birds that could attack you from above and kill you. I'm not saying I love that, but wow, did it make me think of Morrowind when I got to that point.

Anyway, I know this sounded kind of negative, but I really did enjoy Elden Ring, and I think part of the reason that open world, I could choose where I wanted to go, I could choose what I wanted to attack, I could choose how I wanted to outfit my character, that made Elden Ring much more appealing than the souls games for me. And I think I had tried the souls games and not really enjoyed them that much, but I really loved Alden Ring. So, I think when I finally got through this, my friend understood why I consider Elden Ring and EverQuest very similar games. Anyway, I hope you found this enjoyable to hear me ramble about two very different games and how I found them to be similar.

Emergent Gameplay.md

https://youtu.be/jWEuSV_nbfA?si=COIOkovNbG-1g0Yp

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim, and today I want to talk about emergent gameplay. Jeffrey Sherman asks recently, "I have become entranced with emergent gameplay after a bit of thinking on it. I feel like a fair amount of your games have offered it, and I'm curious if it is considered when making a game and if it is, how much? And is it style-dependent, e.g., CRPG, ARPG, etc.?" 

I like this question. I'm actually surprised I haven't really talked about it. I certainly haven't made it the topic of a video, but I mean, I just start off by saying I love emergent gameplay, and that's obviously why it exists in all of my games. It's something I saw happen on tabletop, and it happens just so organically there, that was something I wanted to make happen in my computer games. Now, we should probably define it. So, emergent gameplay is when there are things a player can do that arise from the mechanics but weren't necessarily part of those mechanics or were planned for by the designers, or at least explicitly planned for.

Now, when I say that I like emergent gameplay and it was in a lot of my games, I'm not speaking for everybody on those teams. There were a lot of people who did not like emergent gameplay. Emergent gameplay causes a lot of unpredictability for the designers and for narrative designers who have to write story and dialogue, and for system mechanics designers who are trying to plan for things that happen so they can set flags and have reaction to it in the game. Letting the player mix up mechanics and do things that weren't planned for makes all of their jobs much more difficult. Now, I think it's a good kind of difficulty. It's kind of a challenging kind of difficulty that if you do the reactivity based on one of these mechanics, if you, even though you didn't know what the mechanic was, you put enough reactivity in that you catch it, people love it.

Now, I'm not going to talk about any other genre than RPGs, computer RPGs, because I haven't made any of those other games, but I've seen it happen, and I love it in those games too. So, let me walk through kind of how I think it happens and how it happened for me and how we handled it, and also some places where I wish they had handled it in other games.

So, let's talk about Fallout. In Fallout, we had emergent gameplay. Some we expected to happen, and others we didn't. For example, in Fallout, once we put explosives in, and explosives could damage anything in their radius that had health, that's when we did things like give doors or locks on doors hit points because we knew that a that meant they could be attacked, and anything with an AOE would do damage to them, and we knew that people would use explosives to get through doors. The nice thing about it was, once we did that at the systemic level in code, we didn't have to special case it. Any door that you could break down, you could use an explosive to get through, and that was just a good thing.

The one thing I've mentioned a lot, which was of the emergent gameplay that we did not expect, was pickpocketing. In pickpocketing, and I was the one who implemented it, I had to get it done quickly, and I had already done bartering, so that UI already existed, and I thought, I'll be clever and I'll use the same UI and just put a flag in saying, hey, you're pickpocketing, so there is no when you say you're done, it doesn't go and check your barter skill to see if the guy accepts it and how much money or whatever, how what his reaction is to it. It instead, if you're pickpocketing, it just takes it, and it rolls to see against your skill to see if the person notices. All that was exactly what we thought was going to happen. What someone in QA discovered was, because it was bartering, I could put things to go into them. I could not just take things. I could put things back, and that's how they figured out that they could put items inside an NPC's inventory. Of course, they started doing it with grenades and explosives and then moving away and watching that NPC blow up.

When they discovered that, we decided to leave it in, and in fact, I think we ended up using it as a means in later quest to do implanting incriminating evidence, but it was not intended. So, that's an example of emergent gameplay that we discovered before it shipped, and we loved it, and then we started making use of it. But then, other things, of course, people discovered all kinds of things, especially when I watch speedrunners Fallout and realize we didn't keep track of whether you ever got a water chip, so people can speedrun Fallout by just ignoring the whole water chip quest line and just killing the mutant army and then killing the master, and boom, game over.

Now, like I said, we knew we'd have emergent gameplay because we were playing a lot of tabletop RPGs, and we watched emergent gameplay happen. We watched people do things with their characters we didn't expect, you know, try to talk to the bad guy in the dungeon and have such a good skill and make such good rolls that they talk their way out of an encounter. That was cool stuff. And while it's hard-pressed to call it emergent for tabletop, it was unusual that players acted like that. And when we were talking about making Fallout, and we had this discussion in detail before we even did one line of design for Arcanum, we said, look, we've got to provide a rich enough set of mechanics, and they have to be low-level mechanics that basically just define the player does this, this happens. And if you have enough of those low-level ones that interact with each other, emergent gameplay will just happen; it'll just happen all by itself, and you should go for it.

So, the way you do that is you make the code very general. For example, if you have a lock in a game, you can say this lock is actually part of when you make an object that's lockable, like a container or a door, you have to do two things for the lock. You have to say what's its key ID and how hard is it to pick, and now you can lockpick that. The skill works, and it knows what penalties or bonuses to apply to the skill, and if you ever find a key with a matching key ID, it opens that. It sets that lock to open as well, and then you can go take that key ID and put it anywhere you want. You put it in a guard's pocket so it can be pickpocketed; you can put it in another container so it can be stolen from there. But if the object it's attached to has hit points, and those hit points ever hit zero, we mark that object as now open, and we're done. And now any lock in the game that's on something with hit points can be blown open or beaten open or whatever you want to do.

Now, the flip side of that would be because people go,

 well, that sounds, how would you ever not do that systemically? Well, imagine if that you had a particular lock that was scripted so that if a nearby screwdriver was applied to the lock, it would say, oh, you've popped the lock. That's a scripted event. The only thing that it works on is that lock, and the only thing it works with is that screwdriver. I hate those because it teaches the player something that's not general, something they can't use anywhere else, and it makes them start to go, okay, I see a lock, let's look around to see if there's something particularly unique about this lock, which isn't what I wanted. I went to like, hey, you have a whole bunch of different tools in your tool chest of actions; one of them will probably open this lock.

The other thing I hate is when a game states a general rule and then doesn't follow through. Not going to tell you what it is, but a very popular RPG in the 90s did this. I was asked to go find an NPC. When you find them, they're dead. They were killed recently, and the intention was you pick up the body and take it back and go, oh, sorry, here they are, they're dead. But I was playing a cleric, and even though I wasn't high enough level to raise dead, I had a raised dead scroll, and that scroll said it worked for anyone who'd been dead up to 9 days, and I knew this person couldn't have been dead for more than three. I knew it; they were alive and home three days before. But I couldn't raise them from the dead. I'd cast the scroll, click on the dead body, and it would say invalid target. I was angry because a) it wasted the scroll; I had to reload, and I lost about 20 minutes of gameplay, but I was I, I remember finding myself as a game designer going, why did they give me that scroll? Someone put it in the game, and then why did they make this quest? It doesn't even follow the rule of that scroll.

I thought what was going to happen is I was a racist person. I was going to go back, and, you know, the person who sent me on the quest like, oh my goodness, you found him, thank you so much, blah, blah, blah. Nope, nope, there was only one way to solve it, and that was to bring back the dead body and go, they're dead. Now, did not like that. Perfect example of a place where an emergent behavior could have happened, and they flubbed it by just not having a generic response, and that's how you cover emergent gameplay that you don't necessarily specifically plan for. What you should do is put in all the code, so you know, you handle a lot of emergent gameplay just you know the explosives blow off that lock now they can get in. Try to react to as much of the other emergent gameplay as you can. For example, if you just added a generic response to the NPC that sent you out on the quest, that if you come back with that character that were sent to find alive, the quest giver goes, oh my goodness, you rescued him. I don't know how you did it, but I am indebted to you. Here, have a reward. That's all you have to say because that's all you know as the designer. You don't, you're like, I don't know how this would ever happen, but just in case it does, let's put in a line for it. We did that in several places in Arcanum where we weren't 100% sure how the player would pull something off, but we put in a line to test for it anyway. Are they back with this person? Are you know, or did they come back, and now this person's dead somehow? We don't know how it happened; we weren't there. We don't have a specific response going, I can't believe you let him stand within that fireball. We just go, oh, he died. I can't believe you let that happen. I don't like you anymore.

The other reason you shouldn't beat yourself up for not planning on every possible way that a player will do something is because you literally can't. If you have a rich enough rule set, you can't plan for everything the players are going to do because players are clever little devils, and they will think of things and do things that you would not have thought of if you had spent 10 years planning this game. Somebody will figure something out. You see it when you look up, you know, you get stuck in a game, and you look up how people did, and you find the most clever solutions of people saying, oh, bring this character and have him go invisible, or break down this door and enter through the back, or disarm this trap, or cast sleep, and they do all these things that are perfectly possible within the game but disable some kind of reaction that you can tell the game designers were planning on.

So, what's my wrap-up of all this? Try to do as much code low-level and generic as you can. Try to react to everything you can. If it's specific, write a specific line, then write some more general reactions that people have that they don't know how you did it because you, the game designer, can't imagine how they do that thing, but you throw in a reaction to it anyway, and then relax. Players are going to be clever; players are going to find ways of doing things that you didn't plan on. Rather than be mad about it and argue about it and fight against it, relax. Let them do it. Let players be smart. It's fun. It's fun to read about how people met the challenge in your game and solved it. So anyway, bottom line, Tim likes emergent gameplay, and thank you for the question, Jeffrey Sherman.

Enemy Progression.md
Youtube Link:
https://youtu.be/6n88lol4IYQ?si=u1Lhy1Ygx9JyYn3v

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim, and today I want to talk about enemy progression. Stagi Ayatollah asks, well, says, "A good topic for the young'uns might be beneficial is your thoughts on how to handle enemy scaling, something that's fumbled a lot these days IMO, perhaps in a broader topic of how to efficiently handle enemies in general." I replied to this one and said I didn't really want to talk about enemy scaling, but I would talk about enemy progression, because I've mentioned in another video that I don't like level scaling. I don't like it when the enemies are adjusted automatically to fit your level, and I also don't like that how it's often done, just as here are a bunch of extra hit points and better armor and better weapons, to the point where you're wondering why is a bandit who's literally carrying around 40,000 gold worth of weapons and armor attacking me? Shouldn't he be retiring somewhere? Hasn't he banded it enough?

So, I want to talk about how I handle enemy progression, which is basically how to make a bunch of creatures to put in your game and have them get naturally harder, how you can set them in to be more difficult, how you can make spawn points that can respawn more difficult groups as you go along. So basically, enemy progression consists of two things, and that's it: more so the number of enemies, more is harder, and a variety of enemies, more variety is harder. And this can be variety in the individuals, you know, like each individual creature can do more things, or group variety, where there are different types of creatures and or enemies, and they can do different things.

So, let's talk about that. I'll give you a bunch of examples, and then I'll talk about a ton of variations you can do. So let's go to the standard bandit. So, the first time you encounter bandits, maybe there should just be one, one lone bandit, he pops out with his dagger, "Give me your money." The next harder one would be a couple of bandits, and they try to flank you, or one of them uses a bow while the other one uses a sword or whatever. Then, the next harder is three to five bandits, now you got a bunch to worry about, and they can have all kinds of different weapons on them. Then you can have the same amount of bandits, but they also now have trained attack wolves, and you have to deal with that. These are things that I think naturally make the bandit encounter harder and harder as you go along.

So, what I'm basically doing here is increasing the number of creatures and the variation. So let's talk about variation, increasing number is easy. Let's talk about variation, let's start with attack variation. So, you can have one kind of creature, whether it's a bandit or you know, a wolf or some monster or whatever, you can give them various kinds of attacks: melee attacks, meaning they have to run up to you, they have to attack you physically. These are things that tend to be parried, they're good units to have to try to flank the player, the player can try to use his parry or whatever skills you have for without shield, stuff like that. Then you have ranged attacks, so the enemies can stand at a distance and attack, whether this is bows in a low-tech game or guns in a high-tech game. It basically means they don't close with you, they attack you from a distance. This requires a whole set of different tactics from the player and defenses.

And then, to make range even harder, you can have AOE ranged attacks, those are attacks that hit and explode to do damage in an area. The reason AOE are good and a bigger step up is they can not only hit the player and his companions, but AOE's are good for getting around corners and behind cover. So something that can, and again this could be tech, it could be a grenade, or it could be something that can breathe fire or acid or something. You can always increase attack variation by giving better weapons and armor, so they go from having, you know, a knife to a sword to a two-handed sword, and that does more and more damage. And you can give them better armor, they can go from having no armor to cloth to leather to chain to plate, but you should do that within reason. Like I said, if something's attacking you and it doesn't make sense why they would have all these things, then they shouldn't have these things.

Another thing you can do to force attack variation within a unit is you can give them limited-use weapons, like maybe they have a rocket launcher but it only has one rocket, or it takes a long time to reload it. So they always open with shooting a rocket at you, and then they switch to a bow, or they switch to their sword. That's a good way of moving things, getting things mixed up. So if the enemies change what they do, the player will have to change what they're doing.

Movement is a great way to introduce attack variation. In addition to things that can just walk up to you and attack or attack from a distance, you can have things that move super fast, that can sprint or that just naturally move really fast. You can have things that can jump, we did that in Outer Worlds, we had a robot that would jump into attack. Units that can hover are really cool, that can go up in the air and then attack you from up there, requiring you to either use a ranged attack or to take cover until they come down. Similar, full-on flying units can be super fun. It's a little harder once you introduce flying units, keep in mind you're going to make it very hard on your melee-only player characters, so give them something they can do, maybe they have to land occasionally to do their big attack, but you have to have something.

Other things include other variations include summons, this is when a unit can bring in more units. Now maybe this is magic, they cast a spell and a portal opens and enemies come out. Maybe it's tech, they pull an alarm on the wall, you hear a claxon going off, and then more guards pour into the room. I've also seen games that have things just birth stuff, you know, they're some part of them opens up and baby enemies pour out. That can be really cool because suddenly it introduces a lot more units into the field of battle, and for players who have attacks that require them to charge them up by hitting or killing things, those new extra units can really help charge those attacks.

Another thing I like putting on enemies are environmental use and creation, basically enemies that do things that exist in the environment apart from them. This could be anything from bandits that set traps around their camps, so if you try to bring, if you try to attack them, if you try to go to them, you're going to have to look out for bear traps and trip wires and all those kinds of things. But also, I mean, it's enemies that are aware of their environment, so they can use cover, they duck behind tables, they duck behind chairs, trying to get cover from your ranged fire. Also, if they have attacks that leave hazards in the environment, that's a cool way

 of adding attack variation as well. So, you can have something that when it breathes fire, it catches things on fire, and if you're near those things on fire, you take extra damage. You can have things that breathe acid, and getting hit with that is really bad, but then it leaves an acid pool on that spot that if you move through it, it's bad, if you stand at it, it's even worse. And maybe they last the whole combat, maybe they only last a certain amount of time and then disappear, both ways you can do both ways and have the ones that disappear be the introduction of this thing and then have ones that stay longer be the advanced version.

So just right here, with the number of enemies that you throw at them, a variety in those enemies, both in the variety of how they attack, move, summon, are, use environmental stuff, or variety of different types, you know, bandits with wolves, bandits with, you know, other types of enemies, like maybe bandits and guards attack you at the same time in some town that's isolationist. Just mixing those groups can be really fun and can be unexpected, having a bandit that has a wizard who summons undead, and the undead require a different way for you to attack them than you attacking the bandits, maybe they need magic weapons, maybe you need holy water. That's a cool thing because just by adding that one wizard unit who can summon different types of units, you've made that enemy encounter much more difficult.

So, I like doing things like this rather than just saying, okay, they've got more hit points and crazy armor now. So anyway, I hope that answers your question, Stagi Ayatollah.

Everything I learned from Disneyland.md

https://youtu.be/MiAEBpXlelk?si=RqoUiP6KV7AvyhXG

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim. Today, I want to do something a little different. All the other videos have been me talking just off the top of my head, but several people have asked in comments about what inspirations I have for game design and if any of those inspirations have come not from games or books or movies but just like everyday activities, and I realized not only do I have just such an inspiration, but I've actually talked about this professionally twice, once to the area Design Group I had at Carbine and then again just a couple years ago to the team on Outer Worlds 2. 

So I wanted to talk to you today about what would be called the top 10 area design roles or what I instead called Everything I Know About RPGs I Learned. It so this could be a little long, it's kind of area design 101, and if you just want to watch real quick and walk away, zones should be simple and fun. Players should look forward to experiencing them, and they should feel worthwhile to play through and to support the story. There, you're done, but now I want to talk about how this is really relevant to or related to theme park design. 

So first, a little background experience or background um on this. I lived in Southern California for a little over 33 years, and for the first 15 years, I really never went to Disneyland. I would go if a relative was visiting or friends really wanted to go. I'm like okay, I'll go, but I found it not only was it expensive, but I found it to be crazy crowded and not just tons of people everywhere, which kind of makes me uh, but huge lines for everything I wanted to do. It was just hard to have fun there. 

Well, two things changed in the mid-2000s. One, I started hanging out with a group of people who loved going there and were really good at going there. They knew everything about the park, they knew the best days of the week to go, the best times of a particular month to go, what to do when you got there like what rides were tended to be empty in the morning like Splash Mountain, but then later on in the day when it was warm don't go to Splash Mountain, you know go see one of the shows, the live shows. And once you go to Disneyland with somebody who really knows what they're doing, it's a completely different Park. 

Um, the other reason things change for me is in the mid-2000s, I was dating a theme park designer, well, an architect who happened to be doing a theme park in South Korea. What was interesting about this theme park, it was based on natural disasters like earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes. I mean, fun right? But it was supposed to be educational and fun. Uh, the ride I designed was a hurricane simulator, and it was basically one of those swing rides you get up, and it spins you around, but it there were uh misters and flashing strobe lights and a fog generator so it felt really cool as it started and everything clouded over. It felt like you were in the eye of the storm, which I think was the name of the ride. Um, when I tell that to people now, they're like well that sounds pretty basic, and I'm like well, you want to know the most basic ride there is it's just something an off-the-shelf thing that takes you through a bunch of window-dressed sets. I just described Pirates of the Caribbean, which is the most popular ride in Disneyland. So there's a room for basic [Music].

Anyway, Disneyland, the people who make these rides are called Imagineers, and they work not only on the rides but the spaces between the rides. They spend as much time on what you walk past versus what you ride, and I think this is really interesting because they want people to enjoy the park and come back frequently and feel like that experience was worth that money that you spent. So that was their goal, and that really aligns with game design goals. In fact, um, the Disney Imagineers, uh, the head of that was a guy named Marty Sklar, and he had 10 basic Disney design rules, and I had seen a talk of his, which is where I made this talk, and I gave this talk as early as 2010, I think. But in 2015, Marty Sklar's rules came out in book form called One Little Spark. I'll try to remember to put a link down below. It's a really good book; you should read it. But I realized that his design rules for Disneyland were perfect design rules for making games. So I'm going to go through them now, uh, there's 10 of them. I'll try to go through it quickly, but this is probably going to be long.

**Okay, rule one is know your audience.** What Marty's Clark said was that means don't bore people, don't talk down to them, and don't lose them by assuming they know what you know. And so this immediately translated into rules for RPG designers, which is if you put in a bunch of quests, vary them up. Nobody wants to do a bunch of escort quests in a row, no one wants to do a bunch of combat quests in a row, no one wants to do a bunch of talking to NPCs in a row. Speaking of talking NPCs, don't have lore bombs, don't have a dialogue that you get trapped in or a cinematic that you can't skip that you put in solely to just throw tons of information at the player, and he's like oh God, I'm in a monologue. Similarly, and this is a rule I had turning all the way back in Fallout, was don't put in cultural references and be very careful with your humor. And the rule for those two things is if you put them in, why do you feel like you have to put in a cultural reference? I don't know. But for humor, especially, is don't put in something so that if people realize there's a reference or some humor being made and they don't get it, and then they feel like they're not part of it. So always put in something that's funny on its surface, but then if you understand it's making a reference or it's a joke at a different level, it's great for the player to go oh, I get what he's really saying, but players who don't get that should still think it's a funny thing.

**The second rule that Marty Sklar had for the Imagineers was wear your guest shoes.** And what he meant by that was he required his designers and his staff, any any um suggested, even the board members at Disney, that they've visited Disneyland as visitors. And what that meant was they didn't get parking permits or passes; they had to experience as a visitor did, drive up, find parking, take the monorail over, get a ticket, stand in line to get a ticket, go in, stand in lines for for rides. And the reason this is important was you have to know what they're seeing. For a a game developer, what this means is you have to play your game, and you have to play your game a lot, a lot a lot before it ships, not just the own the own areas you're working on but everybody

's areas, play with different items, play in different zones, talk to different characters, play different builds. And most important of all, don't use cheats because once you use a cheat, there's no guarantee the game is going to work for you the way it's going to work for someone who's playing it normally.

**Rule three was organize the flow of people and ideas.** And what Marty Sklar meant for that in Disneyland was use good storytelling techniques, and remember that stories aren't lectures. There's a lot of ways of telling story. For RPG design, what that means is I already talked about no lore bombs, but it also means that your story should be very clear and have very clear steps, especially the main story arc. You can fill things in in side quests, but your main story should be very clear. People should always know what's happening in the story and what they do to affect the story. That should be very obvious, and if it isn't, you're doing something wrong.

**The fourth one, the fourth Marty Sklar role, was he caught it create a "come to me".** Um, it "come to me" is a very large structure in the world that you can see from many places. You are the examples for Disneyland was the castle when you first walk in, you see it all the way at the end of Main Street. You can often see the minarets and stuff from different parts of the of the of Disneyland itself. The Epcot dome in Disney World serves that purpose as well. It has multiple purposes. One is to lead visitors from one area to another by creating what what are like visual magnets. Another thing is to give visitors rewards for when they arrive. There's often something to do when you arrive at these large structures. Interestingly, Walt Disney himself called those objects "weenies", and he tells a story about when his dog would go off, his mom would um tell him to go bring the dog back by using a Frankfurter to lure it back. Funny enough, and totally true, I had a beagle when I was very little, maybe four or five years old, who would always escape, and my mom and I would go out with a raw hot dog to try to get the Beagle to come over to us so we could bring it home. So I never realized I shared that in common with Walt Disney, but I think that's funny.

In RPGs, we don't call them "weenies" or "come to me's"; we call them POIs, which is short for Point of Interest. And a point of Interest could be anything. It could be a huge tree that you can see, it could be a mountain, it could be a castle, it could be anything huge that you can see from lots of different places in a Zone. And then once you put in a POI, there should be reasons to go to it. Maybe it's where you turn in quests and get new ones, maybe it's in an entrance to a cave or a dungeon, maybe there's just a reward for going there, maybe just going there um creates a point on your map that you can fast travel to. All of these are good, and those those should all be part of your poi. Um, I used to talk about um, Ghost of Tsushima did a really good job at creating POIs. So if you haven't played that game, it's a really good game to play and see how they draw people in visually to going when they're going to different places.

**Similar to that, rule five is to communicate with visual literacy.** And what that means is there's a lot of ways of telling story non-verbally. So it's not just your narrative designers who should be telling your stories; your area and level designers should be making things with using color. I'm colorblind, color is important, shape, form, texture, just all kinds of ways you can create a Zone to tell a story. For an RPG designer, it means you have to use your art very thoughtfully when you're putting together a Zone. The props that exist aren't just there to dress up the Zone; they should be telling a story. So if the player visits a Zone which was the side of an old battlefield, there should be skeletons and old rusty armor and weapons lying around. You should look at and go something happened here. I think whenever I talk about this, I think Fallout 3 just did a masterful job of this. There were so many places you would go in that game where when you'd enter a room or a small new Sub Zone, you'd look and go I know exactly what happened here, whether it was two skeletons holding hands in a bed, or you find an area where it has a goal, and there's plungers everywhere, and notes about somebody slowly falling into radiation-induced madness trying to create Radix and then somehow getting obsessed with plungers. You can just tell when you walk in like something bad happened here.

**The sixth rule was to avoid overload.** And this is what I just said means you might want to do too much in an area, you will put too many objects here, but too many steps in your story, your quest will have to accept what Marty Sklar would say is don't force people to swallow more than they can digest. Let them have some guidance, and they will go through your area on their own, and they will take it in at the rate they're comfortable with. For us, that means first of all, this is the KISS rule, Keep It Simple, Stupid. Simple story, simple quests, um, and by that, one thing I used to tell people is try to avoid quest objects. Like if you have a quest that says can you take this to Bob, he's in this other Zone, well first of all, that's a new object you have to pick up, maybe your inventory is full, and you can't pick it up, or maybe you pick it up and now you go sell it somewhere, or you drop it. So now you have to make all this special code for all Hero request objects, and they can't be sold, and they can't be dropped, and they don't count for encumbrance, and what would be better if you just said hey, um, Bob here's here's a code phrase I want you to tell Bob, and then her be able to log on to this terminal and access this data. And then you go okay, and then when you get to Bob, you're like hey Bob, Mary said code phrase, boom. If you do have an object, just make it a virtual object. Say Hey, I want you to take system to Bob, and you're like okay, will do, and it doesn't actually appear in your inventory. That's better than having a new quest object with a lot of rules around it. Similarly, if you have a lot of lore to tell rather than have the player be forced through a cinematic or or dialogue, put in a book or a note or a computer terminal, and let them look at it when they want at and read it at the rate they want. Similarly to this, a motorcycle would say only tell one story at a time. So if you have a lot of information, break it down into sub-stories because people will only take in as much as they want. For us as quest and and Zone designers,

 what this means is don't mix a bunch of story elements into one quest, break it into multiple quests, uh, sometimes you don't even have to break it into quests, something could be a sub-task which is kept on a task because it could be just an achievement that they do. But if you do break into subquests, connect them so people know they're part of a bigger thing, but don't try to do five major story advancements inside one quest.

**The eighth one was try to avoid contradiction.** One thing that Marty Sklar thought that Disneyland had a huge competitive edge with is people recognize it. It is what it's called; it has an institutional identity. The public, when they're at Disneyland, they know they're there, and they see things that differentiate it from other theme parks, whether it's characters, color schemes, whatever. For us, it means when you make your game, it should have a clear identity. When people see a screenshot or cinematic that is not identified, they should immediately go that's this game. I see a lot of games out there that like I want to make a fantasy game, and it's so vanilla it's like this could be anything. I have to watch and wait for them to tell me what game I'm watching. Um, it also means that if you're working on a sequel, don't contradict everything in the first game. People love to say things like oh yeah, I'm going to take this thing that we told them, and it's going to turn out to be a lie, I'm going to turn it on its head. Do that too much, and you will lose people. Um, similarly, if you have a Zone story, make sure a story in a particular Zone fits into the old the world arc. Don't, if we're you're making Arcanum and magic and tech contradicted, don't have a Zone where they don't. That just doesn't make any sense; it just confuses people. Just keep things at the IP setting story level very clean and simple.

**The ninth rule was he caught it for every ounce of treatment, provide a ton of fun.** Um, he meant this more since Disneyland is a business, you want people to go there and not go to other theme parks, which means they should have lots of different things they can do there and enjoy themselves and maybe even spend more money. That's why Disneyland has kiosks with food and toys and shirts, and there's shows you can go watch if you don't want to go on a ride, you can sit in a nice little air-conditioned room and watch a live show. Basically, keep your environment very rich and appealing to all kinds of sensory experiences. For us, that's great, you do the same thing. Now, that doesn't mean you have to accept that some grind is inevitable. For some people, grind is combat; for other people, grind is questing. Fine, mix it up, provide a lot of things for people to do. There can be dialogue quests and stealth quests and exploration quests and crafting quests and quests where you're just looking to get items to customize you or your companions because you're tired of the way you look, or you're tired of the damage output you have. Great, there's also tons of feedback you can give people that they're doing good that doesn't isn't just quest completion. There's getting achievements, there's NPCs saying things to you, there's even different um messages you can put on load screens then I was like hey, there's a murder spree in this town, it just pops up, you're like oh yeah, that was me.

And finally, the tenth one Marty called "keep it up", but what he meant was don't underestimate cleanliness and routine maintenance and energy for part of live shows and people who present. When people come to your Park, they expect it to be perfect running and clean, and every show, the show at the end of the evening should be as energetic as the first show of the day because people will comment when they see something that isn't. They don't understand that oh my God, this this stage magician has done this act five times already; they want the sixth act to be as good as the first. For making a game, that means try to ship it with a few bugs as possible and good frame rate, all that stuff. I didn't always do that; I did get better at that over time though, very proud of our world to shipped with very few bugs. Um, but that doesn't mean after it comes out, still patch for bugs and also patch for balance. Players will do things you don't expect, and you're like I gotta balance that. That means having good customer service and good forum support. I know that's hard for Indies, but I think it's just something that's important to do.

So anyway, those were Marty's flowers 10 rules and my interpretation of what that means to do for game design. Hope you like that very long monologue.

Experience & Level Progression.md
Youtube Link:
https://youtu.be/0NHDATFgswY?si=wJ_2zKBDbIhnX4L0

Hi everyone, it's me Tim. Today I want to talk about leveling and progression, and this is actually me answering a question from, and I hope I'm pronouncing this user's name right, Stavros Nicolao. He basically asks, "I would love to hear your thoughts on experiencing experience leveling progression design. How XP is gained, how it's spent, progression restrictions, etc."

So, I've got a lot of thoughts on that. If you've played my games, you've probably seen that I have modified leveling in almost every game I've done. I've modified how you get XP, and I've modified how you spend it. But first off, I want to just talk about there's this idea that floats around about abandoning levels. I've heard it, I thought about it, I basically think though that most players either like or need some kind of gauge, some overall gauge of how they're progressing in the game. So for that reason, I just like keeping levels and keeping XP because it keeps things simple and makes it very easy to point at something going that's what's happening.

So, I'm going to break this down into basically two areas. One, what gives XP, in other words, how a player would gain experience points while playing the game, and two, how they spend that XP, both what they spend it on, uh, maybe when they can spend it, those kinds of questions.

So let me talk about what gives XP first. I've tried a bunch of different things. I've tried giving XP for killing enemies, I've tried giving XP for using your skills, I've tried giving XP for finishing quests. I even tried, if anyone played Arcanum, you get XP every time you successfully hit an enemy, and you get XP proportional to how much damage it took. Meaning, if you damage a monster for a lot of Health but it only has a little bit of Health, it just takes a little bit of health and then dies, and you get the XP for hitting it. If it has a ton of health and you hit it for a lot of Health, you get that XP, a lot of XP for hitting it. This automatically made tougher monsters worth more XP. It divided XP among the people who were doing the damage. There were a lot of problems with this, uh, your companions would take XP from you, in multiplayer the other player would take XP from you. Healing didn't do as good in gaining XP, and something like that, so you then had to put in some system for gaining XP for healing, and then you're kind of just back to I'm going to give XP for doing things.

Based on a lot of this and what I saw, my favorite way of giving XP is for finishing a quest, and here's why. I've talked a lot about how I like non-linear games with quests that can be solved a ton of different ways. I don't want the game to ever impose upon you its way of thinking you should get XP. So if someone tells you to go into a warehouse and bring them back an object, I don't care if you sneak in the back and pick the lock on a window and climb in, grab the item, and go back out and run away. I don't mind if you walk up front, kill the guards, grab a key off of one of them, go in the front. I don't mind if you walk up front, bribe the guard, let them let you in, you grab the item, you leave. Or all the Myriad variations. I don't mind if you go around back and use an explosive to blow open a door. I don't mind if you pickpocket a key off a guard who's wandering around, and then you run over to the door that the key is for and sneak in that way. Don't care, all that really matters is you've got the object and brought it back to the person who asked you for it. So that's why I think XP should just come from quests, that divorces how the player solves it from the actual problem, or which in this case is, do my quest.

So over the years, I've gone more and more towards Quest-based XP. It's what I really push for in Pillars, and Josh went with it, and it's what I wanted to do in Outer Worlds. Now, once you get those rule, once you get the that XP, the reason I think XP should progress in some bar to a level is so that players know how close they are to going up. Just that sense of progression is really important. Then when you go up a level, it's that granular event, you filled up the XP bar, boom, you just went up a level, here are skill points and perks. And I'm talking in general. I'm going to call them skills and perks, but what I mean is, Perks are anything that's very coarse-grained, that has a low range, meaning you don't get 20 of these, you may get one, you may get three, you may get five, but that's probably the most. Skills are very fine-grained in that they have a bigger range. They map to find bonuses, so if the range is one to 100, it may map to a percentage bonus from one to a hundred. Perks are great for things like you can carry more, and every time you buy a perk, it adds 50 pounds. Skills are great for you swing this weapon, and this is your chance to hit.

In general, I think of both of them are things the player, both of these things are things players can get better at, but the reason I put them into perks and skills, in addition to the granularity, is The more I've thought about skills over my career, the more I'm leaning towards doing learning from failure. I think I did a video on it. I've learned, and I know I said this a million times, I've learned more from failing at things than by succeeding in things. I even said, I've learned more from my games that were failures than by ones that were successes. I learned less from Fallout and more from Temple about making games because I failed up more things in Temple, and that taught me how to make games better, more than succeeding at things in Fallout but not knowing why I was successful, and then trying to do some of those things again in Arcanum and not being successful.

What this translates into the game is, whenever you attempt to use a skill, if you fail, some progression associated with that skill is increased. The when you succeed, it doesn't increase at all. What this means is when a progression bar on an individual scale fills up, that's when you can spend points on it. The reason I like this is, this provides the curve that I think is the best curve to have, and the most natural curve to have for skills. When you are not very skilled, you will fail often, those bars will fill up, and when you finally go up a level, you have lots of options of what you want to spend your points on, and you may have to, you may not be given enough points to spend on all of them, so you may have to decide well I want to increase these. That is you keep playing the game, if some of those skills already have the regression bar full, well they're not going to progress anymore because

 they've already filled up, but other ones you're fail at, those progression bars will fill up, you go up a level again, you will again decide where you want to spend these points. Gradually, as your skills get really good, you will fail at them less and less, maybe it's a combat skill, and you're hitting more frequently, maybe it's a lock pick skill, and you're picking locks more frequently, and you're not failing as much, those progression bars will slow down. So when you go up a level, the skills you'll be able to spend your points on would be the ones that you failed at, the ones you didn't increase. What I like about that is, it means you will occasionally go up a level and have tons of skills you can spend points on and not have enough points to spend. I like that kind of choice, but later in the game, as skills progress less rapidly, you might go up a level and not have anything to spend your skill points on yet, and I'm okay with that, you can Bank them. In fact, I think points, whether they're in perks or skills, should be spendable at any point. I don't mind if you're in the middle of combat, I don't mind if you pause and go, I'm gonna, my mainly skill. I don't mind if you pause and go, I'm gonna up this perk which lets me do more critical hit hits with my combat skills. I don't mind if you up this thing, say I'm going to be able to pickpocket even in combat. I like it because it basically reflects that right there in the Heat of the Moment, you had a realization that you could do something. I think that's fun. I think it it feels a little gamey, but I don't care because that's what I think is fun about video games, and I think again, it has the progression that players would like of banking points whether they're for perfect skills and using them when they need them.

So that's another option, you may, you may have tons of skills that could be increased, but you may go, I'm not going to spend any points on them. I'm going to wait till I go in the dungeon, oh, there's a trap that needs disarming, I'm gonna up that skill, oh, there's a lock on that door, I'm gonna up that skill, oh, there's somebody I need to talk my way past, hmm, what worked in the past, I have an idea, you up that skill, talk your way past them. I like that. 

So, if I were to make a game today, I would make you would still have XP bars, and the player would have a level. I would have XP only come from finishing quests. I would have perk points that have that you get when you go up a level that you spend on the on the perks when you want, and I would have skill skills that you can only spend points on when their individual progression bars are filled by failing at them. And I think that would make one of the most interesting progression systems that I can think of, and it meets most of the requirements I have for design pillars today.

So, I hope that answers your question, Stavros.
Title: 
Explaining Non-Linearity

Youtube Link:
https://youtu.be/-MsQItsj-qc?si=x-6xSeOHxeBwOCtv

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim. Today I want to talk about explaining nonlinearity and how this used to be really hard. It's a lot easier now, still has some challenges. This is an answer to a question I got on the channel by Mr. Lars cot1 who asks, "You mentioned Force linearity as mistake number five in your 2016 reboot talk. Can you elaborate on how you've been challenged on The Stance during your career? It's interesting how one of your main RPG design pillars might conflict with the views of other team members, Naro designers, cinematic creators, other programmers, etc. And do you find that developing open-ended sandbox RPGs have become much more accepting by people in the game industry over the years?" So first off, that's a good question, and I thought I should begin by showing a clip of this talk just to kind of get everyone the same page about what Lars is referring to. So here it is:

So the next problem I've had, um, I have a thing for linearity. I don't like it in my RPG. I don't like it if I play an RPG and my friend plays an RPG, and we both have the same experience, and I'm not even talking, you know, even if we made the same character. I like things to be able done in any order. I like you to be able to go to towns in different order and do quests in different order, um, you know, interrupt NPCs and all that. Um, the big thing I like to tell my designers are games are not movies and I make them repeat that after me. If you recognize this game or this movie, plus two points, but if you want to see it, minus two points. Um, sorry, Blizzard, any Blizzard people, okay, um, I love WoW, by the way, the game. Um, so what I tell them is, um, a game isn't like a movie or book or play or anything. It's not meant to be linear. It's not meant to unfold like a book or a movie. I mean, if that was what, what um, you know, a game was, I mean, I can see an adventure game or other things, but I said I kind of hold RPGs to a different standard. I made my character; this game better react to my character and what I do. That's what, that's like to me what's at the core of an RPG.

And what I like to use as an example is I had a scripter on Fallout 1, and he made this area which, if you don't recognize, and I could only find a screenshot where all the Raiders were dead. Now what you just saw, I kept going at that point, that's just a couple minutes. I wanted to throw in, I kept going, and I explained all the different ways that you could do that quest to rescue Tandy. I've talked about that here on the channel. Um, I've even gone into the dialogues that we put in on Arcanum to support those kind of different things. I talk about nonlinearity in game design and in stories. I will link all of those Associated videos that I made below, but this should get everybody out the same speed. This is everyone now understands the context of what I'm talking about.

So, I think what I was referring to in this talk, and I think what Lars is asking about, is very early on, and I'm talking about mid-90s when I was making Fallout, it was very hard to explain the idea of a pure open-ended game to other people at Interplay, and these were game industry folks, and many of them are game industry folks with a lot more experience than me. But what we were trying to do in Fallout was a bit different than the other games at Interplay. I mean, I've even mentioned Stonekeep has a main character who is predefined and has a name and stats, and you have a background story, and he's, he's insert, you, you basically insert yourself into the story, and that was not what I was trying to do. So I try to explain to people, no, no, no, you make your own character. The only commonality is it's a character coming out of a vault, but you can make a wildly different character, and your skills, and traits, and perks, and attributes, and how you treat people, and whether you kill people or talk to them, or even not even do talk to them at all, or what quest you do, and what order you do them, all that factors into what's going on. Explaining this to some of the designers on the team was, some of them got it, we, they played my GPs campaigns, they got it, some of them, it was a bit of a bump, you know, and they kept trying to say things like, well, what if the player does this, and then I make them do this. I'm like, you can never make them do anything.

Um, people outside the project really had a rough time with it. Um, running it through QA at first, we were asked for like, can you give us a walkthrough, and we're like, no, it depends. It depends on what order you want to do things, and what kind of character you make, and what you've already done. We had, um, when the person was trying to make the strategy guide for Fallout, I think he pulled his hair out when he kept going, what's the right way to do this? I'm like, there is no right way to do it. I've heard, and please comment if this is true, that some game players in some countries didn't like Fallout and some of my later games because there was no right way to play them, that they frequently wanted to know, what am I supposed to do here? How am I supposed to rescue Tandy? And it was hard to explain there wasn't no correct way to rescue Tandy. You were just supposed to rescue her, and maybe you don't even have to. You don't even have to do that, but there is no right way to rescue her, and that frustrated some people. It made them angry in a way I didn't quite understand cuz I never played tabletops that way, but there are a lot of computer role-playing games out there that expect you to play a certain way, even down to expecting you to take the good actions, and the bad actions lead to early termination, or they don't even let you make a lot of things about your character because they want to insert you into a predefined story, and I just had to explain to people that's not what we're doing.

Even people towards the end when Fallout was being made, and people were taking it home to play, and they would call me and go, hey, I'm stuck here. What am I supposed to do? And I'm like, well, what character did you make? What did you do before this? What skills did you spend points on? What traits do you have? What perks did you buy? And sometimes they'd get frustrated, go, just tell me what I'm supposed to do, and I'm like, I'm trying to, but some of the things you could do here may not be available to you because your character can't do it.

Um

, by the way, I had very similar reactions with people about the player having to be good or not. There was a mental leap people had to take when I told them the game didn't require you to be good. They meant, Oh, I should be bad. I'm like, no, in fact, the game will punish you for being bad. Oh, so I should be good. No, you should play how you want to play, and then the game will react to how you're playing, and you have to accept the consequences to your decisions. If you act like a jerk, people won't like it. If you kill people, people will come after you, that kind of thing. The game isn't going to make you play one way or the other, and it took some people like, I'd say that one, like, oh, I get it. I love this game. Other people were like, I don't understand, what am I supposed to do? And it just felt like a loop with people. And I think, I'm not sure, but I think that came from what people had experienced before. If you played a tabletop RPG with a good DM that didn't force anything on you, you totally understood open-ended sandbox worlds. But if you had played certain kinds of computer RPGs before Fallout, you were expecting to be told what to do or telegraphed what to do, and that's not what I was doing, of course.

So, to go to Lars's other question about did things get better, yes, things have gotten a lot better. There's a lot more open-ended sandbox reaction-based choice and consequence games out there. But even in modern times, I've had discussions on my most recent games, I've had discussions with people who don't seem to get the concept. I worked with a narrative designer within the last few years who got very angry that their very linear idea could not be forced on the player, leading to discussions that had like him saying, well, once they go in the room, the door shuts and locks and can't be picked, and you can't get out the window, and we don't let them leave until they do this thing, and I'm like, what if they don't ever do the thing? Then they're in the room forever? Wow, it was very difficult to explain to someone that that is not the kind of game I'm making, not that it was a bad idea necessarily, but just that isn't the game we were making, and I found myself having that conversation several times, and it wasn't just with people on the team. There was, um, someone above me in the development production line chain above me who basically was very upset that work was being done that, in his words, some or even most players would never see, which I tried to explain to him that that was a necessary, you know, result of a nonlinear game, that, you know, if somebody played the game with a pacifist playthrough, they're never going to see death animations on a lot of characters, so why are we doing them? If people play the game and decide never to attack animals or always run away from robots or, you know, never interact with some people, people, they're never going to see all those dialogues that are written. And we had a producer, I told you, my producer Eric Dill, just like to shoot everybody he came across, so dialogues, what dialogues?

Interestingly, this spilled over into companions because originally for The Outer Worlds, I wanted to make companions more chained into choice and consequence. So, I was going to make it so that, um, the leadership skill determined like some companions had a minimum leadership skill before they'd agree to join you, which meant you could buy it up, but also the number of companions you could have. I was going to limit it either with leadership or with an Associated perk that you had to buy, that originally you could have one companion, and if you bought a perk, you get another one, or maybe it was an unlock of one of the leadership skills. Um, I really wanted to do that, and I was basically talked out of it because I was again told, this could be, we're doing a lot of work on these Companions, and it would be awful if someone made a character who couldn't experience it. So, basically, I was talked out of doing that with the wasted work explanation. And of course, even to this day, I feel, you know, what, having big consequences to choices player make are good; it makes the game far more replayable, especially when people go online and find out, wait a minute, you know, Parvati didn't join me because I did this thing? Yes, she didn't like that. Or she left the group because of this? Yes, she hated what you did. That kind of thing, I really, I really like.

Now, don't get me wrong, things are a lot better now, um, but mainly because a lot of games do it, but still, sometimes trying to add a feature that no one else does is still hard, and I've talked about this, that sometimes when I have an idea, the first pushback I get is, well, what other game does that? And if I can't think of another game that does it, that person doesn't want to do it in the game. And it's led to me to just say, well, you're the same person who asked me about hooks. How are you supposed to have a unique hook if I can't have a feature that hasn't been done in a game? And they didn't have an answer to that, but other people have said, well, I think the reason you aren't seeing it in other games, there's a reason it must be a bad idea. And I've had to reach out into other genres or other, like, well, we haven't seen this in a game, but this movie did it, and suddenly it was a good idea again. So that still happens, and I think the whole thing with nonlinearity is enough other games have done it that not only I not need to explain it, I don't have to justify its inclusion in games anymore. But I guarantee if you have a unique idea, it will be a bit of an uphill battle for you to get it in because a lot of people think it's not that it's no one's had it, it's that it's a bad idea. So luckily, nonlinearity is no longer in that category. So I hope that answered your question, Mr. Lars cot1.

Extrovert or Introvert.md
Youtube Link:
https://youtu.be/FT0fLk0WjZA?si=pzjZt2N88osXtmT4

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim. Today, I want to answer a question from echoness, who asks, "Tim, which type of Personality are you, introvert or extrovert? Even though people can be super talkative about their passion, they can still be an introvert from the inside out. I'm curious if you're introvert, how do you handle, how do you navigate your work that requires endless communication?"

Oh, econest, you have activated Tim Kaine story time because I have an answer for this, but it's a little long. So, go get coffee if you need it. The short answer is, I'm both, and I can switch back and forth. That's all you wanted to know, tap out now.

Here's the long answer. So, my parents were very different. My mom was an introvert, super smart, really smart. My mom worked for the Judge Advocate General, JAG, high security clearance. My mom rarely made jokes. But, I have four brothers and sisters, so all five of us, actually four and a half, all of us have my dad's sense of humor, which my mom would laugh at but rarely ever make a joke in that style.

And so, of course, my dad was a huge extrovert. He worked in public relations at Western Union, so he was always the life of the party. He was very much, I described in people as Ed McMahon, he was always going "Oh!" That was my dad. When I was really young, I was very introverted. I would go to school, loved school, would just study, do well in my classes, come home, spend the afternoon either by myself or with my brother, who was two years older.

In fourth grade, my mom got caught in on a parent-teacher conference right at the beginning, and she was told that I had tested out of all the fourth grade material, all the fifth grade material, and I was well into the sixth grade material. And they wanted to jump me forward two years. My mom basically put a stop to that, and she said, "I understand he can do the work, but he's already at the tail end of his class age-wise." I was born in late August, so if I'd been born two weeks later, I would have been in third grade, I would have missed the cutoff, which is the beginning of September. I would have been in third grade instead of fourth. So she goes, "He's already younger than everyone else in the class, fourth grade now you want to put him in a class of people who are two to three years older than him. I don't think he's socially ready for that." You know what, she was right. I'm glad she did that. However, the school, and I can't believe this was happening, this is back in the '70s, they pushed really hard for this. So my mom compromised.

He said there were three classes, math, reading, and science, that I could jump forward in, but I'd still be in fourth grade. Basically, I'd leave the room to go do those classes. The, interestingly, the reading class I think was in my brother's class, so I would literally go into my brother's classroom, and yeah, I don't think he liked that. But that was interesting because you know it was, I was suddenly surrounded by kids who were 12, and I had just turned 10.

And for the other classes, for reading, they didn't have a class, but there were a few other kids who had tested out of reading. I think there was a total of six of us, so they would send us to the library, and the librarian there would give us assignments. She'd have us read advanced books and do book reports. One week, we showed up on Monday, and she put down the New York Times Sunday crossword puzzle in front of us, these are all 10 and 11-year-olds, and said, "You could work on it as a group. You have all week, but you have to turn it in at the end of day Friday as complete as you can get it."

We jumped on that. I was friends with a girl; she was Norwegian, Cotton. She coordinated everything. She wrote down all the clues, what the, how, and how long the answers were in letters. She would assign them to us. We'd go jump, look in magazines, newspapers. We'd run around the library looking at, looking up those clues, and as she learned letters, she would tell us, "Okay, these letters in your clue are known." And she was really good. When she got an answer, she'd check them. If they didn't fit, if they missed a letter, she'd say, "No, this doesn't work. It's a letter too long, or these letters don't agree." And she'd look at the two clues and make the people who she had assigned to him go back and check. It was awesome. We finished it, barely. I think we made it with like 20 minutes to spare on Friday. We turned it in, and I think the T-shirt was really, really surprised.

For science, we ended up going to a special science class, and it wasn't good. I loved science, but I'm not, I didn't really love that class. But it was interesting because I got a taste of what it was like to have to work in groups. I can't say that's what made my extroversion come out, but I had a teacher tell me that I seemed really good in groups and working with people, and I won an award for civil something, Civics. I don't remember, citizenship, that was it.

Later, when I got older, my extrovert side did come out when I got to high school, when I started playing D&D. I was one of, usually DM, so I was one who was coordinating the group and telling the stories and running the adventure. And then later, when I went to college, I had to do group projects because I was in engineering school, and that just happened. Then when I went to grad school, in the late '80s, early '90s, when you're in grad school, you have to be a teaching assistant, which means you're put in charge of classes.

The very first year I got there, I was 21, living in California, nobody, didn't know anybody, didn't have a relative living within a thousand miles. I was put in a 300 person introduction, introduction to computer science class, and after the first week, the teacher said, "I need to go away for two weeks, you need to run the class." Gave me his notes. I ran this 300 person class for two weeks, terrified at first, but it actually went pretty well. I mean, it's intro to computer science, and I think it was taught in basic. But it was a known amphitheater with 300 people, and I'd had to get up and teach lessons, and that quickly burns any stage fright or fear of talking right out of you.

So by the time I got to Interplay a few years later, running a project, not a big deal. I was prepared for that. So, yes, when you run a project, you do

 have to be prepared to do a lot of talking. People, you need to tell people what you expect, what you want them to do. You're the one, more than anyone else on the project, who will convey the tone and feeling and vibe, because people will do good work, but if it doesn't fit the tone or vibe of your game, you have to figure out a way of telling them, "This is an excellent piece of code. This is a great idea for a feature. What a great piece of art you did. It doesn't fit in the game."

And you have to learn how to do that, and it's hard. I'm not going to say I always did a great job at it, but I think I got a lot better as time went by, and I think I did better than some of the other project leaders I saw because it's hard to, especially when projects got bigger, when they went from, you know, it was me and four or five people, to 10 and 12, to 30, to 100, to 200. Keeping that many people tasked and moving in the same direction and avoiding pitfalls and necessarily redoing work when needed, it takes a bit of conversational skill. So I think that was something that I got better at.

But the thing I really liked was, and this is what your question made me think of. So my sister, who's eight years older than me, was in college when I was in high school. And she had a psychology class, and they gave these take-home tests, and one of them was, "Are you an extrovert or an introvert?" And it was 100 questions. And when you were done, you could have a score of anywhere from negative 100, pure introvert, to 100, pure extrovert. I took the test; it's a long test, took a whole afternoon to take. I scored a zero. I remember my sister looked at it and went, "Hmm."

So we waited a few weeks, and I took it again, and I scored a one. Now, this is on negative 100 to 100. The description for my personality trait was, "You are just as comfortable going out to a party as you are staying home and reading a book." And I think that's a perfect description of my personality. For the last three years, I've pretty much been in isolation up in Seattle, except for a little bit of part-time work at a few clients. I spend most of the day not talking. You know, walking the dog, gardening, playing around with my game toys that I'm making in Unity and Unreal. And that's fine. I'm fine with that. Then I started doing this channel, which requires me to come up with topics and every morning, sit down and talk to a camera like this. I'm fine with that. People say, "Hey, do you miss work?" A little bit. I miss the people. Kind of miss the work a little bit. I don't miss the stress. I don't miss the pressures.

So, I think that again just says I'm somewhere in the middle. I'm not an introvert; I'm not an extrovert. I can switch it on and off. I can be my introverted mom; I can be my extroverted dad. That's just how it seems to work. So, I hope this answered your question. I hope it explains a little bit of why I do this. But most of the day, I'm a very quiet, insular person. So, there you go.

Fallout Criticals.md
Youtube Link:
https://youtu.be/CvVWp8DmD9I?si=6DQokPooBzvxs-x6

Hi everyone, it's me Tim. Today I want to explain exactly how criticals work in Fallout, and by criticals, I mean both critical successes and critical failures. This is sort of a follow-up because someone asked about this when I explained how all the Fallout attributes work. So, I want to go through exactly how we coded it. My notes are really clear on this, so I'll go through.

Just so you know, there was a critical hit or failure is called an outcome. The success outcomes were based on where you hit the target, so that's why called shots were important because you'd get a different hit effect if you hit someone in the head versus hit someone in the torso or in the groin. The failures were all based on the type of weapon you were using. Both Critical Hits, critical successes, and failures were both based on the roll you did, and I'll talk about that now. All the outcomes had a damage multiplier, which was done in units of one half. So if the damage multiplier was 2, that meant 1.0, so there was no it was the damage was the same. So if you saw damage of one, that way you only did half damage. So a 3 was 1.5, a 4 was 2.0. The reason we did this is integers were far less bytes to store than a floating-point number, and it was frequently we used things like threes and fours on a critical success to mean I did 50% more damage or I did 100% more damage because you did 1.5 or 2.

There's also a list of effects that would happen if the successor failure happened, and there could be multiple ones. They were done as flags, so there could be multiple effects at once. Also, critical successes had something additional, which they had a stat that the target had to roll against, and if they failed, there was a secondary list of effects that could be applied.

Now, critical successes and failures were both calculated the same way. There was a percent chance that it would happen based on the roll you had, and it was the amount you rolled above or below what you needed to hit, divided by 10. So if you needed an 80 and you rolled a 70, that was a 10% chance. If you roll a 60, you had a 20% chance. If you rolled a 90, remember, failures are high. If you rolled a 90 and you had an 80 chance to hit, then that was a 10% into failure, so you had a 1% chance of failing.

For just success rolls, the chance of succeeding was also, you also added in your pure luck score. Now, because the range was 0 to 100, that meant the best you could have is a 100% chance to hit and roll a zero, which means that's 100, the 100 divided by 10 is 10. If your luck was 10, that meant you could have a 20% chance of getting a critical right there. That meant luck tended to dominate this because usually, we're talking you have about an 80% chance of hitting, so the best you'd have is an 8% and then luck would add in to that. So luck was usually proportional to your chance of getting a critical critical success, but often luck was higher, so somebody with high luck tended to get a lot more critical successes.

Luck was not a factor in critical fails in this way, but I'll explain how it works. The other thing I want to point out is I turned off all criticals, all critical successes, and critical failures on the first game day you played, meaning in those caves, and if you probably had a random encounter between the caves and Shady Sands, nobody got a critical success or critical failure, not you, not any of the creatures. Why did I do this? Psychology. There is no difference between getting a critical failure on your first roll and then getting 100 hits in a row. It's identical mathematically to getting 100 hits in a row and then having a critical failure, but psychologically, I discovered very early on when we were QAing that that initial critical failure if someone started the game and immediately had a critical failure, they would be in my office saying your random number generator is wrong, it's stupid, you don't know what you're doing, you better fix this, it's a bug, I'm gonna keep reporting it until you fix it. I could show them the code. I could show them how the random number generator worked. Didn't matter, I was wrong, they were right. Finally, I just stopped wanting to have this conversation, so I disabled criticals. Interestingly, while people kept coming to me and complaining they were starting the game and instantly failing, no one noticed they had no critical successes either, and I'm like, good, that psychology thing works both ways. So the game ships with that. I remember putting it in.

So the way critical success was processed was exactly like this. So if the critical success was rolled because of the attack, which was used basing the skill of the attacker plus any bonuses they got, they then rolled a number one to a hundred and added the better crit perk. I think you got plus 20 to this roll for every level of that perk you took. So this number mapped to six outcomes, roughly every 20, plus one for if you've rolled higher than 100, you could only get it if you were getting some kind of bonus. And then that was looked up, those six outcomes, based on the location you hit the person. So every creature had a critical success chart on hitting them that was divided up by their location, and each one of those locations had six outcomes. So the effect, it would read the effect, and remember, it could be more than one effect, and those would be applied, and then would roll against the target's stat that was indicated for that location because often in the head, it was, it was mostly rolling for endurance, but I think when you got hit in the head, it rolled against luck.

So that luck would factor in. And if the target failed to roll, then extra effects got applied, and I said these could be stacked. So, for example, an attack might say, I bypass armor and knock down the target. So that happens, but then it says they have to roll against their endurance, and if they fail, they'll also be knocked out, which means there's a possibility they were, they had their armor bypassed when damage was applied, and they were knocked down, and they were knocked out, so all those could happen. Also, note that some creatures in the game were marked as immune to critical successes. I don't know all of them that were. I only know the Overseer was. So I don't know who what else, but the Overseer, you could not critically succeed against.

Critical failures, of course, were a little different. They still had outcomes, but they were based on the weapon type. So a pistol would fail differently than a dagger, which would fail differently than a missile launcher. Again, the player would roll one to a hundred, but this time would be adjusted by luck. The roll would go down for every for points of luck above five, and the roll would be adjusted up for luck under

 five because remember, high rolls are bad when you're critically failing. These things matched to five outcomes, roughly every twenty percent. There was no special outcome if you rolled over a hundred, which you could if you were really unlucky, but we didn't have a special failure. Then the effects were applied. It is possible that some of the weapons for the lowest roll possible didn't have any effects, so I would say you critically failed, but nothing happened. Also, just like critical success, those effects could stack, so it's possible that based on your weapon, you could hurt yourself and then fall down.

Again, some creatures were immune to critical failure. I know the Overseer couldn't critically fail. Now, this is talking about when you fought the Overseer when he was in his console that rose up and down and had machine guns. The Overseer who was out in the hallway when he told you to leave at the end was a different Overseer.

And then finally, those effects would last for a certain duration. Things like being knocked out, those were endurance controlled, the higher your endurance, the less you were knocked out. However, some things lasted until they were healed. So if you got your arm crippled, say, or you were blinded, that lasted until you had someone use the doctor skill on you and heal you. Usually, for NPCs, that didn't matter because if they ever got knocked out or crippled or whatever, usually just killed them, or it was a random encounter, and you never saw them again. So this really just mattered for the PC, but the NPCs use the same rules. That, as far as I can tell, is exactly the process of critical hit, critical successes, and critical failures in combat in Fallout. So, I hope that answers lots of the questions that people have been asking.

Fallout Cut Content.md
Youtube Link:
https://youtu.be/gg8vcogc328?si=PFENBAsm4Fdu-gJl

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim. Today, I want to talk about Fallout cut content. This has been a very frequently asked question. People seem very fascinated by what didn't make it into the game, and I'm going to try to answer the question, but I've got a big caveat here.

**Why I left**

When I left Interplay, it caused some consternation in the individuals above me, and I was warned multiple times that I wasn't allowed to take any Interplay property off the site. So that meant I left all the code behind and I left all the design documents behind. That's just fair, I mean, I was worked for hire; they own that. It is a little ironic that a few years later, they lost the source code and called me to see if I had it, and I was like, "Is this a trap?" Anyway.

**Taking notes**

I don't have any of that stuff. However, what I do have is, ever since I was in grad school, I had learned to take notes because you think you're going to remember something, and you are not going to remember it. So, I would write down like if I'm in a meeting and somebody says something, I might write it down. If I'm working and I remember something else I need to do, I'd write it down, knowing that the next morning I can look at those notes and go, "Oh yeah, today I've got to work on this thing." Many of those notes were dated, but because they were in a notebook, even the ones that weren't dated, I have a pretty good idea of when I wrote them. Because of this, I've put together a timeline for Fallout with some very exacting dates. I can tell you the exact date that we decided to do voice over for some of our characters. I can tell you the exact dates people started on the project.

**What is cut content**

So, I went through those notes, and there isn't a whole lot of uncut content. The interesting thing about that, too, is what do I mean by cut content? I'm going to talk about things that were designed but never put in the game because they were deemed not a good fit, or they were designed, and work started, and either the work wasn't finished, or that area was buggy, or for whatever reason, it just didn't end up. So, I've got mostly stuff from Fallout and then one thing from Fallout 2, just because I did it, it was cut.

**Let's start talking about Fallout cut content**

So one of the first things I remember is when a design came across my desk for a Terminator-style robot. It didn't make it past that design phase. I remember having to tell the designer, you know, all of our touchstones, like Robbie the robot from Forbidden Planet, is one of our touchstones. We've already got Mr. Handy and several other robots done. This is not right. And I remember having to explain this is a good idea but not a good idea for this game. 

By the way, that is one of the hardest skills to learn, which is editing your ideas, knowing that something's a good idea but not necessarily a good idea for the game you're making. I always wanted to put ghosts in the den, and I agree with Chris Avellone years later, who said, "Hey, Fallout has enough in it; you really don't need to add Supernatural," and he's right. 

So those Terminator-style robots got cut, which is why I was surprised to see synths in Fallout 4. I mean, Bethesda can do whatever they want, and it's Canon when they do it, but I didn't like them. So, and I remember seeing them and going, "Wow, I cut some things that looked a lot like this from the original Fallout." So it's funny to see it make its way back in.

I know also another thing that people seem to know about are the talking raccoons. I know Scott Campbell has talked about this in some interviews he's done; he called them the slanter or something. I remember them being called the ree, but maybe this is memory getting layered on top. I just remember they were presented to me as talking raccoons that had been exposed to FEV, that got smart, that learned the language from the scientists studying them. This all happened before the war, probably down in the glow, or wherever the FEV was being developed at the time. 

There were two things I had problems with, and I basically put the kibosh on them. One, they were presented to me as little talking raccoons that lived in a hollow tree, and my mind went straight to Keebler elves, and I did not like it. But in general, I don't like talking animals in Fallout. I don't like talking deathclaws in Fallout. In fact, to go to an extreme, I don't like anything that makes deathclaws anything into anything other than frightening, killing death machines. 

The fact that you're attacking a deathclaw at the very beginning of Fallout 4 just didn't sit right with me because it took some of their Fear Factor away. If I'm level two or three, and I'm attacking a deathclaw, and I'm winning, I'm not going to be that scared of deathclaws. In Fallout 1, we had you hear about deathclaws; you were, you know, they were saying they kill everybody. There's something out there, it's killing everybody. You go, and you find some weird eggs, and you're like, "This is weird, what is this?" And then you finally get attacked by a deathclaw, and it's a tough fight, and then you find out that's a baby deathclaw, that's not even Mama deathclaw. That's deathclaws to me. So talking deathclaws, right out.

And because of that, I kind of started saying, "Hey, could we get rid of all the ideas we have for talking animals?" So those things got cut very early. 

One thing that didn't get cut and got designed but never made it in the LA area, especially I think the boneyards, were supposed to have a lot of different themed gangs. I know the Vipers were one of the names. There were several others; they all had named leaders. They were supposed to be fighting over territory or caches of equipment or whatever. There were all these quests that were supposed to be done based on these gangs, and it was just never done. And so it wasn't really cut content; it was content that never got finished. And when those areas had to be completed, they just were completed in a different way. Interestingly, even, you know, I know like a lot of those appear later in Fallout 3 and Fallout New Vegas. There are references to those gangs. I think when you go to Shady Sands, there are several characters there that talk about those gangs; they even name them. So they were planned; they just never got done.

Another thing we wanted to do was we were going to make the Interplay building in Irvine. So that would have been located somewhere between the cathedral and the glow. We were going to design the Interplay building where we're all working, and we were going to say

 that for some reason, it had a generator that was still going, so the emergency systems are still running, so it had like Point defense turrets on it. And the two funny things I remember was, uh, Brian Fargo owned a Dodge Viper, and that was still going to be in the parking lot, and it was going to still look usable, but any attempt to approach it, you would get totally destroyed by those turrets. 

And then the other thing was when it went to when the company, when the building went to emergency power, it diverted all the energy to things like those turrets. So the fobs, these electronic fobs that we had to use to get in and out, that system was turned off, and so when you eventually had to break into the building, you would find there was going to be a skeleton up against one of the doors, trying to get out, trying to still far bits, um, it's fob on the reader. We even, it had been, it was one of the producers, Bill Dugan, he was the Mac producer, uh, it was going to be him, um, he was a character, and we wanted to put him in there, um, you could tell from his lanyard.

So those are the two things I specifically remember. If we had put it in, we wanted to do a post-credits cut scene where it showed the building again, and there's a villager type, there's a guy who's hunched over in the very tan, they walk like this, internally in the data file if they were called the loser, Village loser. We're gonna do a cut scene that showed a loser walking through the parking lot, and as he walks by the Viper and looks at it, the turrets don't fire, so maybe something you did had disabled them, and he gets in the Viper and drives off, just to show you, oh, you could have done that. That got cut for many reasons; we didn't have time, and also it's not aspirational, but um, that was something we were planning to do as an end-credits cutscene.

And then, that was all the things I could find that were cut for some reason from Fallout. However, in Fallout 2, there was something I designed that I kind of missed wasn't there, um, when Fallout 2 shipped, which was the Abbey of lost knowledge. This was, I mean, totally totally based off of Walter Miller's Canticle for Leibowitz. I know Brothers of Steel was based on them, but this one was even more direct. There was going to be a monastery to the north of, uh, Vault City, and there were a bunch of monks there, and all they did was they had manuals and blueprints and technical specifications for technology that they would copy over and illustrate and very, very candical. They were different from the Brotherhood. The Brotherhood found technology to hoard and keep away from people and preserve. These people were trying to preserve knowledge, and anybody was allowed into the Abbey. You were allowed to visit it; they welcomed you in. You could look at anything you wanted; they just said you can't take anything, and you can't damage it. 

I had whole quest lines planned where you would go back to the Abbey to find some important piece of information to advance a quest, or the Brotherhood of Steel discovers the Abbey, and of course, they want to confiscate everything, and the Abbey, the monks there are pacifists, but they don't want to give it up, but you know, maybe they ask you to intervene or whatever. So we had Quest design for all of that stuff, and it just never got done, and I'm not sure why. 

But I don't know what else got cut later. I know Fallout 2 diverged from the original plan, so I'm probably not the person to ask about Fallout 2 cut content. The only thing that I think is a lesson to learn from this, which I've already said, which is I've learned over time that sometimes you just have to let go of content. It's not done; it's not ready. Either if you put it in, it's going to be buggy, or it's going to be half-baked, or the hardest lesson, which is you had a great idea, and this happened to me; it's happened to every design I've worked with. You have a great idea, but it is not great for this game, and that's a really hard thing to get people to see, which is why in later games, I started putting design goals, and I'll do a video eventually on design documents; it's on my list. But I try to put goals at the top of them. It's a great idea I got from Josh Sawyer, and that way, if you're talking about a feature in the game, you can argue it one of two ways. You can argue does it achieve the goal, or do you disagree with this goal. Those are very different discussions, and in terms of this, for example, with the Terminator robots, we'd already decided our robots were Robbie the robot style, so the Terminator robots do not fit. You could argue whether or not they fit. I think you would lose that argument. You could try to argue whether or not our goal of making it Robbie the robot was a good goal, but since it fit in with our '50s aesthetic, I think that's a bad argument as well. 

So, some cut content was taken out because it didn't fit, some was taken out because it wasn't finished, some was taken out because it was buggy and rather than put it in, we're just like, we're not going to do it, and others were cut for reasons I have no idea. I could probably also talk about cut content from Temple at some point. I don't know if there's any cut content from Arcanum; when that game seems to be if we had an idea, we stuffed it in there somewhere. And I'd have to talk to Leonard or Jason, or Jason about cut content from Vampire because I'm not 100% sure what got cut from that, but all that's on my list. I'll try to do that again at some point, but I hope you enjoyed Fallout cut content.

Fallout Nuka Break.md

**Intro**

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim, and today I want to talk about Fallout Nuka break.

**How I got involved**

Fallout Nuka break is a fan-made Fallout-based series web series that was made by Wayside Creations. Let me talk about how I got involved and then what it was like because this was a really, really neat thing for me to experience as someone who's only ever done game development. Being able to watch and even participate a little bit in a film production was amazing.

So, all of it started in October of 2011 in an interview with the game creators Vault and I'll link that below. They were interviewing Chris Avalon, he invited me to come because we're talking about Fallout, and Zach Finfrock, who was at Wayside Creations and was kind of spearheading the whole Fallout Nuka break idea. This was an early October 2011, it was right before I actually joined the company.

So, I drove down from home, it was after I was well after a month after I left Carbine, but I hadn't started Obsidian. In fact, after doing this shoot, I think that's when I talked to them about coming on board. Anyway, I wasn't involved in all of Nuka break. I was just in the second season. I'll link first and second season below. Chris and I were both in it, we both had bit parts.

I didn't know there was going to be any dialogue. I did eventually get some dialogue. I think they were just being nice, but it was fun to do. I'm not an actor, in fact, I'll talk about some of the amazing acting I saw on this.

The first part we shot, at least when I participated, it was shot in two locations. The first one was Eagle Mountain, which was an old iron mine. Eagle Mountain, out past Indio on the far east side of Joshua Tree, but not up at the heights. It was amazing. It was an old Kaiser-owned mine before Kaiser stopped, got out of mining, and just went into insurance. They owned the whole community. You lived and worked and played; your kids went to school there. It was a complete community owned by Kaiser.

It was crazy how much this place looked like Fallout 3. There were homes there, many of which were just falling apart. They were obviously no one lived there, they were falling into disrepair, they were fenced off. Then there were a few that looked okay. One of them I found out was where the caretaker of that whole place lived, and then there were a couple others that Wayside rented to use this kind of a base of operations. One of them we used to do makeup in. You'd go in and like the first day they did makeup on me and then they took a lot of pictures so when I showed up again they refused the pictures as reference to do my makeup the exact same way. The other one, I think people were sleeping there, some people were staying there overnight. Chris and I um grabbed a motel room in Indio, so we drove, we didn't have to drive all the way from um Irvine every day because they wanted us there at sunrise. And that was another crazy thing about the production, to make as much use as natural light they wanted everybody there and in costume and ready to go by dawn and then they would film to dusk, and even sometimes with using lights, go a little past dusk. Crazy shooting schedule.

The second place we shot was in a Santa Clarita gravel pit in Santa Clarita. It looked straight out of Fallout New Vegas, if you remember the gravel pit where the deathclaws were, it looked exactly like that. And if you watch it, that's the scene where I get to shoot someone's eye out because that's right, this is my very own Red Rider BB gun original.

Merrick the Milt got this for me. He, I think he found it in a Goodwill store in SoCal, but he gave this to me and I took it out there. They're originally going to have me use some other weapon and then I pulled this out of my trunk and I said, "Can I please use a Red Rider?" and they were like, "Yes, use that." So, I was very excited.

The production was amazing. All I can say is the dedication to it was absolutely remarkable. Like I said, they filmed dawn to dusk, usually went past that, then they had to go over the dailies. I mean, these people probably worked 14 to 18 hours a day for the few days they were there. But what a lot of things blew me away. Let me tell you first about the acting. I am not an actor, I am not a good actor, watch the series and you will see what I mean. But there were a few actors that just left out of me. There were some really good actors there.

One guy, Vic, and I hope this is named Vic Mignona, he went on to play Star Trek, Captain Kirk in the online web series along with Michelle Specht, who I'll talk about. But the first people I noticed were Tybee Diskin and her brother Cameron Diskin. They were the most professional people. They were always checking on other people, you know, do you have what you want, is there anything you need, are you drinking water because it was hot out there. We were out in the middle of the desert. And I thought, wow, you know, to have this young person come by and say you drinking enough water, Tim? It was like, yes, but it was just really cool how they, in addition to all the production assistants that were there and everybody who's doing these things, they were going above and beyond just making sure everybody was uh taken care of.

But they were also amazing actors and that's what blew me away is that I'd be talking to them just casually, talking to these. I was in my 40s, they were in their 20s, talking to them, then they'd go into their roles. Tybee would, her whole face would change and she'd be doing her lines. Cameron would put on his, he was the ranger, he put on that helmet and everything, but his voice changed and everything and I was like, wow. Where I really noticed this was there's an actress named Anna Rose Heyman, she played Penelope, and I have a scene with her. And we were standing near where our marks were and we were just joking around, talking about things. He was saying what she did for acting, I was telling her what game development was like, and then somebody said, "Okay, we're about to start shooting," and she stepped onto her mark and her face changed. It was actors' faces are so morpheable. She was like, she went like that and she was just... I can't do it, but she was like no, no, we were talking, and then she just went because her character Penelope was really innocent in Sweden, and it's boom, it was almost like someone had done makeup on her or she had put a mask on, she looked different.

But the other one that I, I really, I wanted to meet her afterwards because I, Michelle Specht didn't have any scenes with her. Michelle Specht was playing a character named Red.

 She was funny and scary. She made me think as if one of the B-52s singers, like Kate Pearson, completely psychotic. She looked the role, it was amazing. I walked into one of the houses they had, the two houses there, and she was doing her own makeup. I think she brought her own gun. I was like, "Wow," and her character was hilarious and really good. And she, just like the Diskin siblings or Anna Rosemen, she could just whoop, she'd be Michelle's back and then boom, she was crazy red. It was wild to watch that happen. Maybe this happens on all sets, I don't know. This was the first real acting set I'd ever been on.

**Props**

The props were amazing, especially because I got to see them close up. I mean, Zach Finbrock had made his own Vault suit and it looked good, and it especially looked good on camera. I looked at it closely and like, okay, I see what you did, but it was really good. They also made a big Nuka Cola sign that turned into a weapon called the Nuka breaker. Well, that's what they put it into Fallout New Vegas and called it that, based on that.

Mark Zorin flew in with his power armors, homemade power armor, which looked great. I remember taking pictures of it and sending them to Leonard and going, "Have you seen this?" And he would put it on because it was form-fitted to him. So, in scenes where I think it was Cameron who had to put it on, when they're actually fighting, it's fully helmeted and suited, it's Mark in there because he was the only one who fit.

And then, of course, I brought Old Blue, Red Rider, and I had a scene where I got to shoot someone's eye out, and that was at down at the gravel pit. I was supposed to shoot someone and I say, "Can I aim for the eyes and shoot his eye out?" And so one of the guys acted me shooting him in the eye. I don't remember what I did. I think I just looked over Chris went because it was fun, and I think that made it in.

Anyway, like I said, super long day, super hot, lots of waiting around. You get there and most of you wait around because other people are being filmed and you're not in every scene. But because they weren't 100% sure of the order they were gonna film it in, it depended on the light, it depended on how fast they shot the previous scenes, it depended on if someone wasn't there, they had to move some scenes around. So, I just got there, got into costume, gotten my makeup done, put on that funny hat I had, he grabbed old blue and waited around. I also kept looking at how the cinematography was doing until Matt Ryan, who's a cinematographer, he said, "Come on over and look," and I looked and watched some of the monitors and just how things were framed and how action was planned out and how the actors would be so careful because we only had the one camera. They had to be so careful about staying in frame even though sometimes you're fighting or you're walking, you're acting, you're trying to do things, but you have to be very cognizant of this fixed camera. That was amazing to watch. In fact, the whole thing was amazing for someone like me who's never done anything but game dev. I never did theater in high school, I never had an opportunity to do anything like this. Doing Nuka break, watching all the rolls, talking to people about Fallout. I mean, these people were obviously super into Fallout. They made characters, they made costumes, they wrote dialogue, they scouted out locations, they made props and built sets. It was passion. I'm used to my passion for games, seeing it reflected in them for this other completely different craft. It was humbling to watch because I was like, these people are working incredibly hard to try to realize a dream they're having. And it was just, it was, it was amazing to be a part of it. It was only a little part of it. I mean, I only went two days to Eagle Rock and two days to Santa Clarita, and they were at it for months, but I was super happy to do it. Still tickles me when I show up in IMDb as that character. I think they even named him Tim.

And it was just a fun thing to do in late '91, early '92. No, what am I saying? 2011 and 2012.

So, just wanted to talk about Nuka break because I'd never really talked about it before and I never get asked in interviews about what it was like to be part of a fan film, and I thought it was pretty cool, so I wanted to talk about it here.
Title:
Fallout Radiation vs FEV.md
Youtube Link:
https://youtu.be/RWN6tV3sLU0?si=UipTGrkvlWy9KDTk

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim. Today I want to talk about radiation and the FEV virus in Fallout. And before I start, I just want to say this is my opinion, but if the opinion I had back then and I even looked at my notes I'm like, yep, that's what I thought, and it doesn't really matter what I think because Canon is now set by Bethesda. But I also want to point out that even back then, there was disagreement on the team over some of these, especially Ghouls, which I will explain last because I want to walk through what my take on all of it was and what I had planned to do and make the canon starting in Fallout 2 and later.

So, before we talk about that, I'm talking about radiation, but not solar radiation. And before we talk about radiation, we kind of have to have a brief little refresher on DNA. So, DNA is a double helix of the four purines. All I know is they're A, T, C, and G, and that's how they pair. A only can pair with T, and C can only pair with G. So, you have this double helix, and when sperm and eggs are made, it splits in two and bits go of those go into combine with the bits and pieces of the chromosomes from the other one, and then they so genes get mixed and combined and then they can reassemble because if you have half of a helix and you see an A and a C, you know it has to go T and G to connect. So in that sense, you can say that double helix DNA can repair what are called one-off errors. You lose one of those purines, it can trivially repair it.

The way radiation works in real life, and the way we're imagining it was working in Fallout, was you're constantly being bombarded with radiation, cosmic rays, low level beta decay, just things in your environment, and it will occasionally knock one of those off, and your body just repairs it. Sometimes, very rarely, it will knock both of them off, so like you lose the A and the T or a C and a G, your body doesn't know how to repair that. Sometimes it terminates the cell, sometimes the cell, the helix collapses so now if the gene was spelling out "chat", it just lost one of those letters so now it spells "cat" or "hat", totally different. If that cell continues, it is going to make the wrong things, the wrong proteins. Instead of making chat protein, it's going to make cat or hat protein. Sometimes that's caught and the cell is killed, sometimes it isn't caught and the cell kind of messes up things going on inside your body. Sometimes the way the cell gets adjusted is it now will make copies of itself and there's more and more of these bad cells being made, and you have cancer.

So, that's how it all happens in real life, and we were thinking, yeah okay, that's how radiation is going to happen in Fallout. So then we have FEV, the Forced Evolutionary Virus, and viruses, the way viruses work, and I still debate on whether they're alive or not, is they insert genes into your cell so that your cell will now make more copies not of itself but of the virus genome. So, the virus has genes inside of its genome for how to take over a cell and how to make that cell make more copies of the whole viral genome. So that's what viruses do, they infect you, they make your cells make more copies of itself because it can't do that on its own, and then we have more viruses, they infect the rest, the rest of you or if they you know are getting beaten down by the immune system, one reason you sneeze and have runny noses and you know and diarrhea or whatever is because that's the virus's way of getting out of your body and also your body expelling it so it gets out back out in the environment so it can infect more people.

Now the FEV virus was manufactured, but it was so a basic virus, so you can think of it in terms of that word puzzly I did earlier, it can turn Chat into chant because it added an extra N in there. So the FEV was designed to add genes, but it also did something else very unusual, and that's what I got from the book called Elise, a terrifying tale of immortality. It's a story of a woman in the I think 1700s who, whose mother got or father had ergot poisoning and it led to her being born with a quadruple helix, and it the side effect was it made her immortal. And they didn't really explain it in the book, but the idea I think with a quad helix is, it takes a lot more radiation to knock out all four of those purines that are in a row because if that means instead of just ATAT you have instead of just a T in a double helix you'd have ATAT in the quad, so radiation would have to sleet into that cell and knock out all four of those. Now it's rare enough to knock out two, but it's even rarer to knock out three and much more rare to knock out four. So a quad helix by its very nature would make the person who had it much more resistant to radiation mutation. In the theory, it would also make them live longer because aging is believed to be mistakes in replication. So eventually, your cells age, you get gray hair because your cell malfunctions and stops producing melatonin, you wrinkle, you get other problems because your body isn't making collagen and other materials at the rate it used to. That's not the only reason by far, but let's just say for terms of Fallout, that's what's going on.

However, there's something else that a quad helix would cause, and that is whoever has a quad helix would almost certainly be infertile. And the reason for that is when sperm or an egg is made by meiosis, a double helix becomes that single strand, and then genes can be exchanged and like that, and then it can recombine. With a quad helix, it would break up into a double helix, which has no impetus to recombine. So a double helix sperm hitting a double helix ova would necessarily become a quad helix. You could argue, well, if the virus is still around to do that because it forced the quad helix originally, but if it's still around, then it would probably be doing other things. So the idea was the FEV infected someone, produced a quad helix version of that person, and then and inserted some genes in there as well, and then that was it. The FEV is, you know, can't do anything more in that person and eventually their immune system kills it off like any other virus.

So we ran with that. We're like okay, so FEV makes quad helix people, they're radiation resistant, and in the game, we just made them radiation proof, and then we added the infertility in that with the whole way you bring the master down, and then we looked back at our other because you know like everything I'm going to talk about the development of the setting in a future video, I need to put it all

 in one spot, but things happened organically. So it made us look back at other things and go okay, how do we explain things that were in here? So it's pretty straightforward. Rad scorpions, death, um, giant ants, um, big bugs basically, those were caused by radiation, radiation mutated them. Some of them got really big, some of them grew strange appendages or whatever, okay, we can deal with that. Super mutants, deathclaws, and centaurs, things that were really like weird combinations of things that we know came out of the lab, those were FEV, and we even said FEV works best on things that weren't already damaged by radiation because radiation damages your genes. FEV doubles up your already double helix and inserts some of its own genes. If you're already damaged, that process may not work, which is why the master was looking for unradiated humans. That's what he wanted. He had his best luck with two remains like the lieutenant when he used FEV on undamaged, unradiation damaged humans. If we went to the hub and grabbed people, he'd end up with a lot of his dumb super mutants if it even worked at all. Some people died in the vats.

But this left the ghouls, and just so you know, we all disagreed with it even back then on whether ghouls were radiation or FEV or some combination. I preferred them to be radiation only, and here's why. So when the bombs fell, we already knew what radiation did to people, and we didn't want to change it dramatically in Fallout. Most people got radiated and died. That's just what happened. But because billions of people were being irradiated, what you found was some of them lived, some of them survived it, and they were messed up and looked like ghouls. I mean, they looked horrible, their skin and hair and everything was messed up, but they lived. Most of them had shorter lifespans because they were irradiated. Some lived a normal lifespan, but a few, just a few, for some reason, that radiation-induced mutation made them live longer. And you're probably saying, well wait, we see a lot of these ghouls all over the place. Yes, what you're seeing is survivor bias. The ones that didn't live long are dead. The ones that did live a long time are the ones you're seeing. And I love that because that explains like the glowing ones. They took in a lot more radiation than normal ones, but they somehow don't die from it, so they literally glow from it, and the feral ones are just an example of humans aren't designed to live forever. We don't have brains that can keep generating memory. You eventually run out of storage, our nerve endings are not regenerative. So these mutated, irradiated people, these long-living ghouls, are eventually going to start having problems just because of their long lifespan, and hence we see feral ghouls.

So, I think radiation can just explain all of it without having to stir FEV into the mix, and the adding FEV to ghouls kind of messes up the whole thing we had going on for the master where the master's like I need a pure strain human, I need a human that isn't radiated. So I prefer ghouls being radiation only. I'm sure there's disagreement on that, but that's what, that's where I was going to go with it on Fallout 2 and Beyond. Of course, Bethesda can do whatever they want, but I just wanted to kind of say what that was so people knew. This is what I was going to do with it, this is where I was going to run with it, and now everybody can argue whether that's a good idea or not.
Title:
Fallout Random Encounters.md
Youtube Link:
https://youtu.be/2vOOeJaMyzw?si=ATLd3JxGZQB3gER4

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim. Today, I want to talk about Fallout Random Encounters and exactly how those things work. So several people have asked how they work and what controls them. So as you're moving across the world map in Fallout, there's a chance based on the time you're on the world map that you will have an encounter and it will drop you onto a map.

Now, your Outdoorsman skill determines how far you can travel per time unit. So the higher your Outdoorsman skill, the farther you travel. So when you're picking two points of travel, Outdoorsman makes it less likely that you will have an encounter because you're putting in more miles per day. Similarly, Pathfinder, the perk, says for any particular unit of time, the amount of gain time uh that passes is lower, so it reduces encounters as well by saying you know Outdoorsman says every day you travel more miles, Pathfinder says it takes you less part of a day to go those miles. So both of them reduce the time unit that will be used to roll a random encounter.

Now, regular encounters are based on the terrain, and there are four train types in Fallout: there's Desert, Mountain, City, and ocean. Ocean is anything along the Pacific coast; mountain is anywhere it looks like there's a mountain; um, and city is anywhere there's an establishment, and those sectors are pretty big. So if anywhere in that sector is a uh established location, it's considered a city. Everything else is Desert. So, roll those encounters, and then it checks to see if that encounter should be a special encounter. To do that, it uses both luck and explore level. So luck adds in luck minus five. So yes, your chance of actually having special encounters drops if you have low luck and goes up if you have high luck. And then, for the Explorer perk, it takes the number of levels of that perk you bought and doubles it and adds that to the role.

So if you have a special encounter, then it rolls to see which of the six special encounters you will have. So spoiler, I'm going to tell you what all the specials are, which you probably already know, but it's a 25-year-old game, so it doesn't matter. So there are six of them: they are the giant footprint that has the guy smooshed with a stealth Boy, there's the talking Brahmin, there's the used car salesman where you can get the BB gun, there is the phone booth, it's a TARDIS, there's a flying saucer with the aliens stealing the Velvet painting of Elvis, and there's the overturned nuka-cola truck. The exact chance of getting these are there's a 30% chance you'll get the giant footprint, 20% chance you either get the talking Brahmin or the used car salesman, and then a 10% chance each on the remaining ones: the Tardis, the Flying Saucer, and the overturned nuka-cola truck.

Now, the other side of this is, what was our intention on these? Why did we have these encounters? Well, first of all, we wanted there to be Combat on the world map just to reinforce that the world is dangerous. We didn't want people to be able to just go back and forth whenever they wanted. Um, also the world map, since the world map makes time go by, those encounters will reinforce at times going by because, as if you get dropped halfway through the encounter, you'll see that time is Advanced, and if you had any radiation or drug effects, those things would have advanced.

Second, random encounters were our feedback to the player that parts of the world were way more dangerous than others. Our world map had danger zones on it, in addition to the terrain, so you'd have worse encounters, more dangerous Encounters in different parts of the map, and that was our way of saying, hey, if you head up to the Northwest near the military base, encounters are going to get harder. If you have those encounters, you can turn, you can run away from them. It's easier to run away from a random encounter, and then you don't even have to get to the military base to know you're going somewhere bad.

We also wanted to reward exploration, which is why luck factors in, and the Explorer perk factors in because a lot of those, especially the special encounters, can give you really cool stuff. And we want to reward exploration. We went out, tied into luck, and whatever perks you have, so we did that. Fourth, um, encounters are a really good part of World building. Uh, you don't always just want to have everything in the world fixed, but you do want the player to get an idea of what the world is like. So traveling around on our map is where you're going to be attacked by Raiders and different creatures, uh, the all the different Critters we have, the rad scorpions, uh, deathclaw. Um, we wanted to have those out there to ex to explain to people like there is a lot of danger in the world, and these are the exact dangers you run into. So that way, if you run into Raiders on an encounter and then you get to a Raider camp, this all makes sense. You know, the Raiders just don't sit in their Camp all day. You've actually encountered them out there raiding.

And then finally, we thought this was a really good use of the Lux stat. Um, luck kind of factored into all the skill rolls. I've already done a whole thing about what attributes do, and I talked about luck, but I always really wanted luck to kind of be even meta, so not just something that factors into skills because a lot of thing factors into skills. I like that luck just kind of poked everywhere, and everything you did kind of was a reminder to oh, you're a little luckier than average award, you're a little less lucky than average, and uh, the encounters on the world map just seemed a great way to do that.

And then finally, I want to talk about the fact that we had things like the Tardis and flying saucers and the Red Rider BB gun and other things like that. Yes, I had that rule about humor where I didn't want people to think they were missing out on a joke. So I wanted humor in Fallout to be subtle enough that there was either they didn't notice there was a joke or there was something else funny, and the cultural reference or whatever other references being made just added into the depth of the joke. Yes, that's a little relaxed on the special encounters, and that was deliberate. Um, I wanted them to be a little more humorous. I didn't mind if they broke the fourth wall. Um, I never intended any of the special encounters to mean that there really was Godzilla or the doctor from Doctor Who or aliens in Fallout. I mean, the fact that that some of those have been made Canon, I guess that's fine, it was never the intention. They were supposed to be fun, a little IP silly, a little fourth wall breaking humor, and that was just something I really wanted to kind of let happen just in the Random Encounters, just to sort of remind you the Fallout world is strange and mysterious. But anyway, that's exactly how and why the Random Encounters worked in

 Fallout.

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim. Today, I want to answer a question from commenter Brian Eno. Better be a real name, don't taunt me like that. Anyway, Brian Eno asks, "What's one of your biggest Fallout related regrets, specifically story-wise, or a feature you could never get working in on time?" Okay, I'm going to assume you mean development of Fallout and not like, I regret walking away from the hype. So, I'm going to break that into two parts because I have a different answer for Fallout 1 than I do for Fallout 2.

For Fallout 1, my biggest regret is companion AI. I've talked about this in another video, but companions were added to the game so late in development that there was very little time to get any AI in for them. When they were first put in, they were handled via script, and I think they basically just followed the player around and shared any hostility flag that the player would have. So, anything mad at the player, they would attack. I had very little time to do any specific code for the companions, so they ended up using the code I had written for Fallout enemy AI, the NPCs for that. It was not written for companions to use. There was so much stuff that is funny when an enemy does it, but you don't like it when your companion does it in combat. You know, Ian with an Uzi is a perfect example. It was fun, and you kind of liked it if a super mutant with a minigun shot at you and tore up all of his friends that were standing between you and that super mutant, but it's far less funny when Ian does it and he shoots at somebody with his Uzi on Full Auto and you happen to be between him and his target. That's a lot less funny because we also implemented critical failure in Fallout. Critical failures of your companions with their weapons could be really hurtful to you if they ended up shooting a friend or the weapon exploded or something like that. But it turns out it's not just combat AI that I regret not having time to spend on the companions. There was a lot of code that even at the time companions went in, I made like a list of things I need to get to, but there were other features that were planned for, and also bugs that were coming in that were really high priority, like crash bugs, so I didn't have time to get to it. But I went and looked in my notes, one of the big ones was movement. I there was an ask to step aside that I really wanted to put in, so when a companion was blocking your way, you could say, "Could you just take one step?" and they take a step in a direction that was open, so you could get into a door or access a container. Just, you know, that was the very first piece of code I did when I started on Fallout 2, is that ability to walk up to a guard or someone and say, "Could you step to one side?" so you could get in, and cuz I remember, I that had to be done early because I wanted level designers to have the option for that NPC to go, "No," like if you have an NPC who's deliberately standing in front of a door, you don't want him to move. A lot of companion interactions, especially things like having them giving them equipment and getting them to wield it, I wanted that to be a lot nicer than what we ended up shipping with. In theory, I wanted it to be a little paper doll just like on the player, there was no time to do any of that stuff. I also wanted companions to level up. I wanted each one of them to have a level-up scheme. I wanted them to follow it as the player levels up, just to make them stay useful throughout the course of the game. No time to do anything like that. The other one I remember writing down was, I wish there was a way to tell a companion, "Wait here, I'll be back," so you could go and do something without them and then come back and get them. Having "wait here" would have helped Dogmeat survive the military base and those flickering door force fields. Would have made that much easier. Had no time to do anything like that. Essentially, if you want to know what I wanted to do with companions, go look at what I did in Arcanum. Almost all of those things ended up being implemented in Arcanum, including the level-up schema and telling companions to wait, and you'll come back and get them. So, that's my biggest regret for Fallout 1.

For Fallout 2, it's an entirely different story. There was an area I had designed early on that also got cut early on called The Abbey of Lost Knowledge. I really, really, really wanted this in the game. It was based very superficially and directly on *A Canticle for Leibowitz* by Walter Miller. That book was really influential in making Fallout itself, but I specifically wanted the Abbey as a direct homage to Canticle for Leibowitz. And the reason I wanted it in the game is, it really made me curious to think that there was a different way for a group to revere the old world and Old World Tech, besides what the Brotherhood was doing. I and it was also very curious to me is how, how would a place that was so completely pacifistic survive? I wasn't sure I had the all the answers for that, but I wanted to explore that as the Abbey got developed. I already knew that the quest I wanted them to do would be things like, there of course be things they need just equipment, probably technical journals and stuff, not just to preserve, but to understand what it was they were putting in. They would probably send you out to retrieve things like blueprints and books and actual items. Now the Abbey was as less interested in the items as they would be in the blueprints and the engineering manuals and textbooks that were used to create the items cuz they wanted to preserve knowledge. That was their main thing, not so much artifacts, which is what the Brotherhood was more interested in. But I also knew that because of this, that puts them directly at odds with the brother of Steel, and I expected the brothers of Steel to fight them, although I wasn't quite sure how the fight would work cuz the brother of Steel would just roll over the Abbey. So that was something I expected to happen, is you get to you, you discover the Abbey, they explain they're pacifist, and you're allowed to use anything in there, so you could use that, really cool for looking up things. Maybe we put a crafting system in, but that would have been a cool place to go get information, and other quests for non-Abbey related things could have one step of it could have been, you have to go to the Abbey and find where this secret military base was located, or how this item is supposed to be used, or where there may be a cache of energy cells or something. You could, you could always go back to the Abbey to do research. But I also, as you befriended them, I saw them sending you out in quest to find rare blueprints and engineering manuals and textbooks and things like that, and then eventually, when the Brotherhood of Steel would hear about them, that would be

 a conflict, and they'd probably want you to deal with it. I don't know if that would be you wiping out the brother of Steel, you having to talk to them and reach an agreement that, "Hey, you have to leave the Abbey alone." Maybe you get them to join. I mean, maybe the Abbey can just be a Brotherhood of Steel knowledge vault. Of course, the Brotherhood would want to make that secret and make it their own, but that was something I planned to explore, and I'm trying to remember why it got cut. It was cut, I think it was even cut before I left. There was just so much stuff we were planning to do in Fallout 2, it was a bigger scoped game than one, yet there was less than a year to do it in. Even in February, before I left, we knew it was supposed to be done by that fall, and that is a tight schedule, even given that all the systems and stuff were done. You know, they'd have to be extended, and you know, there'd be bugs, but that's a lot of content to make it about eight or nine months, so the Abbey got cut really, really early in the development process. But it always is in the back of my head of what would I have done with that, and it could have been an interesting way of exploring the Brotherhood of Steel, or reflecting the Brotherhood of Steel, because the Brotherhood of Steel could have been a very different organization, and the Abbey would exist to remind them that there are different ways of preserving the past other than just finding it and keeping it for yourself.

So, those are my two big regrets: from Fallout 1, that companions were added so late that I couldn't support them in code, and for Fallout 2, that the Abbey of Lost Knowledge was never implemented and put in the game. So, Brian Eno, I hope that answers your question.

Fallout SPECIAL Attribute Effects.md

https://youtu.be/VxIisf8fQtE?si=AtK5iB_Gq6wnf3mZ

**Intro**

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim. Today I want to talk about the attributes in Fallout, the SPECIAL attributes. Now, I'm going to talk about exactly what they do. Part of the reason I want to do this is that almost a year ago, someone on Reddit was saying how they like games that have luck in them, and I explained what luck did in Fallout, like in detail, and I realized I had a document that about the time we shipped, or shortly after, I wrote down exactly what all the attributes did, and I still have that document.

**Original Shirt**

But I know I had originally written it down on paper, so I went to go look for it, and what I was looking for, by the way, I found this. This is an original Fallout shirt that still says GURPS on it. I've never even worn this shirt. I found it in a box while I was looking for the paper version of my notes on SPECIAL. I couldn't find them, so this started a broader search. I looked for my original physical notes that I know I had, a few from rags to riches, and I couldn't find those.

So then I went looking for a programming book that I bought when I was in high school, or maybe very early college, that I used on the very first game I worked on, Grandstand Bridge, which was written in C. And I know I had that book. I remember packing that book. I cannot find that book. So I'm now worried that at least one box got lost when I moved up here, and I'm almost positive I know what happened. We moved using a POD because it was the middle of COVID, where they drop an empty POD at your house, and you fill it up yourself, and then they take it to your new house, and you empty it yourself.

The problem was I injured my leg before the move. I had already boxed up the house, but I could barely walk, so I ended up hiring movers to fill the POD, and I had a box of junk stuff and a box of things that were going to friends. And at least once, I found that the movers would bring things down from upstairs and set them in the living room to take out to the POD, but they set it right next to the junk pile, and one time I said, "That's not junk," and the mover's like, "I know, I know, I'll get it." I now worry that one of those boxes was placed really close to junk and was left there by the movers, and then by me, so now it's gone. Nothing's been lost because I digitized all those notes, but I'm really bummed because I wanted the physical copies, especially because I had pictures drawn on them.

So, those are gone. Also means, though, that because I found a bunch of shirts, no danger of me repeating a shirt. I know I accidentally repeated a Spacer's Choice shirt once, so I've already technically repeated shirts, but I can go for a while now. But new shirt, new shirt. So, I thought this is appropriate since I want to talk about Fallout.

The thing about what I'm going to talk about is, I don't know. I'm going to talk about the systemic effects of the attributes. There were scripts that checked your attributes, and of course, they're checked in dialogue, and I didn't go through all of that. I would have to play the game multiple times to figure that out. It'd be a lot easier if I could just search through the files, but the... so these are the systemic effects, and I'm not going to include things like prereqs for perks because that's obvious. I'm going to talk about the things that each attribute does in code, so that when you spend points on them, this is what they're doing. So, I will go through them in SPECIAL order.

**Strength**

Strength improves your base skill in unarmed and melee, so as you up your strength, your base skill got higher, so you didn't have to put as many points in it later. It also increased your hit points, your melee damage, and your carry amount, and those are just automatic. They just added right because those derived stats inside the game. It also reduces your hit chance if you're below the min strength for a weapon. Your hit chance with that weapon is reduced for every point you're below that min strength. Strength also increases the range of any thrown weapon, not a ranged weapon, but anything you threw like a grenade or... we had a couple like I think we had throwing knives and a couple other things you could throw. By the way, that adds to the Heave Ho perk. So the Heave Ho perk increased the range of thrown weapons, that added, that was additive with strength, so if you had both, you could throw really far.

**Perception**

So the next one is in SPECIAL is Perception. Perception improved your base skill in first aid, doctor, lock pick, and traps. Perception also improves your sequence in combat, so when you got your sequence, determined where you were going to go in the turn-based order. The higher your perception, the earlier you went. It also increased the range for both ranged and thrown weapons before a distance penalty would kick in. So normally, the farther away somebody was, the lower your to-hit would become. Perception increases the radius at which there is no penalty, and then it starts to drop off after that. So somebody really far away is less of a penalty if you have a high perception than a low because it didn't stop dropping off until quite a distance, and so it doesn't drop off as far.

**Endurance**

So the next one in SPECIAL was Endurance. Endurance improved your base skill in Outdoorsman. It also increased your hit points, your heal rate, so you healed, you had more hit points, and you healed them faster if you had a high endurance. It also increased your base resistance in both radiation and poison. That could also be improved with consumables or armor, those resistances, but your base, it was additive to your base, and your base was higher with endurance. Your endurance also, the higher your endurance, the lower the chance is that you will automatically be put up to the next higher radiation sickness level. If you had a high enough radiation, the way radiation worked in Fallout, the base game was, you, when you took radiation, when you took RADS, the total was kept, but you didn't automatically get sick. What it would do is periodically it would check, and if you were at a lower radiation sickness level than your current rad level indicated, it would only move you up one. It would move you towards it, so you gradually get sick. So if you took a ton of radiation at once, you'd get low sick, and then a lot sick, and then really sick. That chance of going up each time was reduced if you had a higher endurance. You would eventually, of course, it was never zeros, so eventually would get sick, but you would get sick more slowly if you had a high endurance. And then finally, endurance factored into critical hits in the following way: the chance that a critical headshot would knock you out and was reduced by endurance. The chance that an arm or a leg shot, that limb, was reduced with endurance, and the

 fact that a groin shot would either knock you down or knock you out was reduced with endurance.

**Charisma**

So that gets us up to C, Charisma. Charisma improved the base skill in speech and barter. It also improved the reaction that NPCs would have to you, so when you, there was a base reaction based on Charisma, and then it would be adjusted by things you did, and reputations you could get. And that's it. That's the only thing Charisma did, so I see why a lot of you use it as a dump stat. If I was going to remake Fallout today, that would change. I do know it also limited, there was a Charisma limit on how many companions you could get. Yeah, that was something we threw in, it was, some people hated it, some people loved it. The people hated it was like, "Well, now I can't get companions, and they're super fun." I'm like, "Well, you can, you just can't have all of them at once," and it's not like they had, they talk to each other like the Outer Worlds companions did, but okay, Charisma doesn't do much.

**Intelligence**

So let's go into Intelligence, the one that does a lot. So Intelligence improved your base skill in first aid, doctor, science, repair, and Outdoorsman. It also increased the skill points you got every single time you leveled up, which is a huge problem when you're playing a dumb character because you get so little skill points, and you're already have, what, five skills below normal? And speaking of dumb, Intelligence modified conversation options, not just someone, some of them you can only get if your intelligence was high enough, but Intelligence also, and this is one I didn't see in a lot of places online, Intelligence controlled how long it took you to read a book to get its benefit. So in Fallout, if you found something, you could read it, and it would give you a bonus, but it would fade out and fade in and say, "Okay, you've now read this thing, and you have this bonus."

**Agility**

Time would pass as it was faded out to indicate you were reading. The length of time it took you to read was shortened with higher intelligence. I don't know if anybody ever noticed that. I don't know if anybody ever cared, but that's what it does. So then we get to Agility. Agility is interesting. It has a very short list of what it does, but it is a very powerful stat. Agility improves the base skill in a lot of skills: small guns, big guns, energy guns, unarmed, melee, throwing, sneak, lock pick, steel, traps. That's a lot, but it also increased both your action points that you got every round and your armor class. Wow, Agility was like the stat. On paper, it looked like, "Okay, it only does a few things," but just those agility points alone, or the action points alone, make Agility great.

**Luck**

And finally, that brings us to Luck, and this is one of the things I wrote on that Reddit post, but actually, since I did it, I was like, "Oh, there was a back page." So here's everything Luck does. One, Luck is the base attribute for gambling, so the higher you put points in Luck, you automatically have a higher gambling skill. Luck also increases the chance of a critical success with any skill, both inside and outside combat. So when you pickpocket somebody with Steel, you can get a critical success. When you pick a lock, when you do first aid, all of those can get critical successes more easily if you have a higher Luck. Luck also had a bunch of extra effects inside of combat. So Luck increases the chance that any attack becomes a critical success, but it also decreases the chance of any failure becomes a critical failure. Luck also breaks ties between two combatants that have the same sequence number. So I said Perception gives you a better sequence number. If your sequence number ties with someone, then the game compares your Luck, and the one with the highest Luck goes first.

Finally, Luck increases the chance that a ranged attack, which uses the Sniper perk, becomes a critical hit. So if you take the Sniper perk and it says, "Hey, some of your range attacks become criticals," you get even more with Luck. So it's additive with the perk. Or it doesn't do it by itself; once you have the perk, Luck kicks in. And finally, well, actually, no, that's why there's a back page. So on the world map, Luck adds to the chance that you have a special random encounter, but there are minimum Luck scores, which means some encounters literally you cannot get unless your Luck is high enough. This is why some people would play the game and say, "I never encountered the Flying Saucer," or "I never found the Nuka-Cola truck." If you lower your Luck to one, you will not have some special encounters.

And finally, and this is the one I totally forgot about, when you shoot someone in the eye, there's a chance it blinds them, but that chance is reduced by Luck. So really lucky people will almost never get blinded if they're shot in the eye.

And that's it. That was everything that was on that. I think that's everything, of course. I didn't include perks, and if it was a script that checked it or dialogue, I didn't look. Also, be aware that base Fallout shipped with a bug where you could get critical failures and successes on skills, but you couldn't get them when you rolled against attributes, and that's why there was a... like the supercomputer ZAX in the glow, he checked against one of your skills when you played him chess, and the script would check against critical success, and that literally can't happen. So, don't know if it ever got modded in, but I know that was something that we never noticed, and it got noticed way past when we did the last patch, so I'm not sure. I'm not sure that ever got patched by Interplay. I hope it got patched by modders. It'd be so trivial to fix that. There are a lot of things about Fallout, very trivial to fix.

Anyway, I hope that is a nice definitive list of everything that SPECIAL does in Fallout.

Fallout The Original Intro Story.md
Youtube Link:
https://youtu.be/Ieqw-dwsXIA?si=u36jRksB7_7QB-_8

Hi everyone, it's me Tim, and today I want to talk about the original story intro to Fallout. Let me explain, and I'm kind of excited. So, if you watched the video where I'm talking with Scott Campbell, he mentioned that he thought the Vault idea was mine. I thought the Vault idea grew out of our idea for making the game Alien Invasion, and that people had hidden in vaults, but he said, "I remember you coming up with the idea for the vault after the brainstorming, and that you even said you dreamed about it. Hey, wouldn't this be a great intro?" And I was like, huh, you know, and I scratched my head. I mean, keep in mind, this would have been '94, '95, so this was, we're talking 28 years ago. But then similarly, when I did my chat with Jason Taylor, Jason said that he came up with the idea of the water chip, but that that was well after doing the vaults, and that led me to think, okay, if I came up with the Vault idea, it would have to be after the brainstorms in the fall of '94 but before JT's water chip idea in early '95.

So, I started going through my stuff. I went through tons of archived files and paper notes, and I found it. Both of those guys were right. I found a document called "My Story." I always name things— I had "My Story," "My Character," "My Idea." I really needed to name things better. But I found something called "My Story," it was dated January 2nd, 1995, so this happened after the brainstorming meetings that we had in the fall. Now, after those meetings, we had decided on that the game was post-apocalyptic, and we had ideas for places. Junktown existed. I mean, Junktown. I saw something mentioning referencing a Junktown design document in a production meeting note I have from December of '94. So, Junktown was an early, early concept. We also had the existence of mutants, ghouls, very little else though, particularly we had no idea who the player was or how the game was going to start.

Apparently, over Christmas break, I chewed on this idea, and this is what I wrote. I'm going to read you the intro I wrote:

*GURPS Survivors: The Vault. A subterranean fallout shelter. A deep cavern expanded and modified to house a thousand people for years after a nuclear holocaust. A small town of homes, businesses, and government offices, all located hundreds of feet inside the heart of a granite mountain. Engineers and architects had planned for everything the inhabitants would need to continue their lives underground. Inexhaustible power came from a large geothermal heat exchanger sunk deep into the mountain. A great cistern was filled with water, and a recycling plant was built to keep it filled indefinitely. An atmospheric plant scrubbed the internal air and returned it refreshed to the caverns. Store rooms held crates of radiated food packets for the survivors to consume after the world itself had become irradiated. And the door, a ponderous steel airlock which protected the Vault, was set into its reinforced concrete frame to keep the outside world away.*

*But on the day of the event, less than 100 people made it inside the Vault. No one heeded the emergency broadcast, the police loudspeakers, the air sirens. These things had happened before, all around the country, and every time the outcome had been the same: a false alarm, a night spent in a cold, dank shelter with hundreds of others, waiting for the announcement that the emergency was over, and it was safe to leave. So, most people stayed at home. And so, most people died when the bombs fell.*

*Nobody is really sure what happened. "The Event," as it came to be known, began and was over so quickly. A hostile nation had declared global war, and the military was on full alert. The hundred who came to the Vault sat in the entrance cavern, just inside the door, and waited for the announcement to return home. Then the door closed, automatically. For several hours, a great rhythmic pounding was heard. Those people who had made it inside the Vault tried to learn what was going on outside, but the radios and televisions inside produced only static, and the radiation monitors mounted outside continued to show a rise on the internal monitor. Gradually, the people realized that they were going to be inside the Vault for a long time. They gathered up what meager belongings they had brought with them and moved into the housing areas designed by now-dead architects. They ate the food, drank the water, and breathed the air. Slowly, they adjusted to their new life in the vault.*

*Over the years, the radiation levels had dropped to safer levels, and several volunteers had gone outside through the door. Their objective was simple: Scout the area and return. Each volunteer had learned survival skills for a variety of situations, and each one had left armed. None had ever returned. Now, over 80 years after the event, food supplies are running dangerously low. Rationing has begun, but someone needs to go outside to see if there is even food out there, to see if there are people, to see what happened. Straws are drawn, and you draw the short one.*

So, right there, you can already see that's the seed of Fallout. That's a lot of the ideas packed in there already. I love this. Now, this was intended to be a leaping-off point, and you can see we already—I mean, there's things in there about the Vault holding a thousand people and about people had left beforehand, but which all made it into the game. But there's also things like there's implication that it's the only Vault because it's called "The Vault." There's also, it's mentioned that you have to go outside because you're out of food, and that eventually became JT's idea about no, the water processing has stopped.

I had written at the end of this because I do this on everything I write, here are what I thought the advantages and disadvantages were of my own story. So, people think I can be critical of other stuff, people's stuff. I do this on everything I wrote. So, here's what I thought were the advantages and disadvantages of this story. I had listed four advantages:

1. **The player and the character both have no idea of what's outside.** I loved that because, you know, I mentioned I don't like amnesia. I think it's important sometimes for the player to understand that even the character he's made shouldn't know these things. Sometimes I play games, especially RPGs, where my players should know who these factions are, should know who these people are. I mean, didn't they grow up in this city? But they're treated like, oh no, all this has to be explained to you because it does because the player doesn't know. So, I liked that the player and the character leaving the Vault both know nothing about what's outside.

2. **It's a good explanation for why the character is alone.** You may wonder, why didn't they send out a group of five people or 10 people? One, no one wanted to go outside because people had left

 before. It was seen as a death sentence. I mean, the fact that nobody wanted to go out was why they had to draw straws. You weren't selected because you were considered the best or brightest, which worked great later when we wanted to make dumb dialogue characters. You were selected completely at random and literally ordered out. And yeah, you were given a gun, but it probably wasn't even the best gun they had because those went out with the people first. So, you were going out alone and ill-equipped, and everybody who ever went out before you never came back. I love that.

3. **It gave adequate time for groups like Junktown to have formed.** We'd already decided we wanted things like Junktown. Junktown had already been highly designed before I wrote this because it had been 80 years. What, that's three or four generations? More than enough time for Junktown to exist.

4. **It gave a purpose for the player.** Yeah, we used to call that a McGuffin because it—it doesn't really matter, but this one kind of did. I mean, you had to get the water chip, or people would die. And also, it gave you like a focus. You weren't just wandering around randomly. You had something out there you had to do, and it was important. So, I think that element of making the player feel both directed and important while not being special was perfect in this story.

The two disadvantages I wrote down was one, it had a time limit because they were going to run out of food. Even back then, I didn't like time limits. I mean, this is what, January of '95? I like—I just wrote something, and it has a time limit inherent in it, and I don't like that. The second reason I didn't like was interesting. I wrote down, I don't like that there's a home base for the player to run back to. It's kind of hard to get myself in the mindset of me back then, but I think the reason I didn't like this is I liked the idea of a player wandering the wasteland alone and with no safety net. Having that Vault, something that you could get back into, felt too much like a safety net, like there was some place you could run back to that nothing could get into that had food and water for you, where you could rest and heal, where you could ask people questions. So, I was worried that not only did it provide too much of a sense of safety in a game that I wanted the player to feel scared and alone in, but that also meant the narrative designers were going to have to support writing dialogue for all these people back in the vault. So, I saw those as disadvantages.

I also wrote, here are two alternatives to this story. I wasn't like, gripped by this story, so I wrote one of them. This is January of '95. I wrote, maybe the player awakes from cryogenic suspension. Maybe that would be a good story. And the other alternative was, maybe the player is the last survivor from a group of people killed by mutants. So, the game starts, I imagine the cinematic of you eking out an existence, maybe in a cave, maybe in a ramshackle house, with a few other people. Mutants show up, kill everybody but you, but then you manage to fight off the mutants. Either they die, or they run off. What I liked about this one was it explained why you were alone, explained why you didn't have a safe place to go back to—obviously, mutants could find it—and it also introduced the big baddies right at the beginning. It's like, yikes, these guys are scary.

Obviously, we didn't do this, and in fact, part of me loves how much of this survived into what became Fallout. But what I really love is A) that I keep everything, B) that I wrote something like this, and we used a lot of it. I mean, I told you after Temple, I thought, okay, I'm a bad writer. I should never write again. I wrote this. I like this. I also love that it mentions GURPS because we were totally bought into being GURPS at that point. And I think it's a neat intro. What I love is, and this is why I loved working with the team I did, the people on the team took this and made it a whole lot better. I think the water chip idea makes it a whole lot better. I think the idea of making a bunch of different vaults was a lot better. I think the way the dialogues worked, both in and out of the Vault, were good. Basically, this was the germ of an idea that other people grew into something fantastic. Anyway, I thought you would like hearing it, and I thought you would like a window into the very beginning of the creation of Fallout. So, I hope you like that.

Fallout Was A B-Tier Project.md

https://youtu.be/6i8Bx4zYIKQ?si=XPaqZtPeVpzCNMMC

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim. I've gotten a lot of questions about Fallout 2, and also especially why I left Fallout 2 in mid-development. I think I'm ready to talk about that, but I'll do that tomorrow because to understand my answer requires understanding a particular context about Fallout, the first one. The base game, some people call it Fallout one. I just, I can't call it Fallout one, it's Fallout.

And what I want to talk about today is Fallout was a B-tier project at Interplay. I don't know why some people from Interplay deny this. It's not, we're not embarrassed. I'm not embarrassed of it myself, and the team, we liked being a B-tier project. We liked the fact that we're off in the corner for years with very little adult supervision. I'm convinced that Fallout would not have shipped, or would definitely not have shipped the way it was, had it been more of a, um, what should I call it, a regularly made, planned, and processed game at Interplay.

The whole thing with Fallout began, and I've talked about this in other places where Fallout was created because I was playing with engines, and then I bought some pizza and invited people to come talk about settings after hours. I mean, all this was great. It turned out to be great in the long run because not as many people came to that meeting, but the people who did were really passionate about wanting to make a new game. And I think everybody who ended up coming to those meetings ended up on the final team, and we had a great team.

So, I'm not saying B-tier in necessarily a negative sense. I'm just saying there were a lot of other projects at Interplay that were better funded, had bigger teams, and were prioritized in the internal pipelines above Fallout. So, and also, I'll point out that all this changed a few months before Fallout shipped. And two things changed it before Fallout shipped, about six months. People in QA started requesting, started coming in evenings and weekends on their own time for free to play Fallout. Some of those QA people were turning down paid overtime on other projects, which then got me in trouble. I got called into the executive producer's office saying, "Hey, we can't get people to do overtime because they're playing Fallout on their own. Are you encouraging this?" And I had to tell them I'm not encouraging this, but I am encouraged by it. It means I think we're onto something here.

Also, Brian Fargo took home a copy of Fallout, I'd say late spring of '97, and it shipped in October, late September, early October that year. And he called me that weekend, "Hey, I'm stuck here. Hey, how do you do this? Is there a way? How many ways past this quest are there?" And he was really excited about it. And when he came back, he was telling people about playing it. Then, and only then, did I start getting people outside the team really interested in what we were doing.

But let me walk through why I think, and I'm going to say can prove, that Fallout was a B-tier project at Interplay. First of all, let's talk about the team. I already talked about how we got it together, but the team on Fallout was made up of three kinds of people, and some people were in more than one of these groups. There were a lot of people who were relatively new and inexperienced. Fallout was either their first project or their first project in the role they were in. It was the first project I was in charge of. It was my fourth game in the industry. I had made Grandstand, Bridge, Bardstown Construction Set, and Rags to Riches before Fallout, but all of those, I was doing programming and some design. This is the first time I was the project leader. I was the producer. A lot of people on Fallout, this was their first time role. A lot of them, it was their first game. It was Jason Anderson's. I mean, he was hired directly into do Fallout, although I think he ended up doing some Stonekeep work as well.

So, we had a lot of new and inexperienced people. We also had people that I called quiet powerhouses. These were people who were not universally recognized as being really awesome at what they did, and I noticed there were several people like this at Interplay that were just always quiet, their nose to the grindstone, their pen to paper. They were just working all the time, and they did great work, but they never promoted themselves. They weren't the ones to speak up in meetings, so they weren't seen as the go-getters or whatever, but they were the people I wanted. I wanted people who would really want to work hard and make this game good.

And then the third group, which is funny because I'm not going to name names, but there are a number of people assigned to my project because they were considered problem employees on other projects. And let me tell you, with one exception, which I dealt with early and so really didn't have much to do with the project and got rid of that employee, the other ones were great. I didn't see what the problems were, to the point where I actually went to a couple producers to say, "What was the problem with this person?" And I came to realize that the problem was the managers. They were the problem. They, some of them, tried to handle every employee as the same employee. They had this one method of dealing with employees, and if the employee didn't like it, they were a problem. And I learned that there were people on my team that would get upset if I didn't come by and check with them every day. They'd get upset. And then there were other people who, once I assigned them a task, would get upset if I checked in on them. If they said it took three days, they didn't want to see me for three days. So, I learned that, and that's how I managed.

Now, it was interesting because, at one point, about a year and a half into making Fallout, I was invited to speak at the monthly producer meeting, which I usually skipped. I was just, I was too busy. Because other teams had noticed that our team was very motivated and full passion and just loved what they were doing and like stay late and would work on things and we're always talking about what they were working on when they'd go to lunch with other people. And they wanted to know how I did that. And I was like, "I'm not sure I understand," but I wrote down what I thought were obvious things to do as a project leader, and I talked to them. In fact, I can do a video on that because I found my talk. I found my notes. Um, I could do a whole talk on how to motivate a team Circa 1995. Maybe '96.

So, anyway, so that was B-tier. One was our team was not the team ever other people would have picked, including me. Second one was, I was told repeatedly throughout almost the entire time I was making Fallout that, and even by people above me, that they couldn't wait for Fallout to ship so they could put me on something worthwhile. And that was because they didn't think

, when we were GURPS, GURPS was a very small, narrow, uh, what do they call it, it was a um, very narrow focus compared to like D&D, and that's what they wanted me on. Several people were like, "Oh, we're going to put you on D&D as soon as, um, Fallout ships."

In fact, Fallout almost got canceled when we got, when Interplay got the D&D license because they figured, "Why make this RPG that isn't D&D if we have the D&D license?" which some people call the license to print money. I had to convince, I, and I did it directly to Fargo, not to cancel it. I said, "Look, this is a post-apocalyptic. It's not going to interfere with fantasy D&D games. RPG players buy a lot of, uh, RPGs all the time." I didn't know if that was true, but I said it. I did it. Um, and actually, to be honest, I can, that's, these are other videos too. That wasn't the only time Fallout was almost canceled. There were three. Many people on the team know about two. They don't know about the third one. But, um, so that wasn't the only time we almost canceled. But I mean, if we were an A-tier project, I don't think there would have been multiple cancellation attempts.

The other thing was, when I looked at the other D&D games being made, like Descent to Undermountain, I was concerned. I, I saw some off design choices being made. I saw team members that fought with each other. I mean, yeah, on Fallout we discussed things, but these people actually fought. It was weird. They were not making the same game. They were at cross purposes. So, that was, that was a strange thing to aspire to be on a team like that.

So, that was the second thing. So, we had team members, and then our, our, I was told, "Hey, just finish this up so we can put you and every, all these people on something good." The other thing was, we, I didn't meet with a lot of people, um, until those last few months, which is unusual. I didn't hear from marketing. Um, no one ever asked me to do interviews. We didn't have press coming by. If this was an A-tier game, that would have happened. Instead, what happened was, after Fargo played it and loved it, suddenly marketing's like, "Hey, what kind of ads you want? We should get together. We should talk." And I'm like, "We ship in a few months." I only remember one ad coming out for Fallout. I've been told there were two. Okay, so I'm off by a factor of double. But there weren't many. There weren't many reviews or previews, I should say. Basically, there wasn't a lot of knowledge. And I hear a lot of stories about people wandering into a game store and seeing the box and flipping it open because we had that neat hinged lid, and and that's how they learned about Fallout. Again, I don't think that would have happened if we were an A-list game.

But probably the most important thing is, there was absolutely no sequel plan for Fallout. It was always a one-off game. There was no discussion. There was no, we didn't put things in the game to, to make it easy to leverage a sequel. We didn't even think about a sequel until after those two events happened. QA started playing it all the time, and Fargo took it home to play and liked it. Suddenly, people wanted to talk about a sequel, and I was way too busy. I mean, we were working. We had already been working 12 and 14-hour days. I didn't have enough time to think about a sequel. So, what we did was, I said, "Look, maybe I want to do something else after this because I'm not a big sequel person, and after three and a half years, I think I might want to work on something else." So, they spun up another team to do it. Fergus picked the designer, and I wanted my assistant producer, Fred, to be the producer on it. In fact, and this is a little side story, but I'm going to say it. I house sat for someone else on the team over the July 4th weekend in '97, and I did the team's reviews because they were, we did the mid-year, and I did Fred's review, filled out all the paperwork. The last line on it was, "Recommended promotion to producer on Fallout 2." And I turned all that in. Now, keep in mind, I left. He didn't get processed, and I left shortly into '98. I found out years later that Fred was told I never turned in the paperwork. So, Fred, if you're listening, I turned in that paperwork and recommended your promotion to be the producer on Fallout 2. Sorry, it didn't happen, and if anybody told you I didn't do it, that's not true.

But anyway, so there was a whole second team working on it, and we were trying to get the first game out. What happened was, um, the game shipped. Fallout shipped. It got good reviews. It didn't necessarily get great sales, but it had really good reviews, and some of them were like, "It's revitalizing the RPG genre," and we were all, "That's really awesome." I started working on something else. Oddly, I, it's the one thing I can't find my notes for. I don't know what I was working on, but I was working on something else. And that's when, not Fergus, but Brian Fargo ordered me back on Fallout 2.

So, I'll talk about that tomorrow. But I just wanted to get all this down so you understand kind of the context of Fallout being B-tier and what it was like, kind of at the end. There was another team working on Fallout 2. I was exhausted. I was ready to do something else. For most of this creation, I was told it wasn't worthwhile, and suddenly at the end, it was worthwhile. So, it's weird to believe in something all the time that other people only believe right at the end. But that is also something that seems to happen in the game industry. People are reticent to jump on something unless they think it's a sure thing. No one wants to jump on a game that bombs. Like, I still love Temple of Elemental Evil. I don't hear a lot of people who worked on it saying that was their favorite game or whatever. I loved it. But we, after Fallout shipped, suddenly it was everybody's favorite game ever, including some people I had never really seen before.

So, anyway, that's kind of the context of understanding what making Fallout was like, and tomorrow I'll talk about Fallout 2.

Fallout What I'd Change Today.md
Youtube Link:
https://youtu.be/lexhF4xqpu8?si=r0Hfl510-vrQZeJB

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim. Today I want to talk about what changes I would make to Fallout if I were to tinker with it today. I want to make this clear, I wouldn't make big changes. I'm not talking about let's remake Fallout as a 3D real-time action game, no. I'm talking about if not a remaster, but just if I was gonna go back and go, "God, if I just had a little more time, it wouldn't have shipped like this." So, what would I have gone through and done? I have a lot of notes on this, by the way. I have notes I took as soon as probably a few weeks after Fallout shipped, a lot of notes. I sat down about 10 or 15 years ago and wrote up a bunch of notes. I've also noticed people have asked for things online for years and I'm like, "Oh yeah, that we should have done that." So I've compiled this, um, and I put it in sections for ease of listening.

So let's start with the user interface. There are a lot of things we could have done better with the user interface. Some of these are like we've learned over time what user interface types, in fact, UI is now called UX because the whole thing's an experience. It's not just what you interact with, it's things you see and hear. So I want to talk about what I would do to just not wildly change the user interface but just make it a lot more user-friendly. So on the main user interface, the big things I'd probably change would be when you have an item in the active slot that it makes sense what it does. The biggest example of that is if you have explosives in there, you should just be able to click on it and the explosive drops and the timer starts. So you can drop dynamite, you could, you know, drop any kind of explosive you want. If it's a grenade, you throw it. That also would be things like rope. If you put the rope in there, then you click on the rope, you get a cursor and you click on what you want to do with it. None of this right-click use from inventory. Maybe that could still be there, but I'd want to change that.

Now speaking of inventory, there's a bunch of changes I would make to the inventory screen. First of all, a take-all button. I can't believe we just didn't put a take-all button in. Just, ah. The second thing I would do almost instantaneously is add many more digits to the move UI, that sub-UI when you pick up a stack of something says how much of these do you want to move. Right now, it's capped at three digits. I don't think we thought 999 was going to be enough. No, especially with caps, you want to be able to move a five-digit minimum. I'd probably make it six or seven or just widen that thing out. It's not a problem to add more digits, just we should have done that. I'd also let you use the page up and down keys to go up and down in inventory, maybe even add above the up and down arrow a page up and page down button. Also, when you pick up items, I'd put them at the beginning of that inventory list, not the end, because when you pick something up, that's probably what you want to go look at. Finally, I would display your carry weight right there in the inventory screen. It's weird that you had to go over to your character page to see that. You should be able to see how close you're getting to your carry weight.

For the dialogue screens, I would have displayed when you're talking to somebody, I would have put money in there so you can see how much money you have, especially when you're because if you get offered to bribe somebody or pay somebody something, you kind of want to see how much am I dipping into my funds. While I'm on that, I'd say I definitely want more heads, to more those Talking Heads. I mentioned in a video it took us three or four months per head, so we put as many in as we could. I wish we either could have sped up that process or added more people into that pipeline so we could have put more Talking Heads in. They were cool. The downside of that is, you know, they're audio, their scripts had to be figured out early because the voiceover was recorded for those heads, the phonemes were matched to that dialogue, that all had to be done early. So the more of those we had, it would have required locking down some dialogues early.

On the world map, a couple of things I'd do there. Whenever you had an encounter, it threw away where you were going. So if you were leaving the Vault for the first time and you clicked on Vault 15 and you started going over there, and you saw Shady Sands or you had a random encounter, it forgot where you were going. That should have just stayed in there until the player picked something else actively. Also, I would have made perks and skills let you avoid some Random Encounters. The Outdoorsman skill should have done that, or there should have been a perk for that. You should have been able to decide, "I just don't feel like having this encounter right now." Maybe it isn't guaranteed, maybe it's skipping low-level ones or high-level ones, but I would put something in for that.

The next thing was companion AI. If you watched my video on making Fallout, you understand that companions were added very, very, very late to the game, and there was really no chance to do an AI overhaul. I would have done that. First of all, I would let you barter with your party members. You don't have to pickpocket them or whatever it is now to let you change their armor and weapons. I would also let you tell party members to move out of the way. We actually did that for NPCs in Fallout 2. It's one of the last things I put in before I left. I wish that had been in the base game, and I wish it had been in for your party members because they kind of tend to stand in your way. I would have let party members change their armor. A lot of times, we didn't put that in because we didn't have, we didn't want to change the model. We wanted them to look a certain way. No, once they become your companion, let you customize them, whatever you want. I would also let them gain levels so they stay, keep up with you in terms of skills and hit points and all of that, and maybe get some perks of their own, either from the player's list or maybe they have their own list. I would also put in combat settings specifically for the party members so you could say, you know, "I want you to be defensive. I want you to be aggressive," those kinds of things, which are really common now. We just didn't think of them back then. I also basically, whenever you started actively using a healing skill or any skill that you were targeting them with, like even if you were stealing because you wanted to, you know, trade out into them, turn off their move. They had an idol where they'd move around.

 Sometimes they'd step from one position to another. It was so frustrating trying to click on them while they were moving around.

For combat and options related to it, I definitely would have put in more turn-based options. I've talked about this in another video where I said, hey, put all the enemies on the same turn and have them go at the same time. That would have really helped just to make turn-based a little snappier, especially when you go into turn base in a big town, and most people are just moving away from you. It's just, it really slowed down Fallout in a way it didn't need to be slowed down. I would have made skills more useful and even considered collapsing some. And what I mean there is you could take energy weapons, but we didn't even drop anything for at least the first third, if not the first half of the game. So I would have put in some energy weapons earlier in the game, just so you could use that skill. Otherwise, why did you tag it? I would have also collapsed some. There's been a lot of discussion about maybe first aid and doctor just collapse that into one skill. But in general, I would have done a pass over skills and gone, "Are all these equally useful?" Maybe some of them needed some more functionality, maybe a couple of them needed to be collapsed, or maybe the thing that they operated on, the thing that you did with it, needed to be spread out and used more frequently throughout the game, at early levels and later levels. Similar to that, it was on a balance pass on the traits. I understand everyone's always like, "Take gifted, it's what you should take." Yeah, I agree, it's some of them are more powerful than others. We really do a balance pass on that. Wouldn't change it too much, though, because there's something fun about what was there, but anyway.

And then I would go through the combat options. For example, I would say that ranged attacks that miss won't have any chance to strike other creatures unless you're playing with combat set to rough. Similarly, I would say that spray attacks like from Uzis don't have any chance to strike friendly creatures nearby, friendly to the person shooting, unless combat is set to rough. And then, conversely, I would say no critical failures happen if the game difficulty is set to easy. I know a lot of people have told stories about how they started the game and critically, even though I turned off critical failures for the first day, once they left the rat cave, they were immediately set upon in a random encounter and they critically failed in that. I would say on easy, no critical failures for both sides. There's also a bug the game shipped with where stat rolls could only be success or failure, they could not be critical success or failure. I'd fix that, which would, by the way, fix scripts like playing chess with Zax, the supercomputer. Apparently, there was a script outcome there that could never happen because the scripter wrote it assuming you could get a critical success, and there was a bug in critical success rolls against stats. Finally, I would let the game play in way higher resolutions than 640x480. Definitely for playing the game, definitely for expanding the cinematics. Not sure if I could put Uprising in there, I'm not sure that would be appropriate, but definitely a simple scalar for the art, and also once I did that, then I'd make the in-game windows either center themselves or push off to a corner very easily, and you'd have options to do that.

I think that's most of the changes I'd make. I know people are probably thinking, "Oh, I can think of a 10 other things you should do," and you're probably right, but some of the things I've seen people suggest, it changes Fallout, it changes kind of the nature of what Fallout is, and I wanted to be, have a very light hand on making these changes. I don't want Fallout to be a different game. I just think it could be a little easier, especially for modern gamers to get into. Anyway, hope you like that.
Title:
Fallout's Voice Overs.md
Youtube Link:
https://youtu.be/UkXOppoyJaM?si=eXqwXWp4ia8pOPxm

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim. Today I want to talk about Fallouts voice overs. Now what made me think of this was yesterday I had to do I had to take part in some voice over sessions for another project I'm involved in, and I happen to mention to someone there and it was this was done in Stockholm so I ended up getting up like four in the morning so I could get on a zoom link to the rehearsal, and I mentioned to some of the people there that I had not done this since Fallout 26 years ago, 27 years ago and so this was kind of you know not new to me but still somewhat novel. 

The whole thing with voice over in in games is it tends to be done you try to do it as late as possible so all the scripts are written, everything's ready to go you the game is as stable as possible so you know things aren't going to change but you can't do it too late in the process because you have to get the cast in a studio you have to have them do their lines you have to pick the lines you want you have to have them cut, you have to have them put into the games database you have to associate them the correct lines and then they have to be tested, so this has been unearly enough to get all that done. So you try to put off doing voice over until late in the process but early enough to get that stuff done.

If you remember what I mentioned in an earlier video at one point we discovered late in fallout's process just a few months before we shipped that whole areas hadn't been designed. Well we discovered that after after we did the voiceover, the voiceover I think started in late 96 and we did in early 97. So this is why the voiceovers sometimes don't match that's why air Dash mentions a Viper gang that we never had time to put in it's by the guard out in front of the Brotherhood of Steel tells you to go in One Direction and then his unvoiced assistant next to him pipes in oh no we got new Intel we really go you have to go in another Direction because literally something changed after we had that recorded by the way just recording that guard is a story in himself that I'll get to.

So this is a lot of work to do this and Charles Dean and our Awesome Audio director found us an awesome awesome voice director Jamie Thomason. I met him a couple times, it was he knew everybody he was super good at what he did and I actually went and watched once and I can confirm that he was just really really good. We were really lucky to have gotten him but when we started doing the voice over my plate I was already coming in every day seven days a week 10 to 12 hours a day and as you know from a few previous videos about the time of early January is when we lost the girk's license so we had to make a whole new system and program it and that was when Jason Anderson and Jess Hennig decided they were going to script companions into the game and oh we needed a lot of new code support for that so my already overflowing plate was now just jammed it was just it was there was literally a single second free this is where Fred hatch stepped up my associate producer Fred handled all of this stuff.

He was the one who coordinated with Jamie got him all the scripts sometimes literally took a script up to Jamie the morning of the night before remember I talked about I wrote a what Ron Perlman said to the open narration the whole war war never changes because we didn't really like what had been written so I rewrote one and there was no time for anyone to look at it there was no time for editing basically wrote it that night Fred took it up the next morning and that's what Ron Perlman said he said that one and the other one and we we chose mine and that's what shipped so that's how like down to the wire we were you know and Fred did all this Fred basically took over handling voice production um we gave him a credit for that in addition to production assistant just because he handled a lot of stuff that normally the producer would handle and as the producer and lead programmer and designer I just I just couldn't do it it was uh it was crazy now thinking of all the hats that all of us wore everybody was super busy all the time but people just stepped up when stuff had to be done.

So Jamie um had found all of these amazing voice actors I even went back to the credits I mean we had David Warner and Cree Summer and Tony Shalhoub you know he was did Galaxy Quest just a couple years later um CCH Pounder who's on X-Files Ron Perlman which we've talked about Richard mauld from Night Court that's the story I'm going to tell you about too Tres McNeil Tony J Brad Garrett Keith David who I knew from um they live you know he's a guy who had the long fight scene with Rowdy Roddy Piper in the alley but now I know him as a we're a potassionate from Community I mean Clancy Brown from um Highlander Richard Dean Anderson from MacGyver I mean there these were famous people coming in to read lines for our game and it was all because Jamie knew so many people um they were all super nice.

Um I'll give you an example of how cool they were at one point Fred called me from they did this up in Hollywood part of the reason these actors would do it was it was four hours in a Hollywood studio that was probably 10 or 15 minutes from where they lived so they could drive in they knew Jamie they got their script they read it four hours later they were gone they got paid sag rates easy job no no rehearsal no makeup they just drove in said their lines left. Fred called me in a panic one day because the person who was supposed to do the guard outside of um the Brotherhood Steele it was a well-known actor on a well-known TV series with a very very specific voice and voice pattern I'm not going to say who it is but apparently that's all I could do so this guard sounded just like a well-known TV character which wasn't what we wanted him to sound like and what we certainly didn't want him associated with so Fred caught me in a panic he's like I don't think this is going to work so somehow we found in the budget we could hire someone but who well Jamie knew Richard mull the guy who played Bull from Nightcore caught him up and said can you literally come down he had no idea what this was he just knew Jamie and he's like sure I'll come down four hours you know boom came in red that character was awesome awesome and that's only why it happened and they were all really nice Fred called me one day and said hey normally he'd come back around four and he goes hey um I think it was Ron Perlman he just offered me some tickets to a Dodgers game do you mind if I go to that instead of coming back to work and I'm like no as long as you get the the uh audio tape into the audio department by tomorrow morning and I don't care what you do when he's throwing off to see a game that was very cool in fact I was a little jealous because Fred would come back and he'd tell me how much fun he had up there even though it's a lot of work it was it was a fun Studio so I wanted to go and see because I had never I I've never done any job but making computer games other than briefly teaching

 computer science as a grad student at UCI so I wanted to go up and see what this was like I was always curious what other industries were like so one day I was going up and I think the letter to Jason went with me we went up and I wanted to watch David Warner do his lines David Warner was the photographer in The Omen he was he was an ultimate Evil in Time Bandits awesome actor awesome voice actor and he did Morpheus in Fallout and I wanted to watch him do it so we went up there we introduced ourselves to him where Jamie introduced us and um he'd said he had just started doing voice acting he had done one game before this he would go on to do many more but he was hoping to get into a variety of characters because he said well I always do evil we all got quiet and we're looking at each other and I was like um the character you're doing today is evil and he said and we had uh I think Leonard had brought a picture of Morpheus because he was a talking head and we had finished the clay head and so he had a picture of him he went uh he went in and he did an awesome evil Morpheus I mean if you played the game you've heard him I just remember there was one scene that I thought was great I was like this is amazing he got it First Take and Jamie after he's done said David I love that that was great but I was hoping you could really lean into it like Morpheus is dropping the mask now it's No More Mr Nice Guy he's not pretending he's not evil I just want to feel that and everyone went okay you know I'm thinking he just told David Warner what to do but David was like okay I can do that second take absolutely amazing and I I still remember saying this it was like evil was dripping down the Walls it was so rich and emotive and toning evil you were like oh and it cut he Jamie says cut that was great and everyone's like you know he's a nice guy and then the perfect part of it was so he ends doing that and the door opens and in comes one of the voice Studio employees with a tray of fresh baked chocolate chip cookies which they bake they had an oven there they baked these and just brought them around different Studios so we all said pink chocolate chip cookies listening to the replay of all these evil lives um it was just it was awesome remember I remember thinking this is perfect this is why you know this is what you do in an environment to make people comfortable and happy and willing to do it it was just it was a fun time.

Needless to say you know Fred handled getting all the rest of those guys and more I listed those people that's just a fraction of people we had got them all done got them in yes we then had to redesign some games so things don't quite match and we fixed that by having non-voiced characters make up for it and and um sometimes just having people mention things that just you you never found this Viper gang but they're out there in later games games put them in this is just what I love about it and I wanted to explain all this to you so you guys could hear first of all what something like that is how it's done professionally but also just like this was how video games in Hollywood first started meeting up it didn't it got much tighter later this you know because movies started using CG and actors floated more readily between games and movies and TV shows it's just the barriers started falling down I'll probably have to do it another video but this is also what AI is going to change because you can do voices more readily which means you can since the voices can be done by an AI I think in real time you can wait until the last minute after everything is done to insert voice but I'm not 100 sure that AI will ever be able to replace that because watching these actors do this work they would sometimes put something in to the role into the voice that you didn't even know you wanted like I said I thought David Warner's First Take on Morpheus was great but Jamie got the second take on some of the lines out of David Warner that was beyond my expectation so I am worried that AI May give us a lot of those good first takes I don't know if they can become great they will solve the problem of getting stuff in at the last minute but I think we'll lose something and that might be true for all the AI that might be true for art um for programming which here AI is coming for so we'll see where that goes but all I can tell you is what I see with voice actors is amazing and what I saw yesterday at 4am why I drank coffee and paid attention to what was going on in Stockholm from you know my little house in Seattle it was amazing watching these young actors just pull these amazing emotive voices and expressions and intonations out and I thought this is this is where the magic happens and I was glad at some point at the start and end of my career I got to be part of that I got to watch people who are masters of a completely different craft show me a little glimpse into what they do and I hope that gave you a glimpse into it as well.

Fast Fail.md

https://youtu.be/3kyFVaHPPU8?si=ul1eEw8ACq5-TZ-J

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim, and today I want to talk about a development methodology called Fast fail. Ironically, I used to do fast fail 30 years ago before I knew what it was called, and I'm doing it now with my own little fun in-house games, but it hasn't been something done recently, and I want to talk about it cuz I really think fast fail is a good way of making games and maybe if you're thinking about making your prototype, this may help you put it together.

So what's called Fast fail these days is something that I used to just call rapid prototyping, and if you watch the video I have on stages that um game development goes through, prototyping is one of the early stages where you quickly put together a level just to see if a mechanic works or just to see if the level size is good or the sight lines are good or whatever you're trying to do. You do it before you have final art and final code. To do rapid prototyping, you have to be in the mindset that you view failure as a good thing, that you're not upset when something fails. You're happy that with as little time and resource investment as possible, you discovered something you were about to do isn't going to work. That's what I love about rapid prototyping and this fast fail methodology, but it means if you do this, you have to be willing to throw away stuff. If you're a designer, you have to let go of a design mechanic that you think is great. If you're a programmer, you have to be willing to throw away code. If you're an artist, you have to throw away your art. That's part of fast fail. You do something, it doesn't work, you do something else.

And there are some people who just can't do that. I used to think it was an ego thing, now I'm beginning to think that some people don't understand that the path to a destination isn't straight, that when you're trying to get to an endpoint, you won't always walk directly there. Sometimes there are some things you need to go around, sometimes you end up on what we used to call in AI uh local local Maxima, you know, which it's why hill climbing algorithms get stuck because you're trying to find a mountain but you're stuck at the top of a local hill and every every step you take is down, but you know you're not at the mountain top yet. This is kind of what rapid prototyping lets you do with design ideas, code ideas, art ideas. You can put them together really quickly, see if it's going to work.

Now, I mentioned I'm doing that now with the little games I make for fun, that little uh space combat simulator, my 3D dungeon maker, those are just I had an idea I wanted to see if it worked. If it hadn't, no big loss; if they did, great, I have a thing that now sitting in my you know project folder that contains a feasible idea. Win-win.

If you watched my early videos on making Fallout, you're know that rapid prototyping was something I did very, very early on. There was there were three engines made before we picked the isometric one, there was a voxel engine and a 3D engine, and they were dumped because the voxel one was too limited and the 3D engine one was too slow and too low poly for the frame rates I wanted to get. It would have been a very low poly game, it just, it, we wouldn't have been able to use those engines to make the Fallout that we wanted to make. But if I hadn't made them, we wouldn't have known that.

We were very, I don't know if it's called agile now, but we were very open to ideas, even if they changed everything. When Leonard had his idea for changing the Aesthetics of Fallout to what the 50s thought the future would be, we had already made a lot of stuff, some of it got thrown out. We threw out some wall sets, trying to remember, there was a few things we throughout, we kept a lot of things though. That's why when you play Fallout, you see some armor, and you're like, that looks like it's out of Road Warrior, not a 50s movie, and you're right. There was stuff we liked from other places that we kept, even though they weren't completely in line with the new aesthetic. They didn't, they weren't jarring, and they made sense, that you know, everyone's not going to run around in leather jackets.

Probably the biggest thing that happened, you know, is when we decided we weren't going to go with GURPS anymore, and we had to make a new system mechanics. We had to move fast, and we had to test quickly, and that happened. I mean, Chris came back to me in a few days with a nearly fully realized system, and we threw it in, and we hooked it up, and we played it, and that's when I, I remember I said I wanted to put luck in, and Brian Fargo was like, hey, I think we need to buy something there, need to be something that's purchasable besides skills, and we did that. But that was because the game itself, we treated as a prototype, and we threw the new mechanics in and saw how they worked. I sometimes look back at Fallout and went, hey, I didn't realize that that's what we were doing back then, but we really did the rapid prototyping at the beginning and the end of that game, and a little bit in the middle.

Sometimes I think about Arcanum, and I'm like, I think the problem with Arcanum was we prototyped a lot of stuff, and then we didn't have time to remove it, so you're playing a lot of systems in that game that are in their raw Alpha State, and that's actually one of the problem problems with fast fail. So this go fast to find great methodology doesn't work in some situations, and a lot of companies don't do it at all because they've seen failure. This is how it can fail. A lot of bosses and Publishers can't see the ideas being expressed in a prototype because they can't see past the gray boxing. I've worked with people who look at a graybox prototype and go, this is stupid, you know, my favorite unconstructive feedback I've ever gotten. But I've tried to explain to them, we're not here to look at Art, we're not here to look at you know anything but a prototype for a stealth mechanic. So yeah, we have toost guards sliding around, and all the buildings are big gray Cubes, but that's not what we're here to look at, we're here to see if the stealth mechanic makes sense, if it makes sense there's the guard going around the building on a path, and you're trying to sneak into the building, and the door is just a hole in the side, and there's a vent which is a smaller hole that you have to crouch to get into, and that's what we're testing. We're testing sight lines and feedback and does it make sense, does it make sense to the player who's sneaking through this, is everything behaving like they would expect. But I've worked

 with people who just look at it and go, this looks dumb, this is horrible, this mechanic is awful, and the mechanic isn't awful, they just can't see past the gray boxing. By the way, if you work with people like this, you simply cannot show them prototypes, and I don't know all way around it. I've worked with too many people who literally cannot see past the gray box, they even if they tell you they will, all their feedback comes back negative.

So I don't know how to do that other than wait till you have a beautiful corner or a vertical slice and show them that. Also, I've worked with developers who can't do fast fail either because they can't bear it apart with their work. Once they've coded something, once they've written a design dock for a system mechanic, once they've put together a creature or a prop that goes in the world, they really, really want it to go in the world, and they, they, they can't bear to part with it. I think I mentioned in South Park we threw away whole levels, and yeah, that was, that was painful. I mean, completed, finished, playable, shippable levels, it was painful, but we did it. Some devs can't do that, they're once that happens, they're just, they can't bear it, they want to go to another project, they, they're seeing their work thrown away rather than for what it is, which is, we put something together, it doesn't work, we're moving on.

Another problem with fast fail is, with Fallout, I did a lot of it before anybody came on board, so me making engines in either my free time or my spare time when my installer maker was running, me putting together an engine didn't cost much. But once you have a full team, if you're trying to bankroll the fast fail method, you're paying a lot of people to do a lot of work that you may throw away. That's, it's every other industry in the world calls that research and development, R&D. There isn't a whole lot of R&D in the game industry, at least not in a lot of game companies. Some still do it, but those are companies that have a big enough War chest that they can bankroll it. So I used to tell people, like ID, and valve, and blizzard, they can work on a game until it's done. Most companies work on a game until the budget's finished, and then it gets shipped, so it's very hard to do fast fail, which has R&D, which is very hard to predict. You know, I defy anybody, no matter what, how good producer they are, and how many years experiened as developer they are, to predict how long an R&D phase will last until you get something acceptable. So that's another big problem with fail fast fail.

And then the one last thing that I've actually seen happen is, because you're not going in a straight direction towards your destination, there's a possibility that you will wander forever. I call this the convergence problem, it's what I saw happen at carbine, there were a lot of ideas going in for lots of different things, but nothing was converging. Now I identified that issue as, there was no vision, there was no singular Vision, too many people had too much say in what was going into the game, so it never converged on one thing, so all the prototyping and redesign in the world isn't going to help because you're not converging on any central idea, you're just wandering through a space of design ideas, and you're never ever going to arrive at one.

So that's what I see as fast fail and some of the dangers. I believe that because a lot of companies don't do fast fail now, we see a lot of stable games that aren't that good, or games that get better after their third or fourth patch, maybe even after a year or two, especially AAA games that ship and are eh, and then they get better and significantly different, you know, a year or two later. That's obviously a company that didn't fast fail in Rapid prototype. Now fast fail can lead to unstable games because you have changed things out so much, but I also believe that it is the path to Greatness. So sometimes I think companies have to decide, do they want stable goodness or little unstable greatness, and personally, I like Fast fail, but the there were whole decades in my career that I didn't have an opportunity to use it. But if this is something you're thinking about putting together a prototype, I recommend doing it as quickly as possible and making as much prototypes as many prototypes as possible just to see what works, and I think that will result in a better final game for you. Anyway, hope this helps.

Features From Ideas To Implementation.md
Youtube Link:
https://youtu.be/1gWQ8WVdZZc?si=Fu1mqLxiCeqg31JO

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim. Today, I want to answer a question from Wyatt's Vlog who asks, "Could you talk about the steps you take when exploring and implementing a feature?" Good question, also one that I held off a while on answering because it touches a lot of other videos: the three Challenge videos (challenging facing designers, challenges facing programmers, and challenges facing artists). I'll touch upon those, also the problem of doing credits. I'll touch upon that as well. So, let me tell you how I go about exploring and implementing a feature in a game.

So, I'm gonna assume the game is already roughly designed, possibly already underway, and you have an idea for a feature for it because this is very different. This is a very different process than coming up with an idea for a game altogether. For that, take a look at my video on brainstorming. So, this is just, I have an idea for a feature for a game I'm working on.

**Writing It Down**

First thing I do, and I know I've said this repeatedly, I should have brought this up earlier, is write it down. If you have an idea, doesn't matter how small, how big, how complicated, how simple, write it down. I can't tell you how many ideas I have failed to do that for, and then a few days later, a few weeks later, I'm like, "Hey, what was that idea I had?" and I don't remember. So, write it down.

At that point, if when you have an idea and you want to consider putting it in a game that you have in development, at that point, I run it by people. This is not formal. I don't call a meeting. I may not have a design document. I basically just use some people on the team, and even some people at the company, and even some people I know in the industry as sounding boards. There are some people I've worked with that are really good at bouncing early level ideas off of, and you may think, "Well, everybody's good at that." No, there are some people that if you just bring them an idea like this, they almost always say no. They go, "No, no," or they can't even wrap their head around what you're talking about. They need to see mock-ups, they need to see specifications, they need to see a similar game doing it, and I'll talk about that in a second. But like, Leonard Boyarsky's always been a good sounding board, even for non-art stuff. I mean, especially for story and setting stuff, but sometimes I bounce a system mechanic off of it because he's played a lot of games, and he's played all of our games, and he's really good at going, "Yeah, won't that cause this problem?" or "Isn't this a lot like this?" or "Didn't we try that already?" And it's just good to do that.

I also loved bouncing ideas off of Charlie Staples, who was the lead designer in Outer Worlds. Our offices are right next to each other, and I'd walk around the corner with my new idea face, and I can almost imagine he's like, "What did you just think of?" But he was really good, gave really good feedback.

The other thing I do at this stage is I look at games that have that feature or a similar feature or similar games that maybe be missing that feature, and then I look at their reviews, and not just the good reviews. This is something, I use sites like Metacritic, anything that aggregates reviews. I like to go to them and look at those games and go, "Did anybody talk about this feature?" or "Did anyone talk about this feature being missing, like they wish they had this feature?" because that game's already shipped, and you can see if they have a similar feature, you can see what if it caused any issues or people wish it was different. If it was missing a feature and people call it out as, "I wish this feature was in there," you can see if anybody points out why it wasn't added. So, anyway, I often look at other games' reviews for that reason.

**Writing A Specification**

So, that was stage two. Stage three, write a specification. Write a formal specification. Try to get everything down that's in your idea, every UI you think you'll need, what new art you think you'll need, what systems it's connected to, what features do you think it might be similar to in other games, or what other games would have benefited from such a feature, what this game does for you. Write down the goals. Remember I talked about this when you write a design document, put the goals at the top that this design, this feature is going to meet, so that way when you have subsequent meetings on this, people can talk about one of two things: either they don't think this new feature of yours meets the goals you listed, or they question those goals, but those are two totally separate discussions. Also, you should say in some way how this feature connects to your pillars. You did write design pillars, right? I got a whole video on that, right? Design pillars, that's exactly why they exist, so that when you come up with features like this, you can say, "We have to have this feature. It directly supports this pillar, which is barely supported as it is." I've gotten several features added to games that way.

So, now that you've finished stage three and you have a written spec, run that by people. In at Obsidian, we did these specs on Confluence, so that way they could be edited, and people could go and look at previous versions. But also, what you could do is when you wanted people to look at it, you would ask for reviews by, and you'd actually put their names in and put a little checkbox, and that way, you know if they've looked at it and finished the review because when they put in all their comments, and when they're done and they put their last comment, they checked that box, which means they're not going to put any more comments on this version. And then you, when those people have all checked it off, you can go in and see what they've commented. This is the time for people, especially your programmers and artists, but other designers to say things like, "I don't think this feature is going to work," or "I don't know if how long we have to do it," or "Doesn't this contradict this other feature?" or "Wow, this is going to require a lot of new art or new UI." Basically, all the stuff that's gonna be difficult about doing this, or if they don't understand something, "Hey, you didn't really explain this. How is this going to work? I don't understand this part right here." In those videos, I talked about challenges that programmers and artists and designers face. This is a major cause of those. Programs were off to be like, "Oh, they want to add a new feature." Artists are like, "Oh, we don't have time to add that art." And this is where all that comes out.

So then, you go to the next stage, where you revise that spec. You try to address everyone's

 issues. What's nice about Confluence, you can literally answer the questions they leave as inline comments. You can answer it, and then if they agree, you resolve it, and it goes away. So, you try to resolve as many of those things as possible. You write a new spec that addresses all of this. Boom, now you've got a spec for the feature that has passed all your leads and anyone else who owns that section of the game or wants to have a say in that section.

So then, you take that revised spec. Now, in the old days, that's when I'd implement it. "Hey, I have got enough information. I'm going to code it right now." These days, it gets handed off to a producer who gets estimates from all the devs, especially the ones that looked at it, and especially the leads, gets their sign-off that this is something that's going in the game, and puts it into the schedule and assigns it to people to work on. So, at this stage, if you're interested, like, "Hey, who's going to be doing my feature?" you can see it in the schedule, the project schedule. When will it be put in? That's also on the project schedule. It's an estimate, but at least you have an idea.

So then, it gets implemented, and at that stage, what happens is when those features get invented because you have a... I used to talk to my executive producer every morning. You have a, I think we had a weekly or bi-weekly meeting where we sat down and talked about production, and he would go over, "Here's everything that got put in." So, when it gets implemented, it goes off to QA. He tells the head of QA, "Here's a new feature just went in. Please start testing it." I often tested it myself. Like I mentioned, I'd come in early. I grabbed the build, and I test those things myself because, especially, I want to see how they... how they work and how they interact with other things and how close if the implementation was what was specked, was just something QA won't necessarily look for. QA will say, "Hey, there's bugs," or "It's really imbalanced," or "It works badly with this other feature," or "Has this interaction with this other feature." I look for all those two, but I also look for, is this what was asked for? I compare it to the spec and go, "We said we wanted this feature, and this is what we got. Do those two match up?"

At that point, and I used to meet with my QA lead, especially in the last few months, we meet every week. We'd talk about this feature, go over his notes, go over my notes. Anyone in QA ahead would give their notes to the QA lead. I keep saying him because in my head, the last one was Taylor Swope on Outer Worlds, great QA lead. Then, you meet, you talk about this, and it revisions are put in. You talk to the producer, and you go, "Hey, these things aren't quite right. They need to be changed." That gets scheduled, time estimates, but for about how long it would take to do, and when it will get done. That loop between those two, test it, revise, look at it, revise it, that loop happens frequently until you're happy with the feature, or the game ships, whichever comes first. In many, many of my games, and I'm talking about this, the shipping comes first.

**Credits**

For Arcanum, I'm not even sure that loop even happened once. In Arcanum, you're playing several features in the identical way they were implemented from the spec without any chance to balance or compare out and interact with other features. That's what was great about Outer Worlds, is those loops were maintained, so a lot of things got balanced, debugged. Outer Worlds was a very bug-free product. I was really proud of that.

So, at this point, I said, "Okay, so the game ships." Let's talk about credits because I've mentioned this before, but now that we've walked through this process of implementing a feature, who takes credit for that feature? I could say, "Well, it was my idea. I get the credit." But then, look at all the people who touched it. There are many people who may have said, "Whoa, that was your idea, but we heavily modified it," or "I pointed out all these problems, and it got massively changed." The programmer implementing it say, "Oh, I found a way of implementing it with using these other systems," or an artist go, "Hey, I modified that UI so it could support that." All these people had their hands on it, and some of them may have had their hands on it for a lot longer than, "Gee, I had this idea. I wrote it down. I bounced it off a few people, wrote a spec, three days later, I washed my hands of it and walked away," meanwhile, there's some programmer, artists that spent months on it. How do you credit that? Who, when somebody goes, "Who's responsible for that feature?" Was it the person who originated it? Was it the person who worked hard on the revision steps, either on the spec or after it was implemented, to get it right? Was it the person who spent the huge amount of time actually implementing it, doing the code, or the art that supported this feature? That's why it's really hard to do credits because you're done, this feature is implemented, but so many people can point to it and go, "I did that." That's why I find it hard to write credits with anything connecting them to any feature, and why it's hard for me when people ask on the channel to go, "Hey, Tim, who did this?" That's a very different question from, "Whose idea was this?" "Who implemented this?" "Who actually got it working correctly?" "Who balanced it?" Those are all wildly different questions with often very different answers of what person did that. So, that's why it's hard to answer, "Hey, who's responsible for this feature?"

Anyway, so this, you notice, this stage from writing it down to it shipped, and you're trying to figure out the credits is one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten steps. A lot of work by a lot of people, and it's only getting more complicated as games get bigger. I hope, though, Wyatt's Vlog, this answers your question of how you go from exploring the idea of a feature to implementing it to shipping it.

Focus Group Testing.md

https://youtu.be/sCGeOsHV4Ag?si=Uso_AMGFYcFggm-b

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim, and today I want to talk about focus groups because I have a LoveHate relationship with focus group testing and I've had this for decades. They weren't used much in the 80s or '90s, got really popular in the 2000s T, and now the 20s. So let me tell you a little bit about what a focus group is and then I'll tell you why I like them and then I'm going to tell you why I hate them.

Focus groups are when people are invited, and sometimes paid, to come in and play a version of your game and give feedback. Sometimes that feedback is undirected, they're just asked what' you think. Sometimes there's a Q&A where someone very objectively and unemotionally will go, "What did you think of inventory? What did you think of combat? Did you enjoy the story?" and just see what people said. Interestingly, focus groups are almost 100% publisher done, publisher handled. Publishers want them; they I sometimes view it as they're not sure their own opinion on the game so they figure hey let's get a bunch of people to play it and see what their opinion of the game is. I think it also comes from marketing where a lot of times this is done, you know, you're testing a new Doritos flavor so you get a bunch of people to come in and eat Doritos.

**What I like about Focus Group Testing**

Let me tell you why I like focus group testing first because there are some really good stuff that has come out of focus group tests. Both of the things I like about focus group test comes from the fact that the group is recorded, and they're recorded in two different ways which lead to two different things I love about focus group testing. One is very obvious, they're videoed. They're often even told their video and they're like there's the camera or the camera's right above the computer so we can see their face and then there's a recording made of them playing so we usually see a screen of what they see in the game and then their face is inset at the bottom so we can watch that. What we usually look use these for, and this is a great use of focus test, we watch them to see where they get confused or frustrated or even angry because this tells you where you need to direct your efforts frequently. UI does this, people are like I can't, I hate this inventory system or I don't understand this pop-up or I don't know what those little sparkly around the icon mean and this can tell you, this can be used to instruct your group hey we need way better tells, we need way better interface, iconography. Sometimes people will get frustrated in narrative, they're find NPCs to be annoying or it's not obvious what the NPC is trying to tell you or it's not obvious what they're supposed to be doing in the storyline, or sometimes they feel too directed in the storyline and they're like I just wanted to explore this area but I was told I had two minutes to get over to the other side of the map or they made it sound like someone was dying if I didn't move right then so you sometimes get feedback like that and you can talk about it, especially if a lot of people in the focus group give that feedback.

**Heat Maps**

The other thing I love about focus groups, and this is a way that a lot of people who are in them don't know how they're being recorded, we call them heat maps so that's what I'm going to call them. They may be called something different at different companies or they may be called something different now but a heat map is basically the game logs the player's position every time an event happens. The most basic heat map is whenever the player moves it logs that location, the new location. What that lets you do is it lets you look at a zone in the game and see where people tend to go and if there's more dots in one area you can make it brighter, some people color it, and you can see well people spend a lot of time over here, people rarely go here. We did one at Carbine and was awesome because there was a place we were planning to put an instance later, a dungeon instance that you had to either fly to or get an NBC to take you to and we did a focus group and some woman got up there and I'm like what, how did she get up there and because we had the the trail and the heat map we saw what happened was there was a uh a cliff face it was slightly angled but it was way too steep to crawl up but there was a rock here and a smaller rock here, she jumped here, she jumped here, and then she just barely jump to the top and I'm like oh we never thought that anybody would get there, we need to fix that. So you can have other heat maps too, a really common heat map is where whenever a player dies you put a dot because then you may see a zone and there are some light dots everywhere and then there's a heavy concentration of dots right here and you find out a level designer dropped a level 30 creature in a level five zone. Now it doesn't mean you got to delete it, you may even like that but it may mean hey maybe we should Telegraph that, maybe the only road into that valley should have an NPC saying be careful there's a gorgon in there, watch out just so play some players will go I'm not, I'm not going to do that. Some other common heat maps are whenever the player loses hit points, whenever combat begins, whenever player finds an item and then you can get this wonderful visual of here's a dungeon or an outdoor zone and you see this concentration of where well that's where players tend to get most of their items or this is where players tend to get money or this is where players get legendary items. You can, you can record any event you want and in fact often you log all of those into an external log file and then heat maps are generated from that so you don't think of it as it's writing out pixels into a map, it's just logging events into a file somewhere, maybe a SQL file, maybe a text file, and then later on you can generate all kinds of heat maps from it. That's what I love, I love using that, it's a very objective way of measuring people playing your game.

**Why I Hate Focus Groups**

So why do I hate focus groups? Let me tell you. First of all, most people don't know why they like something or hate something. They think they do and they will tell you at length why they like it or hate it but many times they don't know, they don't or the reason they say they like it or hate it isn't, doesn't seem to be the real reason they like it or hate it because keep in mind some people will love or hate certain features no matter what. If you love crafting you may play a game and go I love crafting, I love the crafting in here even though the crafting UI is terrible and none of the crafting items are usable are any better than things you can find in the world. Some people love it, they like oh I just liked it because I could dye it black because I like having my character wear all black clothes, okay not exactly what you wanted to get out of your crafting system but I'm just

 telling you what they say they like, they don't know why they like it, many many people fall in that category. Also people will often intentionally or not spread that feeling to other unrelated features, they may play your game, hate the combat in it, and then start complaining about other things that have nothing to do with combat and you're not even sure they dislike it, they've just, they got so frustrated by combat that now other features are making them angry. They will often contradict other people in the focus group, you have one focus group playing the same version of the game, some of them loved combat, some of them hated it, there even sometimes give the same reason, oh I hated it because it was turned bed, oh I loved it, finally I got a turn-based game, I love turn-based, okay. Sometimes they contradict themselves, they will say something like I hate it when a game hand holds me, I hate it when it tells me what to do, oh by the way you don't have quest markers on your map, you need to add quest markers and you're like what do they want. Sometimes people on your own team will cherry-pick folks group comments to support their own ideas or to criticize other ideas in a way that always amazingly corresponds to their own design wishes and this I've seen this happen, it might be people on your team, it might be people in management, it might be people at the publisher but they always say oh see I told you, I told you they wouldn't like combat, yeah one guy out of 50 focus testers didn't like it which which leads me to another thing, sometimes people don't mention what they like, they only talk about what they didn't like and then there's the other people who only say things they like and they're too polite or sweet to say anything they didn't like so sometimes you have to listen and go okay no one's saying they like combat, is that because combat is good or avoidable or is it really bad. UI is terrible that way because and I feel bad for UI artists and programmers and designers, when UI is really good a lot of people don't mention it, the only time they mention it is when it's frustrating them so again you have to be very careful how you look at comments from focus groups.

**Personal Reasons for Disliking Focus Groups**

But I think there's a personal reason that I tend to dislike focus groups and this is me, I've talked about lenses, this is my lens, you can go back to interviews at Troa where I say I make my games for me, I hope other people will like them, I really do cuz you kind of want it to sell but I usually made my games for me. That wasn't always the case early in my career, you know someone else was in charge and I, when I was 16 I didn't say anything and then maybe on BST tail and rags to riches I would make a suggestion but someone else had the final call. On my games, I was the final call and I always had an idea of what I wanted to make and I want, I took ideas from other people, you know if they offered things, but they had to fit the overall vision of what the game was and I've thought about this a lot to try to put it in a context of not games and the nearest I can think of is if it's a difference between a singer who writes her own songs and a singer who has a songwriting staff, the first one seems to sing more from the heart, their songs are more personal. The latter may get in the top 10 more often because they got a wide range of people writing songs for them and some of them can be like that's all they do is craft top 10 pop songs and then the question subjectively is which is better, um it's hard to say which music is better, I mean with the latter is it even their music, are they even good, are they just a good performer, this is all very personal, it's very subjective and I always said personally I just wanted to make my game and I hope people like it. Once you start using focus groups too much it becomes a committee and I don't think committee games are really good, it doesn't matter whether it's a management committee, it doesn't matter whether it's a publisher committee, doesn't matter that it's a focus group committee, once you have a group doing group think on something artistic whether it's a painting or a TV show or a video game I think it becomes a lesser product, it becomes less particular. I think many of my games have a similar feel to them and the ones that don't are ones that I didn't have the final say on so Fallout in Arcanum, Temple, vampire, outer worlds, they all kind of have this similar vibe to them because I made a lot of decisions in those games, probably not as much on Bloodlines but Leonard and Jason and I were all in the same ballpark. Anyway, I think focus group testing has its usage but I think a lot of things I listed about not liking about it are kind of the dangers of using focus group testing and whether or not you knew you wanted to hear it those are my thoughts on focus groups.

Frequently Asked Questions.md
Youtube Link:
https://youtu.be/0IZwda2fCKY?si=KyZ3gDEbGNsXUNtZ

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim. The channel has now passed 15,000 subscribers. I'm still reading all the comments, but I have given up on replying to any of them. I used to reply to some occasionally, but part of it is there's just too many coming in too fast. Literally, while I was answering a question, another question would come in. Also, I've noticed that even when I've answered questions, people then ask the same question, sometimes in the same section.

So, what I decided to do is I gathered up a lot of questions that have been asked multiple times, and I'm going to answer them here. This is going to be my first FAQ - my first frequently asked questions. I can't imagine there won't be others. I'm not going to call this Fact one, but it probably is in fact one.

So, let me start with saying this channel is for me to talk about game development, stories of my own games. That's the only goal, that's the only purpose. There's no other agenda. I'm not trying to start a Kickstarter, I'm not making a new IP that I'm going to spring out later. I'm certainly not trying to reform Troika. I've held Leonard and Jason, I love them to death, but we did that, it's done. I don't want to really game company again.

Something that I've had to say repeatedly, because it this is probably the most frequently asked question, is "Are you gonna remaster Fallout or Bloodlines?" I do not own any of the rights to Fallout, Arcanum, or Bloodlines, so I can't remaster those or make sequels to those or anything. If it shouldn't fall out, contact Bethesda, they own all the rights. If you want to know about Arcanum, Bloodlines, contact Activision, they own all the rights.

Now, as a little side note, I do own the code to Arcanum and Temple. That was part of the contract. I can't release that code, that was also part of the contract. Just for funsies, I recompiled Arcanum recently, modern compiler under modern windows. It generated a surprisingly large number of warnings. Yeah, I suppose it shouldn't be that surprising, especially since it was a C uh code base that I was compiling on a C++ compiler. But it compiled, and it runs.

So, I'm just throwing it out there as this code is recompilable. Most of my code in the 90s and early 2000s was written to be operating system independent. I hid all the operating system calls in a library. It was called Canal at Interplay, for "Ganos Not Windows," and it was called TIG at Troika, for "TIG is in Canal," because, you know, backwards and forward. Acronyms are funny to me like that. Because of that, most of the work on getting these games running was just updating that one library. Questions, so it can be done.

I've said this multiple times in both videos and answering questions. I'm not an employee anywhere, I'm a contractor. Which means I'm self-employed, and I'm not even a full-time contractor. But what I mean by that is, I'm not working at Obsidian, I'm not an employee of Obsidian or Microsoft or anywhere else. I am working on Outer Worlds 2 as a contractor, a design contractor. I'm not a director, I'm not involved in any of the big decisions or even the main decisions. So, I'm working on it, that's about all I can say.

There have been a lot of people asking me to play other people's or other companies' games or to rank them or to review them. I'm not going to do that. It's not the point of my channel, and there's also a lot of other channels doing that a lot better than I ever could. If you don't believe me, go watch Leonard and I playing Fallout, um, Adam City, a few years ago. It... you don't want to watch us stumble around in our old games.

Let's see, I wrote all these questions down so I could answer them. Oh, I didn't work on Fallout New Vegas. In fact, I started at Obsidian a year after it shipped. A lot of people have asked me what my role was or what I did with it. I didn't work on it. I did, however, play it. I played it multiple times. I've played all the DLCs. I have uh, joined, I finished it with joining Yes Men, with joining House. I did one playthrough where I was Cannibal, and I ate all the leaders of all the factions, and I got that that great perk you get for doing so, although I imagine that Mr. House kind of was like old beef jerky. But, yep, that was a fun playthrough too. I really, really love, I love and admire what that team did because not only did it feel really OG Fallout, but they did that in the same amount of time I did Temple, and New Vegas rocks. If you haven't played it, play it.

I've had questions about things that I didn't witness. I've also had people I worked with email me and say, "Oh, by the way, this happened." So, I want to make it clear, I'm not going to talk about any events that I didn't witness personally because I don't want to tell you what someone else was thinking or feeling or planning because I don't know. I, all I can tell you is these are things that I saw people do, and then you can draw whatever conclusions, although I implore you not to turn it into a dramatic retelling of heroes and villains, even though some of you are going to do that.

I'm not going to start doing regular interviews with other developers that I work with. Yes, that one I did with Leonard was super fun, and I think I need to have him back because there's just too much stuff I don't remember or wasn't involved in on the projects we did, and I'll try to get Jason and a few others, but I'm not going to turn this into an interview channel. Again, that's not what I intended to do. This is more of hey, I've done game development for 40 years, maybe you can learn from some of my mistakes and some of the stories I'm going to tell.

Why, which leads me to why I am doing this. 42 years is a long time to work in any field, much less game development. I have a lot of stories; they cover a lot of things. I'm not even, I've even scratched the surface of some big topics I want to touch. But if you're wondering why I'm doing it now and this way, I did try writing a book. It was over 500 pages. I had a few people read it; apparently, it's a bit of a downer. What I learned was I can write one of these stories, and the feedback I get from people is uh, it was confusing, it was disjointed, uh, sometimes it felt mean-spirited. But then when I tell the story, people are like, "Oh, wow, that's really positive. I

 like, I like your take on it." I don't get that other than I think I've had to learn the lesson again that I'm not a good writer. Apparently, I storytell better than I story write, so you're getting videos and and notebook. The book exists, though, but you're not going to see it.

The other reason I'm doing it is kind of personal. I am now 57 years nine months old. That is the exact days my father was when he passed away. I was 24 when he passed. I, I was not encouraged by him in any way, um, to do almost anything. My parents were divorced when I was young. My mom encouraged me to do a lot of things, but when my father passed away, I was in my second year of the PhD program. I had done two years of a master's at UCI, and then I was doing two years, I was two years into PhD, which actually, since it technically you go there to get a PhD, I was in the fourth year of a PhD. I, was questioning whether I wanted to do it, and when my father passed away, it kind of made me think, what do I want to do with my life? The one thing I ever did that made me super happy all the time was making video games. So, I decided to do that, and everybody in my life, friends, family members, colleagues, classmates, were all like, "Your throat, you're wasting, you're wasting your life," except my mom. She said, "I figured I think might always do some." Everyone came around. My thesis advisor, fellow graduate students who also came to work at the same company I did years later, they all came around and saw the game industry for what it was, which is a really exciting, fun place to work, and difficult.

So, I wanted to do all that and tell those stories, but the reason I'm doing it right now is because I was thinking, wow, this is when my dad passed away. I've got all these stories, and they're just sitting around. I would like to get them documented somewhere. And it's hard to tell these stories because they're true stories. Like I said in the Nuance video, this isn't stuff I'm making up. It's really hard to tell these stories, though, because everybody remembers it differently. Even though I've taken notes, I've had multiple people tell me, "Oh no, that wasn't quite right," and usually, the difference is something, a nuance. For example, Leonard reminded me that the temple at the beginning of Fallout 2, we already had that as a level. It was where you went to go get your grandparents' vault suit. But nothing I've said is really incorrect; it was a starting level. It was a level in the starting zone that you went to go get the suit, it was skippable, and I'm trying to remember how that worked. I think either you could, if you had a dialogue character, you could just say, "Give me the Vault suit," and they gave it to you. If you were a stealth character, you could just sneak in and grab it. You only had to fight through if you were a combat character. So, the level was kind of skippable anyway, and it was by no means a tutorial. It wasn't set up as being a tutorial. That was all mandated to us from, it was either the executive producer or marketing, somebody mandated it. I tried to get rid of it; it didn't happen. So, it was reformed into a tutorial level. So, everything I said is true, but it's also what Leonard reminded me is true. We had that anyway, but it was by no means the form that shipped.

Just yesterday, somebody wrote me, one of the programmers I worked with at Interplay, and said, "Hey, I remember you working on that random number generator for your group star system generator, not for Fallout specifically," and he's probably right. I just remember really focusing on like, "This random library in C is very bad, and I'm not getting the numbers I want." So, it's true. I just, my notes sometimes are written linearly, but the dates aren't linear, so I need to keep an eye on that.

So, what am I saying? With all these stories I'm telling and people trying to turn into heroes and villains, I'm just saying remember that perspective changes everything. There are different people involved in these stories, and they have a different perspective on them. My own perspective on some of these stories has changed over time. I look back on some of these things differently now that I'm in my 50s than when they happened to me in my 20s. I've said this before, ironically, even though my color vision is fading, I see things in less than black and white anymore, and I very much urge you to do the same.

So, I hope I answered a lot of the frequently asked questions, and tomorrow I will resume telling stories.
Title:
Fun vs Realism.md
Youtube Link:
https://youtu.be/TshXDFgfiTg?si=YLnPeimjzTqHDGJE

Hi everyone, it's me Tim, and today I want to talk about game design: fun versus realism. This has come up in the past. I've often said in other videos I like making games to be fun. I don't care about realism. I don't care about balance. I mean, I do, but to me, fun is far more important, and that's what I wanted to talk about. I want to talk about what I mean specifically in different parts of a game.

So let's start with movement. This is one that we can talk about because everybody knows what realistic movement is. You know how high you can jump. You know how fast you can run. In almost every RPG, your character runs a lot faster than most humans and for a lot longer, way longer than Usain Bolt. You also jump way higher from a standstill or a broad jump. You jump way higher and way farther than most humans can do it. I had an old boss who called this the joy of movement. He actually thought this was a good thing, that having unrealistic running and jumping was a good thing for a game, and I agree with them. This is an example of where a lot of people, they rarely complain, "Hey, this is unrealistic that my character can jump this far," because it's fun. And I love leading with this because I think it's the one area in an RPG I've never heard anyone say, "My character can jump unnaturally high. It ruined the game for me." Never heard anyone say that. So, obviously, at least in that, I think everybody agrees fun trumps realism.

But now let's talk hit points because I've seen people, especially when monsters have a lot of hit points and people call them bullet sponges, and they think it's unfun and unrealistic. Let me tell you about when we were making Fallout, and it was originally under GURPS. The way GURPS works, you have as many hit points as your health, at least Third Edition worked this way, which meant you started with around 10 hit points, maybe a few less, maybe a few more, and that's all you ever had. D&D, you may start off with less than 10, although there's a number of classes that can start with a lot more than 10, but every time you go up a level, you get more hit points, and that wasn't happening in our early versions of Fallout, and that was really hard to make the character feel like they were becoming progressively more powerful. The only way you had to do it was giving them better armor with better damage threshold and damage resistance, but that didn't feel like you... um, yes, it let you last a little longer in combat. The other problem we were having was, and I used to tell people this story all the time, was in D&D, when you're being attacked, it's like you have a lot of health, and you get hit, and you get hit again, and you get hit again, and you see your health dropping, you're like, "H, I may need to heal, or maybe I need to run away." That's not my experience with GURPS. GURPS tended to be like this: I dodge and take nothing. I dodge and take nothing. I dodge and take nothing. I hit and I'm pretty much dead. I'm either almost dead or I'm pretty much dead, and since your skills are reduced by the amount you took, anything you attempt to do after being hit that one time was at a huge penalty. So, this was causing a lot of trouble in early Fallout. I remember somebody on the team said, "You know, when movies show heroes shrugging off an injury, uh, either during or after combat, we're not having that experience here." And I was like, "Yeah, yeah." So, we were thinking about doing the optional GUR splitting health and um hit points into two and letting you buy up extra hit points and doing that like way past what the rules were going to allow, but in the end, we went a different direction in Fallout.

And then finally, I talked about economy in a previous video, and I talked about how hard it was to balance economies, and this is where the fun versus realism thing comes in again because in most RPGs, rewards are sources of money and wealth. You're given items. You're given gold directly. So, that's a source coming in of wealth. Well, all of the sinks, all the ways that you have that a designer puts in for a player to avoid paying money, a lot of them are the sinks that we put in to make the player pay money are often avoidable. You can make a character that doesn't use weapons like or armor like a monk, and now you don't have to pay for fixing those things if there's degradation. Um, if you have to pay to sleep somewhere, some people just don't, either they play on a simpler difficulty level that doesn't require sleep or food, or they only sleep in their ship or their house or whatever. They try to avoid all the sinks that are in the game. I'm okay with this because I'm trying to design a game that's fun, not a game that's realistic, and if people end up with a million coins at the end of the game, I don't really mind that much. And that pretty much is my big rule, my top-level rule is fun trumps realism. I believe this so strongly that was a design pillar, and I believe the first design pillar of The Outer Worlds, and I had to use that when people were arguing that they wanted to change something because they thought it was a little unrealistic. I'd always say, "If it's fun, we're keeping it because fun trumps realism. If your only arguing against something is 'This is unrealistic,' we're keeping it." Now, note that that doesn't mean that if rules are crazy, if they're hard to understand, especially if they're inconsistent, then you can make an argument for getting rid of them, but I would also argue that a lot of those kinds of rules make the game not fun. If the game is too hard to predict what's going to happen, and things are inconsistent, sometimes a rule applies, and sometimes it doesn't, that's not fun. So, fun seems to catch that. You rarely have to bring it up and say, "Hey, you're being inconsistent here." I'm like, "I know. It's totally not fun."

I also find that sometimes people get mad at a lack of realism, but what they really mean is when realism hurts them, but they don't mind when it helps them, which seems a little teensy bit hypocritical. I'll give you an example. I think in Arcanum, when you stole an item, people just knew it was stolen. You know, that's why you had to go find a black market fence to sell things to, and people complain, "Well, how do they know it's stolen? How do they magically know that that item is stolen?" And I'm like, "Well, that's interesting because that item you stole, you save scummed to get the lock picked, and then as soon as you grab the item, you fast traveled away. Neither of those things are realistic, and I don't hear you complaining about those

." So, that's why I always did the fun trumps realism because things can be fun if they help the player or get rid of drudgery. They can also be fun if they introduce some challenge. I don't care whether they're realistic. I just care whether it's fun. In fact, if I had to make a list, fun would be first. Realism, probably in my top five, it might be third or fourth. It's in my top five, but it's not up there. It's not, I'm sure, certainly not second. I'm trying to think of what second would be, but it's not realism.

I rarely even have this discussion when we're talking about the science weapons in Outer Worlds. Certainly, realism didn't factor into those. I wasn't like, "Hm, anti-gravity gun? I don't think so." It was, "This is fun. This shrinks people." The whole face rearranger one was just started as a joke, and now it's a science weapon in the shipped game. I love that.

So, for all you people who are embarking on game design, here's my recommendation: one, make your rules and stick to them. Don't necessarily worry about whether those rules are realistic, and don't worry about whether they're pro or anti-player. Don't worry whether this rule is something that helps the player out, or this rule is something that will challenge the player. Don't worry about that. Just worry, is this rule fun? Will the player have fun with this? Make sure all your rules are consistent. Don't do something like this works for the player, but NPCs, it doesn't work for the NPCs. I there are some things I get around on that, like it's fun to knock an NPC out, but it's not fun to knock a player out, so even though that's a little inconsistent, I allow it. It's mostly things like if this is a place the player can get to, the NPC should be able to get there too. Um, I don't like the player being able to climb up to something and then attack things from that perch, and other people can't get to them. So, I like consistency, but and here's where my big caveat, and I talked about this on save scumming and player hoarding and um, when people ask about whether I disliked speedrunning, here's my role. I want players to explore the world I created with those rules, which were made to be fun and consistent. I want you to explore that world and have fun with it, and if you discover an exploit, have fun with it. I like exploits. I'm more worried about a player not being able to reach the end of my storyline in my RPG with a valid character. I'm much more worried about that than a player reaching the end of the storyline with a million coins or having robbed every single vendor along the way or them finding a way to make all the factions love them, and then they get a very strange ending. I'm fine with all that. I think it's fun, and I think it's funny, and I think if players love it, they should do more of it. But the bottom line is if you're designing a game, you should always be thinking, is this fun? Everything else secondary, and realism tertiary, quinary, quinary... Oh well, those are my thoughts on fun and realism.

Game Design Specification Sections.md

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim, and today I want to talk about all the different design specifications that a single game may need. About a month ago, I gave an example of how to write a design specification and gypsum generation asks what are all the design specifications that a game might need. Okay, that is a very long answer, so grab your coffee. Also, I'm going to put a big caveat on this and say the answer really depends on the game you're making because different games will have different sections in their design specification.

So let's pretend we're making a fantasy RPG, and I will tell you what the design specs should include. I'll break it down into what all the main sections of the design specification are, and then for each one of those sections, I'll talk about subsections they should have. Why don't you take a look at my writing design specifications for exactly the kind of details you will have to put in each one of those subsections.

So let's start with the setting. Remember a long time ago, I said whenever you put together a new game, you should do setting and then story and then system mechanics. The setting should basically describe the world that everything is set in, what the major areas in it that will be covered in the game because you may have a big world, but you're only going to cover this section of it. You want to talk about the history of the whole world and especially detailed history in that section you're going to have your game in, and then talk about what kind of people are in this world, what kind of animals, what kind of monsters so you can lay the groundwork for here's what's going up here in the game.

The next thing after setting is story. The story basically consists of the main acts you're going to go through. I think I mentioned in Fallout, there were only three acts: find the water chip, stop the mutants, and stop the master. Arcanum conversely had 27 acts, so it was a lot more complicated. I believe the correct number of Acts lies somewhere in between those two; both of those were a little extreme. Your story should also detail all of the key characters. These will be the characters that move your story along. They'll probably give most of the main story quests. In some games, you may mark them as essential that they can't be killed. In my games, what this means is these key characters, you have to come up with how the story will progress if the player decides to kill them, whether it's a secondary NPC steps up to the plate, or you find their journal or on them is some thing that leads you on to the next stage of the quest, something like that. But you should mark out what your key story characters are in your story section.

Then this brings you to the system mechanics. There are a ton of sections that you would have to cover on this, each one with a ton of subsections. I'm not even going to begin to detail the subsections, but I will tell you what they are. So let's start with the character system mechanics. These are things like attributes, skills, spells, perks, traits, backgrounds, races, flaws. Now, you may not have all of these, but you'll probably have a good chunk of them, and you have to describe in each one of those subsections, you have to describe what these things are, how they're obtained, how they can be raised during the game, you know what the ranges are, what you're expected to do when the character goes up a level, and whether, of course, whether or not they can be respeced. This leads you into a description of character creation from a mechanical point of view. Remember when I talked about inventory the other day, I said you have to do the system mechanics and the user interface separately. Same thing for character creation. So you're talk about this is what gets selected by the player at character creation. You talk about whether they're given points to spend or whether they do rolls, whether they can roll things like that. Then you talk about exactly the mechanics of leveling up. Every time the player gains a level, what happens. Then you talk about all the status effects that can exist in the game. Maybe these status effects come from perks or skills or backgrounds, maybe they come from spells, maybe they come from items when they're equipped, maybe they come during combat, maybe they come from hazards in the environment, but these are things like poison, slowed, frozen, electrified, prone, knocked down, knocked out. There could easily be three, four, five dozen of these. I've worked on games that had over 100 status effects. You're going to have a lot. Status effects are maintained usually by mod that keeps track of how long they last, what applied them, how long they last, how they interact with other status effects, that kind of thing, and you will have to describe those in excruciating detail in a status effect section.

Then I think the last major section here would be inventory. We talk about how encumbrance works, what different equipment slots exist on the player and maybe NPCs, which leads you into combat. Combat is a big section, tons of subsections. You want to basically talk about what kind of combat you have at a high level, what kind of mode you operate in. Is it real time, is it real time with pause, is it turn-based? Then you're talk about how skills work in combat, what the rules are for hitting, for missing, for critical hitting, for critical missing, if you have any of those things. How weapons work, melee versus ranged, projectile or hit scan. Talk about the magic versions that exist of these. You have to go in very in excruciating detail. Now I gave an example for my design specification of how you'd make one weapon. You're going to have a ton of those in this section, very, very similar to that. You're going to have a lot of armor described, what slots they go into because sometimes you have tons of armor slots. You have helm and face and torso and arms and legs and hands and feet, and then you're going to have to talk about what magical versions exist for this. Keep in mind, you'll probably be going back and adding things into the status effect section as you invent new magical versions of armor and weapons. Finally, you talk about creatures, what kind of creatures exist in the world, animals, monsters, any kind of NPC that you run into, what kind of abilities they have, what kind of attacks they do. This may add even more status effects into your status effect section.

Then another major section in system mechanics is dialogue. You're explaining exactly how dialogue works, how you want it to branch, any restrictions you have. We like on many of my games, there was no more than five nodes in any one dialogue node could ever be displayed at the same time. So if you had conditions so you had more than one line, you had to make sure that none of those, no more than five of those lines ever could have their condition to be true. Talk about how skills work in dialogue, you talk about how NPC reaction works in dialogue, how dialogues affects NPC reaction and how NPC reaction affects dialogues.

Then that gets you into the stealth section. Keep in mind, see I'm going combat, dialogue, stealth. If those are

 super important, they should all have their own section. Stealth will describe how hiding works in general, if it interacts with lighting and cover, excruciating you know, how NPCs detect them. You want to talk about locks, what kind of difficulties they are, how it interacts with whatever skills and perks you have. You want to talk about what kind of path want made that are stealth for quests that include tunnels and vents and hacking into computers and you know, picking open cabinets that would have files in them, all kinds of stuff like that. You will need detail descriptions of how NPCs detect the player doing all these things, hiding, picking locks, hacking computers, and what happens when that happens, what is the reaction of the NPC to finding the player doing these things.

If you're going to have companions, you're going to have to have a whole section on them, detailing exactly how companions work, including where the player will get them. Each one is probably different. When they show up in the main story arc, you probably don't want you know, somebody showing up in the 19th chapter of your 20 act story arc. How to keep NPC companions, can they leave, can they decide to leave, how many companions exist in the game, how many can you have at the same time. Is it depending on an attribute or a perk or a skill. You want to talk about bonuses and penalties related to companions. Maybe some companions give you a bonus when they're in the party, maybe some give you a restriction like you're not allowed to kill good people when this companion's around, things like that. Also, you want to talk about the companions and how they not only fit into the main storyline because they'll have reactions to it as you go along, but you also want to talk about whatever storylines the companions have on their own because often when you get a companion, they have their own set of quests that they want you to do, and that tells a story about problems the companions has and how he wants help from the player to resolve them.

You want an entire section on economy, which includes loot and loot tables and how it's distributed among different NPCs and in encounters. You want to talk about vendors and how they get loot. You're probably want to throw a section in here about crafting and how that would work and where the materials come from and what things can be crafted because that's a really big effect on economy.

You want to talk about the areas in the game. Remember you mentioned them in the earlier section on the setting. Here's where you go into excruciating detail about how big they are, cities, towns, dungeons, castles, what NPCs are there, what encounters are preset that they're always there, and then random encounters that you can have, maybe it's random in the dungeons, maybe it's random in the wilderness. This is where you define it.

And then finally, you're going to go through user experience, which you can break up into three subsections: pregame, out of game, and in-game. Pregame would be anything that the player sees before they're actually playing the game. Maybe there's a main menu that pops up that has new game, load game, options, credits, quit. Speaking of options, you know, that could have things for setting your visual stuff, visual settings, audio settings, accessibility, any other options you've set for the game, combat options. Some of those you might want to set before the game starts, others are set while you're playing the game, and I call those out of game menus because they're not things that are supposed to be handling stuff that are in-game but it's stuff you go out of the game to do like pausing, save game, and some options. This is where you need to be careful because you're going to have several options that once set apply to every game and other options that once set only apply to the game you're setting them at. So if you're at the pregame menu and you go to set options, if you set game difficulty, that just means by default games will be this difficulty when you start any new game. But if you actually start a game and change the difficulty, you probably mean I just want to set the difficulty of that particular game. So you have to decide all these things and say exactly what you mean here.

Then there's all the in-game UX that has to be made. The HUD, the character screen, is it, and if it's different for level up, you need a level up screen, you need an inventory screen, you need a journal for quests and rumors and notes, you need a dialogue UX, you need looting and bartering and pickpocketing and using local maps and world maps, a sleep weight UX will probably be needed, and you need something just basically for messages. Hey, the player's taken damage, hey, the player has fallen down, hey, the player is now on fire. Those have to be displayed somewhere. So you have all of that stuff to go through.

Now while doing this, here's a couple considerations you may want to keep in mind. These either their own sections or they're part of the sections I just described, and I've got three of these. The first one is PC versus NPC. Sometimes you write things like attributes or skills and everybody's got them, PC, NPC, and they work the same, but frequently they don't work the same. And I'll give you an example. You may have a melee skill that says when it's really high, you can knock out the opponent if you hit them, or maybe you have a c shot saying if you hit a with a bludgeoning attack to someone's head, you have a chance to knock them out. That's super fun for a PC to do to an NPC, but it's really not fun for player characters to get knocked out. So you probably will say knockout cannot be applied to a player character. Similarly, you may not have flying for the player. You may want him to always be ground-based, but you may have some NPCs that fly. You may have bats that attack, you may have a dragon that flies in and lands and attacks. That's okay because NPCs can fly and you can control when and where they fly. You won't have a dragon try to go into a house and fly. If you let players fly, that's the first thing they're going to try to do.

Similarly, you have to think if you have multiplayer because once you have multiplayer, some game features may disappear. For example, you may not want turn-based combat in your multiplayer game. So if you provide both modes, you're probably not going to allow that in multiplayer. Similarly, you may let people make their own character for the single-player game, but in a multiplayer game, either they're handed a character or they go in into someone else's campaign, single-player campaign, and they take over one of the companions. So they don't get to make a character in multiplayer, or maybe they do, and everybody has to make a character from scratch and start a new game every time. That's up to you.

Something that I've put in my more recent design specifications is a section called fallbacks or design fallbacks, and this is a place where you put simpler designs that can be used in place of other designs that are in there in case you either run out of time or it turns out they

're not working well, or for whatever reason you just need to fall back. I did this in Outer Worlds where there were several things that we said oh we couldn't get this working, here's the fallback. One of them was grenades. I wanted throwing grenades in the base game, but we really couldn't get the arcs working right, so we fell back, and I believe we ended up with a, I think we had some kind of grenade launcher, I don't remember. But we ended up taking out the handheld grenades which, by the side effect, took out a throwing skill that was in melee. It there was unarmed, which include throwing, so unarmed rolled into melee, and we got over throwing. Remember, the reason you often want these fallbacks is you often just can't delete something from the game and have no effect on anything else. Deleting grenades got rid of a skill, so some of it had to be rolled into other things. So I'd highly recommend doing that.

Just to give you an example, this is the Arcanum design specification printed out. It's 48 pages. So we have a digital version of this. I don't think I'm allowed to put it out though. Technically, it's still covered under the NDA, but so I won't be posting it, but I can tell you this was back when Arcanum was code-named Epic, which is also what we called our post-apocalyptic four potential fourth game, so it's very confusing in my files. It's 48 pages. There's a surprisingly lot of stuff in here that's very similar to what we shipped. I mean, this happened before any publisher even was interested in the game. And if you open it up, there's, let me see if I can show you this, there's a map which looks a lot like the map we shipped on that was in the world map and was on the cloth map. So I was like, hey, that's pretty impressive.

So it's also incomplete. There's a lot of user interface design that's missing at the end. We have them listed, but it says loot table TBD. We used this design dock to get a contract, and then after we got the contract with Sierra, they told us we had 90 days to make a prototype to keep the contract. So we had to take a subset of this design specification and say this is what we're have implemented after 90 days. It was, of course, a very small subset, but it was enough for them to see this is what the game is going to look like and play like when it ships.

Woo, that was a lot of stuff. Oh my goodness, I talked a long time. Okay, I think in general, that is all of the design specifications you might need to specify one game, in this particular case, a fantasy role-playing game. So gypsum generation, I hope this answers your question.

Game Designs that Impressed Me.md
Youtube Link:
https://youtu.be/n7BwHBhC4dw?si=-M6N6TmM7mMOdXIe

Hi everyone, it's me Tim. Today I want to answer another question, a good one from octopus RPG, who asks, "I'm curious if there are any games that you didn't work on with mechanics or design that made you think 'wow, I wish I had thought of that.'" Yes, there are so many that what I did is I went back and tried to look at my top six or seven, and it goes back quite a ways because I keep a lot of notes, as people know. In fact, I'm going to show you some, because throughout my career, I've encountered games that just made me go, "That's neat, I like that." Some of them had mechanics I never ended up using, some were ones that I'm like, "Hey, I'm going to make a modification of that." So, let me start at the beginning, going all the way back to the 80s. The first time I played **Ultima 3**, I had a ton of fun with that game. I think it's my favorite Ultima; it's also the first one I played. I'm frequently like that; like I like Baler's Gate one more than two, probably just cuz I played one first. But Ultima 3, I played before one and two, so I just kind of like Ultima 3 the best.

One of the things that was in there was there was a moon gate, and it was called a moon gate, and when you stepped into the moon gate, it seemed to teleport you at random to different outside different cities throughout the world. It probably took me longer to figure this out than other people, remember this is back before you could go look stuff up on the Internet. The moon gates were actually controlled by the phases of the moon, moons; there were two moons, and at the top of the interface, there were two little circles, and they would change phase as you play the game, and they're right next to the time, so I assume they were there just to give an indication of passage of time. No, depending on the phases of those two moons, they controlled where those moon gates went. Took me a long time to figure it out, when I did, I was like, "What a great idea," because you could then, by just glancing up at those phases, know exactly where the moon gate was going to take you.

There was something else actually in Ultima 3 that I noticed I kind of liked. It didn't like it as much as the moon gates, which was wind. The game would always tell you the direction that wind was blowing, and I wasn't sure why that was needed. They ended up using it for when you were running around in boats; the wind would control the direction your boat could go. You could never take your boat directly into the wind. Didn't use boats that much, used it occasionally; there were a few places you needed a boat to get to, but I thought that was kind of cool.

The next game I remember thinking, "Whoa," I've said how much I love **Star Control 2**, and that I do consider it to be an RPG, just happens to be that you're the ship, and all the upgrades apply to you, the ship. But it has everything else RPGs have: it has a big open world to explore, it has dialogue, it has inventory, it has levels, it has quests, it's a cool game. If you haven't played it, I think it holds up. But one thing that I thought was really interesting about Star Control 2 were hit points in that game were crew members. When there was—I don't remember if it was for every ship—but there were a lot of ships where when you took damage, and the bar went down, that was your crew getting killed; it was your crew being killed. There was one ship that powered its weapon, its powerful weapon, with hit points, which meant it was shoveling crew members into some kind of furnace to burn to shoot this weapon. Kind of blew my early 20-something brain.

The next game I remember going, "Wow, I love that idea," was the first time I played **Diablo**, and I played a few levels, got to the butcher, which apparently everybody gets to, I think it's like level five or 10, and my butcher level was different than other people's butcher levels. In fact, we talked about how we fought the Butcher, and we all realized some of the rooms were the same, but the rest of the dungeon was different. The dungeons were being procedurally generated. I thought that was super cool. I love procedural generation; I think AI is going to be a great tool for games, not just for conversation, but I think some procedural generation of details in a world, AI can do a great job with that. What's funny is the original D&D guy, DM's guide for AD&D, had dungeon generation in the back. And, as you all know, I keep notes; this is a book I have; it's just graph paper, and I generated dungeons at random when I was in high school, and I still have them. It's funny stuff, but these were all things that I made, just cuz I thought procedural generation was a neat idea, and I ran my high school D&D group through a few of them, and they didn't know it was procedurally generated; it just seemed like a typical dungeon to them, so plus-plus.

The next time I remember going, "Wow," ironically, was for **EverQuest**, not WoW. EverQuest was a really great MMO; in many ways, better than EverQuest. But EverQuest, when I first played it, and I realized, after all my years of playing LP MUD, that EverQuest was literally like LP MUD with a graphics front end wrapped around it, I was like, "Boom, this is transformative. This is going to change the way people play games online, and especially online RPGs." EverQuest just was—they did so many things right, even if it wasn't as polished as MMOs that would come afterward. And in many ways, I don't really care about the polish; I care about the ideas, and EverQuest was jam-packed with some really good ideas, and some frustrating ones, but to me, EverQuest was a game that made me go, "Take note, it's the late 90s, things are never going to be the same again."

And then, a couple of other games I want to talk about that when I played them, I went, "I like that." The first one was **Fallout 3** when I noticed that weapons and armor could degrade, but you could repair them with similar weapons and armor. What I loved about that idea, instead of just saying you have to go find generic screws and, you know, metal, it—you used your repair skill, so the amount repaired was proportional to your repair skill, but because some of those weapons were really common, it meant some guns were easier to keep repaired cuz you were always seeing these as drops, so you could use them to keep your weapon in top condition. Some things were really hard to find, like, I think, radiation suits—were they in Fallout 3, or were they only in Fallout New Vegas? But I remember they were very rare. So

 repairing them by finding a similar radiation suit, those were hard to find. So what I would often do is if I found a new radiation suit, I'd wear it until they were both worn down a little bit, then I'd combine them and make them better again. I like it because it made rare items either harder or more expensive, depending on how you wanted to look at it, harder to find them, or the fact that you were using them to repair rather than selling them. And I love that because the decision was entirely on the player, and I also loved how it made sense: "I'm going to repair this thing. Oh, I've got this other thing I can scavenge for parts." So, I love that idea.

The other thing I saw once came from Bethesda's other Fallout game, **Fallout 4**. I liked how they handled radiation. In our games, radiation was kind of like poisoning; it had an invisible meter because we didn't want to do another UI element. It would tell you when you got radiated, it would tell you when things started to affect you, so you knew something was happening, and then you could take radiation drugs, before, after, after to try to ameliorate it. What I loved about Fallout 4 was when you got near radiation, you heard it and saw it cuz I would pop up saying, you know, radiation plus 3, plus 4, but the radiation meter was your health meter. As your radiation, as you took radiation damage, it reduced your max XP. Now, I love this idea for multiple reasons: one, from a UI standpoint, it's brilliant. You have one meter that represents two different stats. From a system mechanic van uh standpoint, I love it too, because when you start taking radiation, it is automatically pushing down your maximum XP or maximum HP, so you know you're losing hit points, but your bar is still full because it's filling with radiation at the top end, so you see radiation increasing, and your max health going down. Even if you use a Dr. like, um, RadAway to get rid of that radiation, and it goes away, the high part of the bar, I think it's red, um, color-blind, I don't know, it goes away, you're still left with lower health. You then have to heal your health with stimpacks or going to a doctor, or um, sleeping in a bed. I love that idea because it makes radiation have side effects that you have to deal with that make sense. You're already, you already know the radiation has lowered your health; it's still lowered when you heal the radiation cuz radiation is healed separately than health. I love it; it is—it's, in my mind, it was kind of like the perfect mechanic because both in the way it worked systemically in the game, the way it presented itself through the UI to the player, and the way the player then had react to it and deal with it, we're all just great. It is something I like to point to, um, to uh junior designers and go, "That's an example of a perfectly implemented design feature." I don't know what their design pillars were, but it would hit all of mine about easy to understand, um, requires the player to handle, make sense on how to handle it. So, I like all that stuff.

So, I think, how many is that? One, two, three, four, five, six. Okay, that's six different games I've mentioned: Ultima 3, Star Control 2, Diablo, EverQuest, Fallout 3, and Fallout 4, all of which had mechanics or a general design that made me go, "Wow, I wish I had thought of that." And that was a great question, octopus RPG.
Title:
Game Development Caution Part 2.md
Youtube Link:
https://youtu.be/X9ejDUuu7Sc?si=ihqvHMbUBAD5KRjB

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim, and today I want to do part two of game development caution because that video got a lot of views and a lot of comments, and I kind of want to talk about it. Yeah, I know the lighting's weird; it is just dark in Seattle all the time sometimes. Today's a dark day, so I just turned on the overhead light. See how this goes.

So, I did a video on game developer caution and on the one hand, there was a lot of really good discussion about it, and that was great. I loved that there was discussion because that's kind of what the game development business needs. It needs people talking about things, talking about processes, talking about problems, just telling people this is what it's like so you can make an informed decision if this is the job you want to do. But there was a problem that ran through the comments on that video, and some of the places that picked up the video continued what I considered to be an issue with how that video was taken. And the problem was that they were focusing on individuals. People were listening to the stories I told and focusing on one of the individuals as the problem, and not what the problem was I was trying to illustrate. I mean, I can give you an example. There were a lot of people that said I was the bad guy, that I was the obvious bad boss, that I wasn't listening to the people who were working for me, I wasn't accepting their estimates, I was yelling in my office. It's funny, I know I kind of said we were yelling; we were just having a discussion. Um, and it bothered me when I found out, oh people are bother[ed], I'll shut the door, we'll go do it somewhere else. But the point of that was more of a people don't want to talk about issues in detail like that; they just most of them just want to be told what to do. Um, that's kind of the point. I wasn't saying that these people are bad. I'm saying the process that they find themselves involved in is bad. Um, a lot of people were like, oh you should have just fired some of those people involved. They didn't want the whiteboard up, fired, gave you bad estimates, fire them. That's totally missing the whole point of the video. Um, and I'm torn because I think when I'm talking about things, I do better when I give specific examples. It illustrates it and and and kind of roots it in reality and these are real problems that happen, these are real things that happen, but the problem is people when they focus on the wrong thing it makes me think that they're like a doctor who rather than trying to find out the cause of your illness, you're just being given pills to treat the symptoms. So it's like, oh I've got this pain in my side, here's a painkiller. That's not what I wanted. I want to know why I have a pain in my side. I don't want a painkiller. Um, although when I had the kidney stone, right as soon as I found out it was a kidney stone, I wanted all the painkillers they could give me. I I was like, get science in the room, I need more painkillers. But similarly, saying, well Tim you're a horrible boss, no one will ever want to work with you. I agree, there's people who don't want to work with me and probably some people on this channel who wouldn't want to work with me, and I wouldn't want to work with them. A lot of people do. That's missing the point. It's there there was a problem getting people involved in a way that I think is part of their job that they should be thinking, I'm I'm putting this feature in, is this going to connect right? Um, why do people, why why are we even needed this, no nobody asked me why we needed that, that AI. I suggested it was needed because designers were blocked on testing combat. They suggest I added, I thought was reasonable, 45 minutes of code connected in just two spots, two locations through events, an event system that already existed, no unit tests, no how would this be extended. This code was designed to be thrown out, it served a purpose. It, I could do a whole thing on rapid prototyping and maybe I will, but rapid prototyping just isn't a thing in the industry anymore, and it was hard to get people to understand I'm just trying to unblock something here really quickly, you will still be scheduled to do the real AI when it's really going to go in in a few more months, we just need the designers and level designers especially who are making encounters to be able to get a little better feel for how those encounters will go. But anyway, let's talk about a non-game example, maybe if I illustrated this with a non-game example it would make more sense. Let's say there was an intersection near your house, two streets intersected, and there are always accidents there. There cars are always running into each other there. Now a reasonable person might go okay, are there trees or hedges or other things blocking view there, maybe we need stop signs or stoplight, or maybe we need to replace it with roundabout. Those are reasonable discussions to the problem I just mentioned, people asking questions about what's what could be the cause of this and here are some possible solutions. Instead, how I see people talk about it is oh my goodness, they should ticket everybody who has an accident there, and if you have more than one accident, you just get your license removed, that'll fix it. Or they say why don't we just reduce the speed on those roads and all the nearby roads to like 10 miles per hour, then there probably won't be accidents because people can stop in time, and even if there are, no one will get hurt. Or they go, there's an accidents there and people are getting hurt a lot, we should build a hospital right on the corner, so then when people get hurt we can take them right into that hospital. And it's like, those all those suggestions, people think they're being reasonable and intelligent and this is I'm going to fix this problem of of accidents at this intersection, but they're looking at the wrong thing. They're either punishing the people for having the accidents or making it so that the accident still happen but the side effects aren't aren't as bad, either in damage or the accidents happened just as badly but you've got something there to fix the people. It breaks my programmer brain that people think those are suggestions, reasonable suggestions to there's an intersection with a lot of accidents, and that's how I feel like a lot of people are responding to my stories. They're not thinking about what's causing it, they're looking at the symptoms and going I can get rid of those symptoms, trivial. And to put it in another non-game development analogy, let me tell you what I what how I think of this channel, this whole channel, every topic, every time I I start and talk, this is what I'm thinking. I feel like I'm walking around a dark warehouse and I've got a flashlight and I'm pointing at things in the warehouse and I'm going, oh look there, that's a, see those

 boxes? I want people to see them. I want to be aware of what it is they're seeing, and then if it's an issue, maybe they can have some ideas of how to fix it. Now good suggestions would be hey, I didn't get a good perspective on those boxes, can you stand in a different place and illuminate them, perfectly reasonable answer. Or hey, I have some ideas of where you should go in the warehouse, some places that need the light shown, so we can talk about that thing, perfectly reasonable suggestions. Instead, I get comments like, well I get that, oh you're stupid, I get that, in worded in many different ways. Or buy a bigger flashlight, you loser, which I don't get why anybody would say that. Or we just turn off the flashlight, now where's there's no problems anymore. Um, people have basically suggested things of rather than fixing the problem, they're making the problem not visible anymore. And then some people even go, well you should just leave the warehouse, you should go to the Indie Warehouse next door, we don't have those problems. And I'm like, okay but can you not see that there's still a big warehouse with people bumping around in the dark and having problems? Going to the new warehouse doesn't fix the old warehouse. Um, I understand some of you are like, look, I didn't build this warehouse, I don't know how to fix the warehouse problems, I'm going to go over to the indie warehouse. I get it, but you know, I spent the last 40 years in that warehouse. I want to try to help fix some of these things or even better, point out them so you guys can fix them. Um, so in a sense, I kind of want the issues discussed so that people know what the issues are and agree with the issues are and then try to fix them. And that's the whole point of this kind of, you know, I want, in addition to me wanting you guys to go and make great games for me to play, which is a totally selfish reason, but I consider this channel a place for learning about game development topics and discussing them. And some topics include problems that exist in the game industry. What I'm hoping is that people will focus more on treating the causes of those problems and a lot less on just ameliorating the symptoms of those problems. And as I said in another video, about hey, we've all got to agree that there is a problem and what's the cause of the problem and then the solution of the problem, that's kind of what I'm saying here. I see a lot of discussion about game development caution, I don't see a lot of, a lot of suggestions on how to get rid of it. I see a lot of people saying, I don't think it's a problem, or they're being this way because of fear of their job or fear of speaking out. Okay, if that's the root cause of this, how do we fix that? And I don't think we fix that by firing people, because once you start going down that road, you end up with a lot of very quiet people who never want to rock the boat. Again, I still see game development caution as being a problem. I don't see it being solved with some of the solutions people are saying. In fact, most of those ignore the cause and are just going after symptoms. I think in the future, let's look more at causes. And that's kind of what this video is about. Anyway, thank you.

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim. Today, I want to talk about something that, for a lack of a better phrase, I'm going to call game development caution. Before I start and tell you three different stories, they're a little different, but then I'll tell you what I'm thinking about.

**Whiteboards**

When we made Fallout, towards the end, when we were really trying to get it out, we had two whiteboards. One whiteboard had a list of features or content that weren't done yet that really needed to get in, and the other whiteboard had a list of what the 10 most egregious bugs were, and next to each one of these on these two different whiteboards were listed the person who was assigned to it. We did it in a whiteboard like this so that people could come in the morning and look at it because this predated Jira or Confluence or anything like that. They could come in, look at the whiteboard, and go, "Oh, I see something I need to jump on." Worked fine. I don't think I heard any complaint about it; people liked getting stuff off of that. If they saw something, I was like, "I'm on that today." Try doing the exact same thing 10 years later at Carbine. Overwhelmingly, people said, "No, do not do that. I will quit if you do that. If I see my name on that whiteboard, I will quit." And I said, "Well, what if we don't put people's names next to it?" "I'll still quit; people will know it's me."

**Combat AI**

Story two. When we were making The Outer Worlds, I wanted to put in, this is probably a year, end of year two, so we're still a year away, the combat AI wasn't really in yet, so I asked for a very simple combat aggression code to be added. It was, this is how simple it was: every time an NPC got shot, they would see if that person was on the list of someone who'd shot them. If they weren't, they'd add them to the list, which they matter with the amount of damage they just took. If they were already on the list, they'd just add the amount of damage they took. Whenever they're deciding who to attack, they attack the person at the top of the list. That's it, that's all I wanted. Keep in mind, the advantage of that basic AI, you can make lots of changes later. You can make them that it has the one at the top of the list, if it's different than the person you're attacking, the damage has to exceed the damage of the person attacking you by a certain amount before your change targets. You can take distance into account, you can take whether you can reach them into account, whether you have a ranged weapon into account, all that comes later. That's all I wanted. Uh, it got put into the programmer production queue and came back with an estimate of four weeks. I pushed back, saying, the code I asked for was very simple. I've written it before, would take about 45 minutes. It's basically, there's already a callback when you get hit, that's when you look to put them on the list, and there's a call when you want to pick a target, that's when you look at the list and see which one you want to attack. That's it. The programmer who got signed to came to me and said, "I need four weeks," and I'm like, "Why? Walk me through what you're going to do." And he goes, "You don't understand." And I was like, "I've coded this three times, walk me through it," and he wouldn't. He left, he left angry. Lead programmer came back, started yelling at me, saying, "If he says he needs four weeks, he needs four weeks," and I'm like, "Then I will do it. I'll have it done before lunch." And he said, "No, because no one then people will have to support your code." I'm like, "Well, let me walk through. I'm going to walk you through what I want, and you tell me why this takes four weeks." He looked at what I wrote, which was about 10 lines of pseudo code on a whiteboard, and he goes, "I'll come back." He came back about an hour later and said, "What about two weeks?" And I said, "Do I have any options here?" "Fine, two weeks."

**Development Caution**

Story three. Leonard and I talk about features all the time, whether it's dialogues or system mechanics or story setting, we get very into it. Our voices may be raised, we're jumping out of our chairs to draw things on whiteboards, we're pacing back and forth. I know I've mentioned this before, but Anthony Davis showed up at our door and said, "You guys have to stop yelling, everybody's getting nervous, it's like Mom and Dad are yelling at each other." Still don't know who he met with Mom, but we explained that just us talking, we're not mad, but we're trying to tease apart exactly what to do, and we're getting into it.

So, what do those three stories have to do with each other? I'm starting to see in the industry, I shouldn't say starting, in the last decade, the last quarter of my career, I'm starting to see this rise of what I can only call development caution, an abundance of caution of padding estimates, uh, time estimates of wanting to go around and check with a lot of people to see if something's okay, asking, "Should we do this? I'm not sure, let's have a meeting." Frequently, people would want to have a meeting to discuss something, and those were the very people who would say, "We have too many meetings, I can't get any work done." Now, caution can be a really good thing if it leads to less bugs, less stress. Also, I get the fact that because games cost more now, your people are approaching it with this sense of caution because you're not just going to be out a little bit of money, you're going to be out a lot of money if this game doesn't do well. The thing that worries me, though, is games can also be a lot worse because of caution, and everybody who's cautious kind of denies that. They're like, "No, it'll, we're reducing bugs, we're in Pre increasing life work balance, people are less stressed," and I'm like, "True, but with but you're also taking a lot less risk in a game," which in many games, I think, give them less charm. And yeah, even games that have Jank, have a lot of charm. My games have had Jank, uh, I know people talk about Jank and other games, you know, things where the AI acts in a bizarre way in certain circumstances, or NPCs say weird things or do weird things. It can be charming.

But things have changed, and I know games have gone from being an expression of an idea of an of like artwork from a particular person or group of people into a corporate-driven money-seeking instrument, and I get

 it, there's a lot of money going into these. In a way, though, I would argue they always were. You always were making these with the idea that, you know, "I hope it sells a lot, we make money," but now designs are being driven by this. That's why we have microtransactions, it's why we have pre-orders, it's why we have what we're starting to see lately, where games are, if you pay a little more, you can play it a few days or even a week early. Now, you can't always get blame the the Publishers or the Developers for this. If people didn't pay for it, they wouldn't do it. It's like spam, if everybody stopped answering spam tomorrow, it would go away, but because a tiny percentage does, it's there for everybody to see. But so, I'm not really talking about the money-driven part. I'm talking about how the caution is dampening down the ideas. It's why I want to double down on this. I've always thought the Indie space is a lot richer in ideas, probably not money, certainly not money, but they're much richer in ideas because they take less, they have less caution, and take a lot more risk. And unfortunately, what I see then is, um, AAA's that dip into indie games for features and ideas. By the way, it's not just Publishers and developers that I see all this caution with. I've seen a huge rise in caution in game journalism. It's become the norm that no one, what no journalist wants to risk getting into an embargo situation where they're not given an early access code so they can't write their reviews earlier than other people. They're worried about not being invited to press events or, you know, junkets, I think they're called. So a lot of them have gone a lot more cautious in what they say. I really miss the reviews. I'll name a couple, like Scorpio in the 80s and 90s, at Desklock in the 90s and early 2000s because those two people, those two reviewers, said what they thought. If you put out a game, they secure you for all the things that were wrong with it, but then they praise you for everything that's right with it. Now, it's sort of like, well, we really like this, but they don't want to like really double down on it because it may be something people don't like. So like, let's say a journalist loves the diversity in the game, he may go, "Well, I'm not going to say that that much because I don't wanna come across as being pandering, and also, some people yell when you talk about that." So, I just see a lot of the passion drain out of game journalism, and they're really just trying to go for what can, what kind of review can I write that generates the most clicks. And I guess this worries me because if I see this everywhere, if I see this in Publishers and developers and now new people entering the industry, they don't have this passion anymore. So, you know, what's the moral of all this? I've got, I want to tell people, just go and make it, make what you want. You don't need a committee to sign off on it. You can always go back and change it, or if you make something, and it turns out not to be good at all and unsalvageable, throw it away. But that, that rapid iteration to get to some really good idea is a lot better than just being so cautious that you basically creep up to a very mundane game that doesn't show any kind of passion in its development. People can tell, people can tell.

So, I started with stories, let me end with those three stories and how they kind of got resolved. So, I didn't even try to do the Whiteboard solution when I made our worlds. What I did is I made my own Confluence page called like I was Tim Kaine's top 10 or something. It was in my Confluence space, and I wrote, "Here are the 10 biggest things I once looked at this week." And there were a few producers who would look at that page all the time. What was great about this solution, nobody could come and complain to me about it because it was in my Confluence space, my own personal but public Confluence space. Also, I'd like to point out that anybody could go to Jira at any time and say, "What are the 10 most highly prioritized bugs and who are they assigned to?" So, we already had that whiteboard, virtually. But somehow, it was okay that it wasn't called attention to. For the combat aggression code, I think I settled on two weeks, and I think it got done faster than that, great. I got it. I don't think I asked for anything after that. I didn't go and specifically ask for anything because I realized that I was being viewed as some sort of ogre when I knew something could be done faster, and there was no solution to it, which is why years ago, I started thinking, oh, this is becoming a problem. Same thing with Leonard not yelling at each other, we just kept doing it. We're like, "It's our office, we shut the door, we're not mad at each other, but this is the way we get things done." Note that people know some people don't like it, we won't get things done like that with you. And let me tell you, I think there were people who felt like they missed out on not being parts of those conversations. Some people would come over, uh, Charlie, um, had his office right next door, and he was the lead designer on Outer Worlds, and he would come in sometimes and join in, great. Other people didn't do that, you missed out, and I think you missed out on some really fun, active, engaging conversations about game development. But that's the way things are going, so I'm not sure I have a great solution, other than telling people, reminding people to be passionate. But I just kind of want to talk about this because it kind of ties into bigger teams and longer development time, bigger budgets, just this whole game development caution that's rising up in the industry. So, there, got that off my chest.

Game Development Then vs Now.md

https://youtu.be/orfxWkc9t-4?si=5Xi2TkLyM8nmAFnp

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim. Today I want to answer a question from Jeremy Mason 9802, who asks, "Do you think game development is harder or worse nowadays compared to say the 90s, or is it better or the same?" Here's how I'm going to answer that, because I think that is a very nuanced question that needs a nuanced answer. So here's what I'm going to do: I'm going to tell you some things that I think are better, I'm going to tell you some things that I think are worse, and I'm going to tell you some things that go either way, mainly because depending on you, you may think it's a better thing, you may think it's a worse thing, or you may not even care about that thing. So let me tell you, let me start with what I think is better, and also I think it's funny that you said the 90s since I started in 1981, the whole decade there, uh, the 80s, where it was crazy, and factors into the first thing I'm going to say.

So here are the ways I think the game history is now better: it is now much, much, much easier to learn how to make games. There are YouTube tutorials explaining how to do it, there are multiple game engines available for free, there are classes online, there are classes at universities, there are classes in high schools, actually there's a class in junior high school that I know about. So, so much easier to learn how to do game development, it's not even funny. So those of you who try to use as an excuse, "Oh, it's so hard to do game development," you have no idea how hard it was. I, on the Atari 800, which is what I first learned on, there was almost nothing available. I had to learn BASIC from other books and then figure out what was different about Atari BASIC. I had to go through memory maps and technical schematics to figure out where interrupts were mapped to memory location so I can poke them. Sometimes I didn't know what value to use, so I just poked them with different values and saw what happened. That's how you did things in the 80s.

Now, it's not only easier to learn how to do it, it's a little easier, I think, to get started doing it, not getting a job, I'll talk about that later, but just to get started. You can download a game engine, you can download free assets for it, and not just art assets, you can get scripts and code and sounds. You could have a game up and running in minutes or hours, where in the 80s, you would have to spend months before you'd even begin to see the tiniest of games show up on your machine.

So that's the first way I think things have gotten better. Second way I think things have gotten better is pay is better. I know a lot of people are going, "No, it's not, it still pays badly." It pays better than it did in the 80s and the 90s, way better. I've already told the story, so I'm not going to repeat it, where when I tried to apply for a mortgage in '95, the mortgage dealer literally was in shock at how little I was being paid. Next key said compared to people who have master's degrees in computer science and are doing programming at companies within two blocks of where you work, you are dramatically underpaid and you qualify for no loan through any lender I represent, and I was like... So it pays better now. Housing is worse, but base pay, even adjusted for inflation, is way better now.

Related to that, hours are better. Many, many people worked many, many hours more than eight in the 80s and 90s, and even into the early 2000s. Part of it was passion, part of it was necessity. There was just no way to get games finished without crunch. Management was, uh, games were in their early form, people didn't understand the phases you needed to do, they didn't understand games as art, they didn't understand what things could be managed and what things needed to be just boxed time-boxed and say, "Let's see how much we can get done in this amount of time." Things could get really bad. Things weren't identified as being critical path or needing fallbacks in case their designer implementation failed. We've gotten better at that, and because of that, hours have gotten better. It also has helped that years ago, things like EA Spouse blogged about how bad crunch was at Electronic Arts and helped them get the ball rolling on getting things better. So hours are better. Could they be better still? Yes, but they were way better than they were.

And then finally, the fact that there are specialists now in the game industry helps so much. Back in the 80s and 90s, you had to be a jack of all trades. I had to know how to do graphics, yes, a colorblind programmer had to learn how to do graphics. I didn't know how to do sound. I had to know how to do, um, I drop my own installers for the games because there's no generalized installer, so we had to write an installer for each game we wrote. You had to know how lots of different hardware, not just video hardware, CD-ROMs all worked differently, um, you had to learn how to do error handling. All of this, networking. Now, they're specialists. There are people like, "All I do is graphics. All I do is networking." It is so much better having people who know and study those things.

So those are, that's the four ways I think things have gotten better. So now, let me tell you about a few ways I think things have gotten worse. Um, this is all my opinion, but you asked. There are less original ideas floating around now. Now, let me put that in a bunch of conditionals. When we started in the 80s and 90s, well, especially in the 80s, there were very few video games, almost no PC games, so almost anything you did was original, whether it was a good idea or a bad idea, it was original. By the time you get into the 90s, and certainly starting in the 2000s, people would have ideas, and these had been done before. Often they didn't know, people didn't bother to play older games, so they had no idea they were reinventing a wheel, and sometimes that meant they let, they went into the exact same pitfalls the game that had that idea had. Sometimes they had, they knew about it, and they said, "Well, I have a new idea with a twist." So sometimes you saw an original idea, but it was an old idea with a little twist to it. Original ideas still occurred, but I remember even in the late 90s telling people I worked with in the video game business that I was seeing more original ideas in tabletop. I mean, that's why I got the ideas for fate points and Arcanum, um, flaws in Outer Worlds. There were just a lot of really cool ideas going on in tabletop.

Related to this is discovery. It is much, much

, much harder now, having your game be discovered by players. There are so many games coming out, Steam is overloaded, the App Store on iPhones is overloaded, Epic has a lot of games in it, um, when you, if you still get ads online, I mean, I've put up as many blockers as I can and pay for streaming services, I can't remember the last time I saw an ad, but getting people to even know your game's out is hard. It's why YouTube influencers and Twitch players and, you know, Let's Play and having streamers play your game is now a way to get people to know your game is even coming out. A lot, even conventions are starting to die off, I mean, E3, it's just, it's hard to be discovered, and indies, I think, feel that pain harder than anyone because you may make a really good game, by the way, they got a lot of original ideas going on there, but getting people to learn that your game is out and has this cool idea is really hard.

Which gets me into marketing. I've said, and this is a thread and subthread on previous videos, some of the issues I've had with marketing in the past, like demanding demos, demanding features. Well, marketing design really got in bed together in the last 10 or 15 years. I remember going to meetings and hearing terms now, I know I use a lot of terms, I throw out RPG and MMO and all this to the point where, when I was dating an architect, he's like, "I can't understand half of what you say about games." But I would go to game development meetings, and I'd hear people saying ARPU and COGs and DAUs and MAUs and IPs, and I'm like, uh, I knew what some of them were, but they were, they were actually throwing these out as if they were relevant to game design. They are related to game design, but like, these are people who wanted me to change my game design to support ARPU, average revenue per paying user, CoG, cost of goods, "Do you really need that manual?" DAU versus MAU, daily average user, monthly average user, IAPs, in-app purchases, which you all know as microtransactions. What started back with that horse armor has grown into an entire industry financial support pillar. So, I don't think this is a good thing. It is not supporting design for good design, it's supporting design to make money. So, for the same reason I think player agency is good, but player addiction is not, this intrusion of marketing into game design is not a good thing. Will it make money? Yes, because many of you will spend money on things like this. I wish, and I've said this in many of my videos, I wish people would vote more with their wallet. If a game comes out that you don't like, and you can, if there's not a demo, watch one of the, you know, streamers play it. If you don't think you're like it, don't play it, don't buy it. Certainly, I never advocate doing, uh, early purchase because just wait for it to come out. It'll cost the same.

So, let me talk about some other things, though, that aren't better or worse, you could, I could go either way on this. Getting a job. I've seen people argue that it was harder back then, I've seen people argue that it's harder now. Let me tell you my impression of what's going on. Back then, there were way fewer game jobs to be had, but there were also way fewer people going for them, so anything that made you stand out, "Oh, you have a degree in programming. Oh, you've already made a game. Um, oh, you have written some software that's really appropriate to what we're the game we're making, come on, all come on in." Now, you can learn game development much easier, that was one of my first points, however, you compete against a lot more people. So often, people tell me how to get a job, that's when I say you should have a demo, because other people will, and that will make them go to the top of the heap, won't necessarily get them hired, but it will certainly get them considered before you if you don't have a demo. So, basically, back then, there were fewer jobs to be had, and that's why it was hard to get a job, now there are a lot more jobs, but there's a lot more people looking for. I did an entire video on team size getting bigger, so I'm not gonna repeat all of those, but let me just say, the bigger teams, there are a lot of great things you get from bigger teams, and there's a lot of bad things you get from bigger teams, so this is going to be a taste choice for you. Do you care about how big teams have gotten? If you do, you may want to look for companies that may either make smaller scope games or go indie.

And then finally, the third thing that's kind of related to that is much longer development time. I've made a game, my shortest game was Bard's Tale, which only took a few months. Temple only took 18-20 months, but then I worked on WildStar, the MMO, for six years, and it didn't ship for another three years after I left, so there are some games that just take really long development. This can be a great thing, you make bigger games with more features, it can be a bad thing too, you might burn out. There's more turnover, so you'll be working with different people, and maybe you're like them, and maybe you won't, but also, it puts a big gap in your resume. I went from not having a game since 2004 with Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines until 2014 with South Park: The Stick of Truth. That's a 10-year gap in a 42-year development career. That 10-year gap is big, and I have to explain it as I lost six years at Carbine, and then went to a new studio where that game was supposed to come out in six months, and it took another three years. So longer development, pro or con, depending on how you look at it.

So, what would I say overall? Wow, I'm going on a long time. What would I say overall? Overall, I think things are better now than they were 20 or 30 years ago, but from what I've said, I think it's going to depend on you, what role you want in game development, and what you want to get out of it. You can certainly find a satisfying job at a big company, you almost certainly be one of many, many, many people working. I've heard people say, "Well, I feel like a cog in a machine here." Okay, go indie, oh, but then you might lose insurance or guaranteed employment, or it might be contractual. So, with the pro-con thing, it depends on what you're looking for, but let me tell you, now, these days, you have options. In the 80s, there were no options, you took what the

 industry offered, or you went and did something else, and a lot of people I know went and did something else. I have a whole video too on why I was stubborn and didn't go do anything else. So anyway, I hope, Jeremy Mason, that answers your question on do I think game dev is better now or back.

Game Development Time.md

https://youtu.be/7hGE18GGDj8?si=nFt8tNuvgolHSTZc

Hi everyone, it's me Tim, and today I want to talk about game development time. I've gotten a lot of questions from a lot of people; this is maybe the most commonly asked question, at least in the last few weeks, because I've gotten at least, I don't know, four or five of these.

Geomancer HT asks, "Please talk about the 'it's ready when it's done' and a delayed game is eventually good."

Tetramir 1 asks, "Talking about a length of development would be interesting subject because teams have gotten bigger, but games take longer too."

Yeti Catcher 1780 asked, "Do you think games coming out under shorter deadlines means only the best things get put in the game, so it's better, or do you think it's always better for them to have huge development cycles?"

And our own Bite Your Own Teeth asked, "Here's another one: when to cut, when to polish, what to look out for when a feature won't make the cut, how do you get it past the finish line?"

These are pretty much a lot of questions about Dev time, deciding how to cut. I've touched upon this a little bit in past videos where I talk about making your design pillars and deciding what matches them and what doesn't. In my recent video, I mentioned I've made a game as quickly as 14 weeks for Bard's Tale Construction Set, which is what, that's not even three months, no it's a little over three months, it's not even four months. I've also talked about WildStar taking nine years.

I think a reasonable development time is somewhere within that limit, but let me talk about first, I'll do this as I like to do a lot, let's talk about the pros of a long development time and the cons of a long development time.

So, long development time has a lot of obvious pros. First of all, it lets you add a lot of features and content that you otherwise would not have had time to do. Some features just take a long time to do right. I've said this is why I don't put romance options in my games. Personally, I'm not that into them, but I put a lot of stuff in my games I'm not that into. I'm not really into always pure fighter, kill everything paths, but I still do that. The thing is, I think to get romance options done right, you really have to spend a lot of time on them, which really absorbs a lot of narrative designer's time that could have been spent doing other things. And I played a lot of games with romance options that feel like bizarre slot machines like, I said the right thing, I had the right item, oh good, now the person's gonna sleep with me. It's just a strange thing, it's like, if that's your thing, go and play dating sims. There's a whole genre of games available that do romance a lot better than I see in a lot of RPGs.

But just in terms of content, if you have a long development time, you don't have to cut as much stuff. I've talked about having to cut things not because I thought they were bad for the game. Sometimes you cut things because you realize this doesn't work with other features or this thing really isn't something that belongs in this game, but sometimes you cut things just because this will take a long time to do. I've mentioned how big Monarch was supposed to be in Outer Worlds, and I do regret that it got cut. It was the one place in the world that was supposed to be big and exploratory and really make it feel like there's this second planet out there that's lawless and huge and just has all this stuff tucked away in it, and we lost a lot of that when it got cut. So you don't have to do that when you have a long development time. It makes the world not only feel bigger but it makes it feel more realized. There's a lot of stuff to explore, people to find, they don't all feel like they're on the main story quest, which I really like. That's why I like side quests, because it doesn't make it feel like everybody you run into is somehow involved in this main storyline that you're trying to tell. There's a lot of other people just trying to live their lives in this world, and yeah, they may have side quests for you to do, but some of them don't, they're just there to run their shop or farm or do whatever it is they're doing, and they don't have anything to do with you. They're just there.

And finally, a long development time lets you debug. I think I've mentioned this, especially for the Troika games, Leonard and I sometimes joke that every single Troika game shipped as an alpha. Arcanum certainly did. Right after we got everything put in, all the features we wanted, and some we probably should have cut, and we got them effectively debugged. I mean, you may think Arcanum was buggy, but there were a lot of crash bugs. We were about to start a bounce pass when everything was locked, and the game is shipped. Very similar thing happened with Temple, and Temple, remember, Temple was done in, it was originally scheduled for 18 months, and we did it in 20. That's a short period of time to do an entire D&D three and a half rule set with every class. You know, I tried cutting things, they said no. But what happened was when we got to the end, and we're like, okay, now we're going to debug, hopefully they'll give us another month or two, nope, shipped. And then with Vampire, I don't have to say, it shipped even before it was finished. I mean, that's why the Warrens at the end of the game are just completely empty.

So those are all advantages that a longer development time would have had, but let's talk about some of the bad things a long development time will cause. Sometimes, a big bag of features isn't a good thing. Having a game, there's too much of a good thing, is a valid thing in game development. Sometimes you have features that are individually good, but they just don't belong together. I've mentioned this multiple times, that we cut things out of Fallout that I weren't saying were bad. Maybe some people would like talking raccoons, maybe some people would have liked endoskeleton robots or a liquid metal robot. I'm just saying those didn't belong in the concept we had for Fallout, so they got cut. They didn't get cut for time reasons, they got cut because I didn't think they belonged.

A danger of having a long development time is, one of the ways you can cut a feature without insulting the designer of that feature too much is saying you literally don't have time. When you have a long development time, you lose that argument. So having to say something subjective like, I don't like it, that doesn't fly with a lot of designers. Now, I firmly believe that that's something the game director can do. I had ideas for pillars that Josh didn't put in. I thought they were good, but it's his game, he can say, I don't like that, or I don't want to do that, and that

's fine. I did that on my games, and sometimes it led to lengthy arguments with those designers.

So, another bad thing that comes with long development time is just coordinating all that work. Long development time usually means bigger game, more complex game, more feature set game, and that requires a lot of coordination. How are those things working together? Are there unintended emergent side effects? Do you like them? Are they fun? Do you need to get rid of them? Having production ride herd over instead of a few dozen features, a few hundred features, that's a lot of work. That's a lot of work, and you're expecting a lot out of them, and sometimes they're up to the task, and sometimes they're not.

Another problem with the long development time is hardware changes. It's very hard to target your end machine when you're planning to have an eight-year development cycle. That, I mean, consoles only have 10-year lifetimes. Are you making a game that you're targeting the next console? You have no idea what that hardware is going to be, or are you making a game and you're hoping that Nvidia or AMD are going to have a really amazing video card that can run your game, and you're targeting something that doesn't exist yet? That's a risk. It's a huge danger, but with a long development time, you're probably going to target some things that, at the time you're developing them, hardly any video card, of any video card, could handle, and sometimes you're planning on faster hard drives and bigger RAM on your PC as well. All issues you have to deal with and guess.

There's some other issues, like team changes. If you have an eight-year project, I guarantee not everyone's going to stick around for that. People don't like eight-year holes in their resume. I have a 10-year gap in my resume from Bloodlines in 2004 to South Park in 2014. I don't like that. And it's because WildStar took so long, it absorbed six years of my time, and then still didn't come out until after South Park.

So, you have to deal with more team rollover, the longer your project lasts. There's also something called that I call team relaxation that happens on long projects. I'm sure you've all had people you knew in high school or college, and maybe it was you, who didn't really work hard until they were close to the deadline. You know, the person, first week in class, you're assigned a paper or project, and they don't do anything for the first 80% of the class, and then those people pull a lot of all-nighters in the last few weeks. I saw that in engineering, my engineering school, all the time. And those people were quick to blame the teacher, "He gave us too much, this assignment is too hard," and meanwhile, a lot of people who started the first week are like, "What are you talking about? We're done."

So, there's a tendency for employees who relax to blame the teacher, their employer, the publisher, "I didn't have enough time." But, by the way, before I, you go, "Oh, you're blaming the employees again," I see this happening at company levels all the time. I see a lot of companies that I've worked with and some that I haven't, who are a little too relaxed without a publisher driving them. Maybe their design pillars are really loose, or they put in way too many features than they should, maybe I did that with Arcanum. When you have a publisher writing you and saying, "Hey, this is what the contract was for, hey, you're supposed to be at this stage in the milestones," some employers and some developers just do better with having someone be the adult in the room and say, "Hey, you're supposed to be doing this stuff."

So, let me give you an example that's somewhat personal to me, that I'm just, I have a little bit of worry about, and I know this is going to get published because people are like, always bag on Fallout. What worries me about the current Fallout is, I was reading that now that Bethesda's finishing Starfield, they're going to start an Elder Scrolls next, so Fallout 5 will be pushed out to sometime after that. Well, assuming that each one of those is going to take five, maybe six years, that means the earliest we're going to see Fallout 5 is in 2034. That's almost 20 years after Fallout 4. 20 years, and it's 40 years since I started making the first Fallout. That is a long time. That's decades, that's generations. 40 years is almost two generations. There are going to be people playing Fallout 5 who may not have ever played Fallout 4, who can't even play Fallout 1, maybe it's just not playable anymore. There are going to be people playing Fallout 5, who their entire concept of Fallout is going to be whatever this Amazon TV show is. That worries me a little bit. I do wish Bethesda could bifurcate their teams and work on multiple things at once, but I also totally understand why they don't. They do really well when they focus on one thing. I've caught it, I've heard it at different companies called the eye of Sauron, that you have a few people who work on the project who are really good at writing that project and keeping the herd in check. So, I totally get why they do it. I'm just concerned that as project lengths have extended, I don't know how much longer this can happen, because it basically means that a franchise is in danger of, aging is the wrong word, becoming archaic. I mean, there are people who are going to look at Fallout 5 and go, "Wow, this franchise started 40 years ago. Whoa, my dad played this, my grandfather played this." I'm not ready for those kinds of comments about Fallout, but it looks like what's going to happen.

So, I guess to sum up, I understand all the pros of having a long development time. I've put out some very objective cons of having a long development time, but also just a subjective fear I have of that, if game companies start taking a long time to make gains, it's really going to make those franchises seem dated, because they literally will be dated. Anyway, I hope this answers all the questions I got from all the people about game development time.
Title: 
Game Difficulty Settings

Youtube Link:
https://youtu.be/wUI6LZaCKCg?si=LIMyfU5ZgHK9V8Ka

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim, and today I want to talk about game difficulty, specifically. I got a question from Noah Calder 4279 who asks:

> "I'd love if you could share your thoughts on difficulty in RPGs. Do you think customizable difficulties such as settings and sliders work well in RPGs? Which are the best methods of making RPGs difficult, and should RPGs get easier or more difficult the further a player advances through the game?"

That is a set of good questions that all fall under game difficulty, so I thought, okay, time to do a game difficulty video.

So, just up front, I do like customizable difficulty settings. I think anything that makes a player turn the game into something they'd like more, I'm not against. Frequently in my career, I've had arguments with people, designers, programmers, who think that every time you put an option in a game, it's because you couldn't make a decision. And I see where they're coming from. There were sometimes I couldn't decide what was better, and I thought maybe I'll make an option and you can flip back and forth between these two. But their argument, and I see their argument, is also it's hard to make your game good when you get to the balancing fun stage because you have to balance it against all these possible options that the player may set. However, I also view it as an accessibility thing. Like I said, I have a friend who likes to play games because he's a level designer, and he always sets the games' difficulty to easy because what he wants to do is see the game, not necessarily get stuck on a particularly difficult combat encounter. And I agree with that, that's a perfectly valid way of playing the game.

So that's how I view game difficulty sliders. It's something that people want to adjust to their level of personal, you know, comfort playing the game.

Now, there's a whole bunch of ways you can make the game more difficult. Ult... um, I have an entire video on enemy progression and how I like to do it, so you may want to go watch that, I'll put a link below. But one thing you can do to make a game harder when you set it to be "I want this game to be more difficult" is whatever your algorithm is for that enemy progression, which is probably based on the level of the player, just push it up a little. Maybe when an a combat encounter occurs, you pass in the player's level plus five if you're playing on a hard difficulty, or maybe the player's level minus three if you're playing on an easy difficulty. If you really want to make like a super hard level, you could pass in the player's level times two because then the game would start off just a little bit harder than it would normally be at level one and two, but it would quickly become much more difficult, which is what some people want. So that is one way you can do it, um, and that's an easy way if, if you do enemy progression the way I suggested, that's a pretty easy way to implement a game difficulty slider.

Another thing you could do is numerical changes. Those are the easiest things, like the player has less hit points, or the monsters have more, the player has slower health regeneration, or maybe they don't have any health regeneration in combat, or maybe they don't have any health regeneration outside of combat, maybe you have to sleep, uh, rest somewhere to get your health back, and rest requires, you know, food and camp supplies, or you can only do it in a particular place, or maybe you can only do it someplace like an inn, where you pay for. So now, health regeneration is gated behind something, which makes the player really question, "Can I keep going forward with the health I'm at now?" It makes the game harder.

You can also, as a purely numerical thing, say every skill check in the game on hard mode is a little harder. So, I talk about at one point where you set skill checks as a, um, instead of having everyone who puts a skill check in saying "I'm checking against 70" or "I'm checking against 80," they mark skill checks say "This is an easy check, this is a medium check, this is a hard check, this is a very hard check," which then transfers via a table to how difficult the skill checks are going to be tested actually in the game. I said you could do that in order to, when you get to the final balancing phase, you may want to adjust. Maybe a medium check isn't checking against 50, maybe it's checking against 60. You can do that, that, that's one reason that table exists, but you can also make a separate table for separate game difficulties. So a hard check in easy mode might be 50, in normal mode might be 75, in hard mode might be 85, and in difficult mode might be 95. So that's a good way of making combat difficulties with no code changes whatsoever.

So there's also a lot of non-numerical things you can do that make a game more difficult. You can add food, the, the requirement to eat food, to drink water, and to sleep, um, that only occur when you're playing in harder difficulties. We did that in The Outer Worlds. You got hungry, you got thirsty, you got tired, and you had to do those things, and those things cost resources, cost money, so the game is that much more difficult because of that.

You also can do things like, let's get rid of fast travel. You have to walk everywhere. In Outer Worlds, we said you can only fast travel back to the ship. So if you wanted to ever stop for the day, you could just fast travel back to the ship, but that was the only valid fast travel location. In Supernova difficulty, you, when you left the ship, you had to walk wherever you wanted to go, which took time, meant you had to go through encounters again, makes the game that much more difficult.

Now, some people are going, well, this just makes the game more, it adds friction. Almost any difficulty that, that you can imagine that's harder is friction to some people, while it's difficulty to others, um, so that's going to be true for all of these. So if that's, if that's your, um, argument against doing these, I don't really have a defense because it's true for everything you're going to do.

Now, many RPGs, mine included, only had difficulty sliders for combat, even though there are other ways of playing the game: stealth, dialogue, those are really common other play ways of playing the game. Now, a lot of those, say, those get more difficult with higher, um, difficulties setting by just making the skill checks higher, which is what I talked about. You know, you can say these skill checks are higher based on the difficulty mode, but there are other things you can do.

You could say for stealth in more difficult settings, that the detection radius for being seen by enemies is bigger, or the, when you're being VI viewed, the detection rate, in other words, somebody sees you and some bar goes like this, and when it hits the bottom, they've seen you, and they come

 after you, that, that falls down. The rate at which it collapses is faster at higher difficulty levels. You can do that.

Similarly, with dialogue, in addition to skill checks, you could just say whatever you need to have a successful dialogue statement, remember, I've talked about maybe, M dialogue should involve getting evidence for things. We did that in Fallout. You couldn't just walk up to the master and say all of the mutants are sterile, you had to prove it, and you had to prove it by talking to a Brotherhood of Steel scientist named V and getting a hollow disk of that data, of that evidence.

So one thing you could do is you could say evidence that you need to support dialogue statements in conversations are harder to reach. Maybe you can mark some of the evidence, and it moves to a location that's more difficult, or it moves to, or if it's in a container, the lock on that container becomes more difficult, or if it's somebody that you have to talk to, maybe they move to a more difficult place, or maybe there's an alternate person who is farther into an area, maybe you have to do quests to reach that person, maybe you have to talk to more people or sneak past people, that person is just harder to reach for some reason. These require more work, but once you set them up, then they just automatically change when you change the difficulty settings. So those, those things you can do to make the game more difficult, not just in combat.

And then, finally, there are some things you can do that are neither numerical or non-numerical. I, I consider them less handholding, and these are things you can literally revert to how games used to be when they were harder. Some people will never want this. They view it as we gave up, we stopped doing these in older games for a reason, but other people miss it.

These include things like when you get a quest, there is no quest marker. The person will tell you where to go or tell you roughly where to go. "I think the bandit's hidden up in a cave up north," but you have to go find it. You don't get a marker on your map saying, "Well, there's the cave with the bandits in it." Maybe you don't have maps. There were a lot of older games that didn't have maps. They might have had a world map, but no local map. They might have had a town map, but no dungeon map. Some didn't have maps at all. Those are something that came later. People like making maps themselves or writing down what they needed to do. It's basically less handholding for the player and makes the game more difficult.

You could also get rid of the quest log if you really wanted to go hardcore. You could say you have no quest log. If someone tells you to do something, you got to remember what they told you to do and what they want you to get and who it is who asked and where they're located, because that makes the game, some people argue, it makes the game far more immersive. It's a trivial thing to implement. You can say on super difficult, hard difficulty, quest log doesn't exist. You hit L for log, and nothing happens. So it can be done, but for all of these, the reason I recommend making it an option is that goes too far for some people. That's too much friction, even though you're making the game more difficult, and they say they want the game more difficult. For some people, difficulty and annoyance, they separate that out, and that may be too annoying.

So the question about what is the best way to do this, it's hard to answer. It really depends on your game, depends on what you're trying to make, what kind of game you're making, what, what difficulty factor you're trying to hit, what options you want to open up to the players, what you don't, um, what you have time to code, what you don't. So I would say of all the things I just mentioned on how to make a game more difficult, you're going to have to decide for yourself which ones you can use.

And then for the final question about should RPGs get easier or harder as you play them, I have a trick. It's a trick question because I have a trick answer. They should get both easier and harder as you play because as you play through the game and you get higher level, you want to feel more powerful. You want to be able to stomp on some things. That's why I don't like level scaling. Places you've been before, before that you that were a little difficult for you to get through, should be easier when you go through on a higher level. Things you run into before, like maybe those bandits down by the bridge that you that would always stomp you when you were lower level, it's fun to go back when you're higher level and stomp them.

However, if everything just gets easier as you go up a level, the game just gets easier and easier until finally the end, you have the common complaint of "nothing is challenging, I have tons of money and nothing to spend it on." So I think new places in the game should become harder. That's why I talked about why I don't like general enemy scaling. I do like making it so when you enter into an area, that area's level is set to your current level, so as this new as your player character gets higher level, when he goes into new places, he finds challenges there, but when he goes to old places, he finds them easier because he's more powerful.

So that's kind of my answer to that. It's kind of, I hope you don't think it's ducking the question because I do think it's a good question, but the answer isn't that RPGs should become easier or harder; it's they get easier in some places and harder in others.

So, I think that's all my thoughts on game difficulty, many of which I did in my games, some of which I never did but I wished I had. And so, I hope that answers your question, Noah Calder 4279.
Title:
Game Economy.md
Youtube Link:
https://youtu.be/ne9IIn7nEV4?si=WRlRPGnqi7BAaATj

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim, and today I want to talk about game economy. This is partially based on the video I did on equipment durability, but specifically because a YouTube commenter, anen filipovic 2851, asks, "Money imbalance is a huge deal. Having lots of money like Scrooge McDuck after 30% of gameplay makes game super easy, even on the hardest difficulty. So, I do not get how this is not super important to fix before shipment." So that made me want to talk about game economy and how hard it is. I could lecture; this could be a whole college course. I mean, you've taken economy, game economy is equally difficult. I could teach for a whole quarter, have whiteboards, and materials to pass out. So what I'm going to do is give a very big overview right now of game economy and what knobs exist to be twisted.

But let me answer how I answered anen in the comments. Basically, there are three reasons money imbalance doesn't get fixed on The Outer Worlds or in Arcanum, in Fallout, in almost any RPG I've ever played, probably every RPG I've ever played. And I think those three reasons boil down to this: one, you have to basically do economy late in the game because all the other systems that go into economy have to be done, just like optimization. If you try to do a balance pass on economy too early in game development, you're just opening yourself up to a world of hurt. But by the time economy is something you should be looking at, this is the part of the game where bugs, like crash bugs and bugs that prevent the player with a particular character build from reaching the end of the game, that's where those bugs take priority. So those are always going to be done before economy.

The second reason, fixing a money imbalance often means changing other systems. And I'll talk about sources and sinks, but until you have all these systems like vendors, and loot drops, and quest rewards, and crafting, and all those factor into the economy. To balance the economy often means changing one or more of those systems, and there may not be time to do all those, especially to make those changes and then test them. So often, because those systems, in a vacuum, work frequently, it's like, we're just going to leave those alone. And yes, the player is going to end the game with a lot of money.

And then third, it's a very complex issue. Not only do the developers working on a game may not agree on what things to change, what you may change may depend on what the player's build is. Depending on their class or what skills they picked, parts of the economy may hit them harder than others. And I'll talk about that. But what this means is sometimes the changes that you have to do in the step two I just mentioned, they don't work, and they just shift the cause of the money imbalance onto something else.

So for those three reasons, you often see games, RPGs made, and you finish the game with a lot of money, and you always go, why didn't they fix that? It's really hard to fix.

So let's talk about game economy as a whole and why it gets so complex. And this is, like I said, this is the part of me talking where I could give lectures on game economy, and I don't even think I'm good at game economy, and I've been working on this problem for 25, 30 years. It's a tough problem. It's like real-life economy. Most governments, most countries have not figured this out. So don't feel bad if you go, this is really complicated. I don't know why this is, you know, why no one's figured this out. No one's figured it out, not just game developers.

So I view economies in games, and I've mentioned this in other videos, like sources and sinks. Some people call it tap and sink, but that always confuses me because it mixes metaphors. Shouldn't it be tap and drain? But I use source and sink. Source is, you can view those, and a few other things, as the complete element of the economy. Sources are where you get things, not just money. It's where player wealth comes from. It can be things they find in the environment, things they find on the ground, things they find in chests and dungeons, things they harvest off plants, or anything like you can mine minerals. There are also drops, which is anything that you killed to get the item, whether you killed them, and they had it in their inventory, or you killed them, and then you could use one of your abilities, like if you kill an animal, and you can skin it to get a hide. I consider those drops. And then quests can provide items and money, so can vendors, so can crafting systems. So right there, found, drops, quests, vendors, crafting, those are the five what I consider to be the five major sources of player wealth. By the way, I use those sources of player wealth for when I try to do balancing in a game on where the best items are going to come from. This is tangential to economy. This is where you're making a game, you're like, I want to know when a particular item should be made available to the player. Usually, this is done by player level and item type. So imagine you have a spreadsheet with player level bands over here, like 1 through 5, 5 through 10, 10 through 15, and across the top are item types like chest piece, helmet, weapon, pants, shoes, gloves. You can break magic item types into there if you want to, potions, wands, whatever you have in your game. This is where all the types would be. So now you have all, now you have the types and the player levels, and in those cells, for every one of those cells, you list one of those sources I just mentioned. So maybe for player level 1 to 5, the best chest armor comes from things they find in the world, in ground, on the ground, in the chests are harvested. Maybe the best weapons for level 1 to 5 come from creature drops. Maybe the best helmets come from vendors. By the way, sometimes I add an extra type of drop, which is boss drop, which adds an extra source because in these kinds of charts, I like to distinguish drops off regular creatures and then drops off bosses because you may want to say the best gloves at this level get dropped off a boss. So they're not something that just happens as you're running around the world; they drop off a boss. If you really want to get crazy, or you want to hire a full-time designer, and this is nothing what he does, into that, instead of a 2D graph, you would add a third dimension. So a 3D cell set of cells because the extra one is class. So that way, you can say the best weapon for your wizard class at level 1 to 5 comes from crafting, but the best weapon for your fighter class at level 1 to 5 comes from a boss drop. There are games that make that distinction, and there's reasons to do that. Seriously, that could be a whole class.

So

 those are our sources, our basic sources, and stuff you would do with them besides economy. So let's talk about the sinks. Sinks are anything that take wealth away from the player. This includes vendors. Notice I included vendors as a source, and that's not contradictory. Vendors can be where you get stuff, and they can also be where you sell stuff. Some games are entirely built around that. If you ever played Elite, you found places where a vendor sold something cheaper than where another vendor bought something, and then you just ran back and forth between those two, so you made that a money source, that run was a money source. But vendors can also be sinks because if you need ammo, food, water, healing supplies, or whatever, you get those from vendors, and that's where your money goes. And then you get these items, which are consumables, and disappear from the world, so that's a sink. Smiths can be a sink if your world includes repairing. Healers are a sink if your world has places you go to get your health restored, or if you get conditions applied to you or status effects that you need a priest or wizard to remove from you, those are sinks. Trainers are sinks in a lot of games. Those are places you go where you pay to spend your skill points. A lot of games had trainers for a lot. I think Might and Magic did it. We did something similar in Arcanum, where your rank went up, but then your training was something you had to pay for, and that was an orthogonal thing that added to your skills. Some games make you pay to rest or camp, and that's the only way you could get back spells. Pillars did this. Rent, a lot of games charge rent, either you have your own house, and it's rent, or Ultima Online, if you wanted to run a shop, you had to pay a rent on it per month to keep that shop open. Some games also have paid companions, mercenaries that you pay to be in the group. We did this in Temple, where you either pay them to be in the group, or they took a certain items from found loot. And those are, those exist as money sinks. There's also one other one that I don't use as much, and I'll talk about this in a minute, but in-game microtransactions that you can use in-game currency for, like buying cosmetic stuff. If it uses in-game currency, that's another sink. I tend not to use that one.

But the problem is, almost every game out there has more sources than sinks, and the sources are easier to find than the sinks are to avoid. So you find, did I say that right? I'm basically saying it's very easy to take advantage of all the sources, but in a lot of RPGs, it's very easy to avoid all the sinks. You don't have to buy things at a vendor because it's dropping too much. You repair stuff yourself. You heal yourself. Maybe your game doesn't have trainers, or maybe you're being a generalist, so you paid the small amount to have lots of low-level skills trained, and you don't really have any specialties. All of these things are, avoid all of the sinks in an RPG are usually avoidable or minimizable.

So that leads us to the third part of an economy, which is currency. Now, most people think, I think, I'm saying money, but if you've ever played a game where some things that you can carry around are weightless, like ammo for guns or arrows for bows, those are currency, no matter what else you think of them. If you play those games long enough, and you don't use the weapons that use that ammo, it's effectively a currency. It's weightless. It builds up in your inventory, and if you're ever at a vendor, you can just convert it to currency immediately by selling it. So there's a lot of currencies floating around, those RPGs, that are basically, it's equivalent to money, and you can carry it around completely weightlessly, and they almost all of them stack, so it's just like money.

Now, like I said, the goal of an economy is to balance your source and sinks. I've mentioned how hard this is because it's avoidable. And the reason this is really hard in games to do is for all the classes or skill types, basically the player character types that can be built, you can make, you can design one or use one in such a way that you avoid sinks. I'll give you an example. Let's say you're making a fantasy game, and you're like, well, arrows use up a lot of ammo, or arrows, bows use arrows, people got to buy arrows. Not all classes are going to use bows. Some don't even use armor and weapons. If you have a Monk class who basically fights in a pair of shorts and doesn't even use weapons, that person will not only never buy weapons and armor, they'll never have to repair them. That class is almost designed to avoid two big sinks in a fantasy RPG. Also, some difficulty levels in-game say, oh yeah, you don't have to worry about eating or drinking or sleeping at this difficulty level. Well, guess what, you wiped out three sinks right there with a difficulty level.

So what I'm saying is, a lot of thought can be put into an economy to balance it, but if your RPG is also rich in what kind of character a player can make and how their gameplay is, they can always find a way where they're getting all the sources, and they're avoiding a lot of the sinks, and that's why this balancing is so incredibly hard.

Unlike real-life economy, which people still haven't solved, by the way, I have to eat, I have to drink, I have to live somewhere. They're built-in money sinks in our world that just don't exist in RPGs. Now, there's one that players can't avoid, which the original AD&D used, which was when you go up a level, you have to pay for it. The original AD&D used that. It was something like 1,500 gold times the level you're leveling out of. So when you're first level, and you can go to second level, it's 1,500, but then when you're second level and you get enough XP to be third, that's 3,000, then you're third level, you go, that's 4,500. That's a lot of money, and it adds up. I don't know, I don't think I've met any player who loves that system, and it's one of the truly unavoidable sinks, but nobody likes it. And I, I don't think I've seen a modern RPG with it. Correct me in the comments if I'm wrong.

There's also another sink source that I don't ever use, and that's the microtransaction around pay-to-win, and that's where people can use outside currency as a source in the game to buy anything that's not cosmetic. I don't care if it lets you buy a heal potion. If it converts to money you can spend in an auction house to buy real weapons and armor, if you can convert outside money to inside game wealth, that economy will never be balanced. That effectively, you've

 thrown a monkey wrench in it and will never be balanced. Also, let me tell you the final reason why I think this is all really hard to balance. So I've described the entire economy, sources, sinks, seems like it should be pretty easy. I have never shipped a game that I have experienced 100% of the content of before ship. There's always a quest, an NPC line, an item, something that I didn't see before we shipped, even as a game director. And even on The Outer Worlds, where I played that game over a dozen times, I think I played it 16 times from start to finish before it shipped. And there's a lot of reasons for that. One, my character may not have been able to have all the content, may not have been able to see all the content. I like making my games that way, that you don't get to see everything with a particular build. But when I first started playing The Outer Worlds, which was probably about seven or eight months before we even shipped, when I started doing my plays to completion, not all the content was in. So I remember watching a speedrunner get into some complex once by jumping on crates that were near an electric fence. Those crates weren't there when I made my playthrough. I remember turning to Leonard and going, look, he got in there on those crates. And afterwards, I was like, those crates, I've never seen those crates before.

So you may play the game a lot, but because there's 70 people working on it and lots of hands going in there, something may get changed before shipping, and you don't actually play it. Because of that, those things can affect the economy as well. All of a sudden, there's a quest that gives a really amazing item, and it's repeatable, or suddenly a change to a rule means you can get a better faction reaction, and suddenly their vendor is giving a lot more money than you had planned for because the player can become so well liked by that faction that they get great deals there. In fact, one thing we always try to make sure in open-world RPGs is that items have a particular value, that you can never buy them for less than that or sell them for more because otherwise, that could create that buy-and-sell loop where the player could just go, I'll take all your potions, sell them to him, take all more potions, sell them to him, and then make a ton of money. So even putting those kinds of rules in there are still other ways people can manipulate sources and sinks to just make a lot of money.

So what am I saying here? Economy is difficult. I don't think you ever see it truly balanced, especially for games that let you play, make, and play how you want any kind of player character. You will find a way of gaming the system. Yes, many games, including my own, could have been way better balanced before they came out. For all the reasons I stated, they're not. Personally, I don't worry about this too much, the same reason I don't worry about save scumming, or, you know, I don't even really worry about cheating that much. Most of my games are single-player experiences. You're only cheating yourself out of an experience. You know, if I play a game and I end up with half a million gold coins, okay, that's fine. Not saying don't try to do a better job next time on it, but I know the reason that game economies will never be perfect.

Now that, wow, that's almost 20 minutes, and like I said, that's scratching the surface of game economy. But I hope that answers questions people have about it and also gives you an idea of how economies are even implemented in the first place.

Hi everyone, it's me Tim. Today I want to talk about game engines. I've had several people ask about whether I prefer making my own game engine or using one of the off-the-shelf available ones, and almost always when they ask that, they're talking about Unity or Unreal. There are other ones, they're game solid, and a couple more, but the two Big E's right now are Unity and Unreal.

So to answer that question, my question is pretty much a qualified well, but at the end I'll give a definite like look, for all practical purposes, there's an answer to this. But as always, I want to tell stories. You have to remember that I started back in 1981, and for about the first 20 years of my career, there was no option here; this was not a choice. You made your own engine; there was really nothing available to buy. I even remember saying in one of my videos it was really hard in the 90s just convincing other programmers at Interplay to share code. I wanted to write some code one time and then just share it with the other programmers; you don't have to worry about bank switching on different video cards; you don't have to worry about assembly language to get them a second timer here it is, and a lot of programmers wanted to do that, but there were some programs like nope I only use my own code they would literally not let anyone see their source and only give their code out as pre-compiled libraries. Whatever, to each their own.

From 1981 to 2014, I only used engines that were made in-house at the company I was at, with one exception, and that was Vampire: Bloodlines, which we made with Valve's Source engine that was used for Half-Life and Half-Life 2. Besides that game, every game I made, I made the engine from scratch, from nothing. That's where Fallout, Bart's Tale, and Rags and Fallout and Arcanum and Temple and WildStar, even South Park. South Park, we used an engine that had been made in-house at Obsidian for Dungeon Siege 3; they called it Onyx. They had a lot of generic components that we just used for South Park, even though that's a wildly different game.

But since 2014, I've made two Unity games, Pillars of Eternity and Tyranny, and one Unreal game, The Outer Worlds, and now I guess The Outer Worlds 2 is being made. So I can talk about those particular engines and what I saw as the pros and cons, but I should also caveat that with I went into both of those game engines for Unity, I already knew C#, and for Unreal, I already knew C++. Those are the two languages that you use for Unity; it's for doing scripts from hooks from the engine, and for Unreal, you actually get the source code, and it's in C++, so you can do your scripts in the visual scripting language they provide, but your programmers will be diving into the engine itself with C++.

So there's that caveat there. I already knew both of those languages, so to me, Unity, Unreal were pretty level, and I could compare them back to back. But let me start with saying I'm going to say the advantages and disadvantages of using your own Engine versus using an off-the-shelf one. Note that a lot of the pros for one of these is a con for the other one, so I'm not going to repeat those. I'm only gonna I'll give the pros for them, and then any cons that are unique to them that aren't just oh well this other one the pro for this one was this so the pro for the con for this one is not this, I'm not going to do that.

So let me start with your own engines. What I love about making my own engine is you can have it do exactly what you want. Your Own, what this means is you don't end up with an over-engineered system that has hooks in it for doing a lot of things you don't want that spend cycles, you know, setting up data a certain way, even though you're not going to take advantage of it. Now, the off-the-shelf engines, some of them are pretty good about you know, saying what components you want and what you don't. I mean, when you start up Unity, it's like you got to make a 2D game or a 3D game; you're going to make a side scroller. I mean, I get it, but you still end up with a lot of things you don't want that just hang around eating cycles and memory.

The other thing I love about making my own engine is you own the source code, like I own Arcanum and Tempo source code, and you are very familiar with it, so towards the end of the game, when you are trying to optimize and debug, you know this code inside and out, and so you have a leg up because you just you literally know what this code is, how it was written, and what your intention was to do with it. Which gets me to the third thing I love about your own engines, is you optimize it exactly where you want it to be optimized. If you know your game is going to heavily be dependent on lighting, especially dynamic lighting, you can optimize for that rather than end up with this generic lighting system that was designed to do static lighting and dynamic lighting and maybe you know, no lighting whatsoever. No, you can you can optimize it for exactly what you need. Similarly, if you if you don't need multiplayer, you can just you're not going to spend any time on the network code; you can just you won't have written that; it won't be sitting there hanging around; it won't have been brought in and then excluded later when it gets compiled out. These are all really things I love about making my own engine, plus just personally, it's fun. I love making an engine; it it lets you touch all the different parts of the game that you normally wouldn't touch.

But there is a huge con with making your own engine, which should be obvious. You will need a lot of time, a lot of money, and a lot of people because you are literally reinventing the wheel, and not just one wheel; you're inventing; you're reinventing a lot of wheels. And I don't think you're going to do as good a job on it. You may be really good at code, but do you really know all the GPU pipelines, do you know pixel shaders, do you know network cards, do you know the OS interface for networking, do you know every ins and outs of everything about the operating system you're writing for, how it allocates memory, how it handles timers and input. Do you know that for every version of the operating system you're making for, do you know that for the other operating systems on the other platforms you're making for because you have to know all this as well as the people making the engines. Benefits, you might on a few of these, you certainly won't on all of them, and you might even not know them as well as the people making the engine on any of them, so good luck with that.

So let's talk about game engines. What's the advantage of buying an off-the-shelf engine? A

, it works immediately. I can't tell you how refreshing it was when we jumped into Pillars that we literally had something up and running; there was no like prototyping phase. We lived something up and running really fast; it was really cool, and because there's so much stuff available for free, artwork and stuff, you can throw together a prototype in literally no time and then go okay let's replace all this art later, but look we've got a world you can run around in, you've got some dude running around you can do things. It's also very easy to find people who already know these engines, and it's getting easier every single year as Unity and Unreal basically start owning the market. It's easy to find programmers for either, therefore that transition into it's easy to hire people who know these engines, and that's awesome. By the way, conversely for these people, they like that you're using this because it gets them experience in something that matters, in an engine more than just at your company. If you have a game and you make your own engine for it, those programmers are getting experience in nothing but that, and it doesn't transfer to any other company. Now you, the company, may go this is great for employee retention, but new hires are going to look at that and go do I really want to get stuck here, do I really want to go to another company and go I have 15 years experience in engine X, which nobody uses and nobody knows how it works, so the idea that you might be making a gaming Unity, Unreal for your employees, that is a really good decision too.

Also, because this engine comes with support, you get support from a company that's probably much bigger than yours, certainly in terms of programming staff, with tons of specialists in it, so you have these people who are at your beck and call effectively. You can report bugs to them, and they will fix it. Um, often, like I mentioned, these people have a lot of specialists, so this engine code will have a lot of specialty code that you may not either have been able to make in-house at all, or you would have had to hire a very expensive specialist, and it would take a long time, so we're talking time and money and people in great quantities, so by having an engine just saves you and all that.

However, the flip side of that is when you do need support, good luck getting it. Um, if you're a big company and you're doing a very popular well-known game and you've met personally with people from the company making the game engine, yeah, you might be able to get to the front of the queue on some bugs, but most of you find yourself waiting for point releases to see if that bug that you discovered that maybe your game is dependent on has been fixed, and if it hasn't, with Unity, good luck, you do not have the source code; with Unreal, okay, you can dive into the source code and spend your own time and money and resources fixing it, but then every time you get a new point release, you're going to have to fold that code. The other big problem with these is they take a cut of your revenue. Most of them have switched from you paying something up front to they get a percentage of the revenue stream from your game. Now for smaller companies, they waive this or make it a smaller cut, but once you're making a fairly big game, expect to give some of your money to Unity or Epic because you're using their engine. That's just the way it is. If you roll your own, you don't have that.

Now, here's my answer on which way I think you should go. In a perfect world where there was no budget, no schedule, no pressure, of course, I would like to make my own engine. I like to roll my own; it just has all the advantages they want and other disadvantages, but notice that by saying with no budget and schedule on anything, I just erased all the disadvantages that could possibly exist. We don't live in a perfect world, so unless you plan to make an engine that you reuse for decades, or for some reason, you're in an amazing situation for every time you have a new game idea, you can make a brand new engine that's specifically designed for that. I think you just eventually need to come to the terms that you will be using Unity or Unreal or another off-the-shelf game engine at some point in your career; you're going to have to bite that bullet. Once you do, yes, there are those cons I mentioned, but now you have a much better understanding this engine what it can be used for, and your employees have really good skills in that engine. So I think that I think that that um it's called that horses run that dog is out the gate, I don't know what whatever that phrase is. I pretty much think that the decision has been made for you unless if you're in an incredibly rare circumstance that would allow you to make your own engine. I think from now on, people are going to be making games in existing game engines, and it looks like Unity pretty much owns if it's a 2D or a mobile game, Unity if it's especially a bigger game, especially in an open world, it's probably going to be Unreal. There are other ones out there too that might make more sense for a specific game you're making, but I think in this day and age, if you're thinking about making a game, it is in your best interest to look at the existing off-the-shelf games, see if there's a good match already before you go and reinvent the wheel and make your own game into it. So that's my thoughts on that.

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim, and today I want to talk about game lore. I want to answer a question from armored spaz who asks how do you keep players informed about the game world and how could the game be designed to make the player want to find out more about the game. I think this is a really good question. I almost didn't answer it though because it kind of moves into the narrative design territory that I have said in the past I'm not that good at. But, I think I'm good at thinking about narrative design, I'm just not good at implementing narrative design, so let's talk about that.

Also, I want to break this question up into two questions, which is how can you keep them informed, and then how can you make them want to become more informed. So, I think that falls naturally out of talking about what the sources of game lore are. There's ones that the game drives, that the game forces on you, and then there's ones that the player drives, that the player wants to know more and starts digging down. So, I'll talk about game-driven, then player-driven, and finally how to make the player want to look for lore.

So, the game-driven sources are anything where the game provides you with game world lore and information that you didn't ask for. Probably the biggest thing about that is just the game world itself. You see things in the world that basically tell you this is how the world is, maybe fortified villages and lots of guards, and you're like, "This a dangerous world." Then there's NPC barks, which is things that NPCs say without going into dialogue just when you walk by near them, and a bark is a really important source of lore because you may be walking around that heavily fortified village and a guard may go, "Hope those bandits don't attack again today." Without doing any lifting, you now know that this is a dangerous world and there's a lot of bandits out there. And maybe another nearby guard goes, "Well, I'd rather have bandits than dragons." Okay, you just learned a lot about this world, and you didn't do anything.

Also, whenever you start a conversation with an NPC, whether it's to, you know, at a vendor or you're turning in a quest, how NPCs start conversations can be an important source of lore. You might go up to a vendor and go, "Welcome to my shop. I hope I have what you need. Bandits have been attacking my caravans lately." And then you can say, "Show me your inventory."

Which brings me into player-driven sources. One of the options on that NPC should be, "What's going on with these caravans? How can I help?" These are NPC dialogue deep dives where it's the player's choice to talk with the NPC about a particular topic and learn about it. It's not the game forcing it on you; it's the player wanting to go, "Hey, I want to know more about this topic," and they can go through those dialogues. Now, maybe sometimes you need a good social skill to have the NPC talk more about it, maybe you need to persuade them to talk about it, or maybe you need to lie and say, "Hey, I was hired to handle that caravan problem, tell me about it."

Another player-driven source would be books in the world or newspapers. We did newspapers in Arcanum. These are things that the player has to choose to interact with, but if they do, they tend to get a lot of lore dumped on them at once. Exploration, the newspapers were interesting in that we tempted you to do it because sometimes there were stories about you.

And then the other way that there are player-driven sources are just exploration. The player chooses to go out into the world and go around. Maybe you see a lot of ruins and you're like, "What happened to these?" Maybe you find dilapidated wagons and overturned chests and dead caravan people, and you're like, "Hm, this is a dangerous place for caravans around here." You know, maybe you find a cave with bandits in it, you're like, "Oh, these are bandits that are doing caravan raids."

Just running around the world can teach the player a lot of lore. But one of the other questions that armored spaz had was how do you make players want to get at that lore. That's a really good question. I hinted on at one way with the newspapers. Once players looked at the newspaper and saw that there was a story about something they did and they were mentioned, that's a huge ego boost, and it probably will make players look at new additions of the newspaper to see if anything else they did get mentioned. Do not overlook the draw of the player's ego.

Another way of making players want lore is if the lore is somehow useful beyond just providing information. For example, if the lore gets the player past some hurdle or barrier, like there's somebody who won't talk to them, or there's a quest that they don't know where the location of the ruins are they're supposed to go to, but if they study lore, they can find that location, or they get that person to talk to them. That's a reason players would want lore.

If lore ever leads to new locations, like you're not even doing a quest, but every time you look at a book, occasionally it opens up a new location on your map and puts a marker there, and go, "Oh, I just read that there's a sunken city off the shore of this part of the, you know, if you go to this beach and go into the waves, there's a sunken city out there," or "I just found out there's an island offshore," or "I just found out there's a whole cave system below this mountain." Once players learn that lore leads to new locations, they're do it.

Another thing is if reading a book or another bit of lore somehow gives you a skill or perk bonus. Sometimes those are permanent, sometimes they're temporary. These are things that once people discover that, they're going to read every lore drop you create because they might get that crafting bonus.

Lore can also be a great way of being part of the crafting system, that recipes for things are buried in lore books, and not just don't even think of it as recipes for like food or making armor. Maybe magic items have to be researched before you can make it. You can't just make a wand of fireballs; you have to learn lore craft. You have to go read old tomes about how people made wands of fireballs in the past.

Which leads me to another great thing you can do with lore, which is maybe some spells have a prerequisite of you need to know lore to cast a spell. Now for a fireball, that kind of hard to justify, but what if there was a summoning spell. When you get that spell, it just summons a generic, let's say it summons a generic demon. However, you learn that if you deep dived into demon lore, you could learn the names of demons, and suddenly that spell will summon you a named demon that's way more powerful. Suddenly, you have, I bet you will have lots of wizard players who are interested in lore.

And then lastly, I think a really cool thing to do with

 lore is that it adds functionality to existing items. This is something that I like because they actually supported this in the original AD&D; if you read the section on artifacts and relics, artifacts and relics came with a whole array of minor and major powers, and sometimes the major powers were locked behind the player needing to learn how to use this artifact. Maybe there was lore they had to learn, maybe there are people they had to go talk to, maybe there are sacrifices they had to do, but there was something they had to learn about, and possibly from learning about, had to then do in order to unlock the major powers. This is a really cool thing for items because it lets a player get one item, like a really cool sword, and then over time while they're playing the game, they unlock abilities of that sword through lore, and I think that's a really cool thing that you could do.

Finally, one way, just to be blunt about it with players, is lore grants XP. The same way that, you know, finishing a quest or maybe your game gives you XP for killing a monster, or maybe it gives you XP for discovering a new location, every time you learn a new piece of lore, and maybe it gets recorded into your lore book, you get XP. Suddenly, you probably have a lot of players who really don't care about lore, but they're learning it because they want the XP. I think that's a cool way of dangling bait in front of the player to get them to do something they otherwise wouldn't do, and then it turns out to be a good thing in the long run that they know that lore. As the player, they suddenly tell their friends what a deep game you have, even though they wouldn't have done that deep dive if you hadn't provided XP.

Now, as a bonus, I'm going to throw in like things you might want to go deep on this, like let's say you really like some of the ideas I've told you and you're making a game and you want it to be super lore-heavy, lore-dependent. Well, the first thing you could do is you could make a literacy skill, so players are illiterate unless they buy into the literacy skill, which meaning they pick up a book, a map, or whatever, they can't read it, it's not, doesn't, they don't can't read. Then all the different literacy lore sources you have out there have literacy prerequisites. Maybe you bought the literacy skill, but you find a really complicated tome on demon summoning, and it requires a really high literacy skill. Maybe you spend more points in that skill so you can read that too and unlock whatever it's going to give you.

What's really cool is if you put that in a game that does everything I said lore could unlock, that it gets you past that, it gets you quests, it gets you new locations, it gets you skill bonuses, gets you crafting recipes, gets you spell prerequisites, adds functionality to artifacts, grants XP. If you do all of that and unlock it with the literacy skill, I bet you, you're going to have a lot of players playing your game to learn the lore so they can do all those other things, and as a side benefit, your game will probably be known for having a lot of really deep, interconnected, interesting lore because you led the player into wanting to know more about it through game mechanics.

Anyway, armored spaz, I hope this answers your question. I hope other people found this beneficial.

Game Pacing.md

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim. Today I want to talk about game pacing. DG 135 says, "I think it would be a really interesting to know about your perspective and experience on the difficulty of pacing open world games, both in its narrative and gameplay." I thought that was a really neat comment; it's not even a question, just comment that I'm now going to comment on.

Open world games are difficult to do game pacing. Let me talk about game pacing first. I view game pacing as a set of highs and lows that happen while the player goes through the game. Mostly, I see this as combat versus non-combat, combat or what people call downtime. Downtime could be anything from exploration to crafting to going back to town for using vendors or just going back to your home or home base or whatever you have in the game to drop stuff off and change companions, do whatever you do at a home base. In general, I think that's right, although there are some exciting things that can happen outside side of combat, and also combat itself can be paced.

When you are walking through the forest and you run into a wolf, that's a very different combat than you're walking through the forest and you run into a dragon. But at a low level, that wolf might be tough, and even at higher levels, if it's a pack of wolves, that might be a tough fight, and fighting a dragon is probably impossible early on and then is a tough fight for a long time, until finally, they become pretty easy. Anything gets easy after a while.

But that's just an example of how even if you're talking about combat, you can talk about whether it's combat that's intended to really be a major point in the game or oh, it's just something the player stumbled across on the road on the way to a dungeon. I described this once, when I was at Carbine, I described this to my boss as monorails versus roller coasters. The reason you want highs and lows and your pacing in a game is you want it to be like a roller coaster. Everyone likes riding roller coasters; that's exciting. You're way up high, you go down low, the acceleration, the slowdown, that's really exciting. Monorail, they're not exciting. Monorail can be really high up too; it has nothing to do with the height, it has to do with the fact that it is unchanging. So, I was very much against making a game of all bosses, which is what had been suggested for that game, and people even used Shadow of the Colossus as an example. It's like, "Hey, Tim, we can do a game of all bosses." But if you think about Shadow of Colossus, it was getting on your horse and riding through the countryside, very pleasant, very then you'd have a big fight with a boss, then it was get on your horse, go through the countryside, and then it was another big, another big boss, totally different boss. So even that had pacing like this.

You can't just have a game that's boss, boss, boss, boss. I know I talked a lot about old and ring. I liked that even though you were constantly in danger, it was different whether you're in an instance or not, it was different whether it was a named thing you were fighting or not, it was, you could tell there was a pacing to it.

Now, open world, and by that, I mean nonlinear, I don't necessarily want people to think of it as players can choose where they want to go. That is far more difficult to do pacing because you're not in control of where the player wants to go. However, you are in control of some things, and you can do pacing within them. One of those is the main storyline. The main storyline is linear, even though how the player gets from one act to the next, we often provide multiple ways of getting there. That's where you can do pacing. You could have an act where most of the activities that move forward are talking to NPCs. You can have an act where most of the activities that move the storyline forward are going to find evidence, going to find items, maybe you can steal them, maybe you have to fight for them, it doesn't matter. And then you can maybe have an act where, yeah, it's a big fight in this act. Fallout New Vegas, when you go to the dam, it's one big fight. Doesn't matter how good of a talker you are, you're going to go and have a fight. Maybe you can have some, if you're a good talker, you can have more people on your side, maybe you show up with better equipment, but you're going to have a fight.

I like that. I like that there are different acts or different things in a storyline. Also, even though you may make a big nonlinear world, inside of a particular instance, whether at the dungeon or vault, whatever, or town, whatever you make as your instance, you can pace things within there. You can have a dungeon start with an in-game cinematic, you know, a ghost appears and says, "Oh my god, I've lost my boo blocks, it's somewhere in this dungeon," and you're like, "I'll get your boo blocks," and then you go in and you might have a light combat, you might discover something to read, there might be a trap to figure out, then there might be a big combat, and then you got the boo blocks. That's an example of how you can control pacing inside an instance inside an open world.

Another thing I used to do to try to make pacing vary up is inside random encounters. You saw this in Fallout; you're going along the world, most of your encounters are with creatures that immediately are hostile to you. Some of them, you might stumble across two creatures that are fighting each other, so there's no immediate hostility to you, but you may have to choose a side, and that side may be whoever wins that fight. But then, a lot of the random special random encounters, the luck-based ones, they weren't violent at all. They were, you found something interesting, and that's where you get the Red Rider BB gun or the Alien Blaster. And I did that because in Fallout, when you're going along, there's that tension already, you're going along the world map, then it goes, 'cuz you out random account, you're like, "Ah, what is it?" You drop down, yeah, a lot of times it's combat, but sometimes it's not, and there's that. So there's that randomness, there's that gambling aspect of what will it be. That's a great way of just saying, "Hey, this is pacing," it's such form of pacing.

You can also pace inside of dialogues. One thing we always did as rules in dialogues, as far back as Fallout, was there should always be an early out for people who just want to get in, talk to advance the quest they're in, or the storyline, or to get the piece of information they want, and then they get out. "I don't want to have to be in here for 10 minutes talking to this person about, you know, how they don't get spots out of their laundry."

 However, some people want to deep dive into that. Something will come up, and they want to ask questions to the NPC about it. "What kind of spots do you mean? Is it just in your whites? What detergent do you use?" Those kinds of deep dives, you can allow them, and that's the player getting what they want. This is, I think, a really cool thing, and I'm glad that players like to do it, but I'd always remind the narrative designers, we have to support both of this. We can't have a game that forces you in a dialogue you don't want to be in, or that kicks you out without letting you have some follow-up.

Originally in Fallout, that "tell me about" stuff was to allow people to see if an NPC had any topics that they could deep dive on. Should have explored that more, probably could with AI today, but that's another video.

Now, bear in mind that in any game where the player's kind of in control of the narrative, which most of mine, um, that means the player has control of pacing. So I understand the initial source of this comment and the implied question of like, "How do you do this?" Ultimately, you do relinquish control to the player. If a player goes into your dungeon and finds a bookcase full of books and decides they're going to read all of it, they're going to read each one of these, and then later they complain about how the pacing in the dungeon was off, that's on them. You have to seed a certain level of control over to the player and hope that they understand that they have this control. The way I've described it to people is, my games offer a variety, but you have to select it. It's like, here's your menu, there's a bunch of stuff on the menu, you may not like some of it, and you know what you like and what you don't like. If you pick something off the menu, if you're like, "I hate cilantro, but I'm going to try your cilantro salsa," and then you don't like it, you probably shouldn't blame the restaurant. Similarly, if you play Fallout, or Arcanum, or Outer Worlds, you can, if you just want to do combat, if you just want to fight, fight, fight, you can do that. If you don't want to fight, yes, there are some random encounters you're going to have to run from, but for the most part, you can choose to talk to people, to stealth, to avoid that stuff. So the pacing, that level of pacing, is up to you.

Later, it is sometimes frustrating for people to go, "Yeah, I didn't like the pacing in this level," or "I didn't like the pacing in the whole game." I get it, but a lot of times, I just leave that up to them, and I would prefer to have an open world, nonlinear game than not. So I just accept that as part and parcel; the pacing is under control of the player. However, I do provide the variety, and I hope I've explained like how you can provide variety in combat, even in dialogue, inside dungeons, in the storyline, even in random encounters, to try to give the player that ups and downs that I described. And I want a roller coaster experience until they slide into the end. I don't want a monorail, and those are my thoughts on game pacing.

Game Production Stages.md
Youtube Link:
https://youtu.be/IADSh_P05As?si=W3pjRVyKBMqKL75R

Hi everyone, it's me Tim, and today I want to talk about game production stages. This is actually an answer to a question I got from Charlie K 5964 who asks as a follow-up to the ideas video, "What should go into the Prototype? Should it be a minimum viable product or should things like art be included?"

Now that's a really good question, but couple things. Different companies call different things a prototype, so what I thought I'd do is walk through the stages that my games have gone through and I'll tell you the names I give them. Just bear in mind that some companies will call these different things. Also, it turns out, and this isn't just for Charlie Kay's question but it's true, it's a really good question that I'm surprised it never occurred to me to do a video on. This is an example of I've just been using these terms for decades. I don't even think about them, the idea that somebody wouldn't know like what a vertical or horizontal slice was or a beautiful corner. I have to be reminded that even though everybody I talk to at work always seems to know what all these terms are, once you go outside the business, people are like "beautiful corner?"

So let me go through them in order. This is roughly the stages that a game production will go through. So probably the first thing that gets made, and I'm not going to talk about design docs and art meetings and all that, I'm talking about things that we actually make with the engine that other people in the development team will use. So the first things that are probably made are test rooms. These are individual levels, stages, rooms, whatever you want to call them, that are designed to test a feature in isolation. So they tend to be broken up into different kinds of test rooms. A combat test room may have a single creature, a couple creatures, a group of creatures, a boss, a creature that does a particular kind of attack like a breath weapon or something. There's usually a table or chest filled with different weapons in case you don't know what the cheat codes are for getting them, you can just go grab one. Some of the creatures are set to fight back, some aren't. Sometimes there's a big button on the wall you know press to turn off creature AI so you can just turn it off and you can just test a weapon, test a combat maneuver you're putting in without actually being attacked back by the creature.

Similarly, there's stealth test rooms that have places that have locks to pick of different difficulties, computers to hack, traps to disarm, guards to sneak by, you know vents or what we call them in Out of Worlds, crouch holes, things to test like this is how you know I can go into these things and avoid combat, this is test stealth detection, things like that. There's a dialogue test room that does things everything from here's how close you have to get to someone before dialogue activates, here's what a dialogue looks like, you know what the NPC camera is like, here's what dialogue between multiple NPCs would be like, here's what dialogue that includes companions would be like. Here's an example of events that can break a dialogue like you might have a room you can go into where you start talking to someone and then combat breaks out.

And finally, there's exploration test rooms. These are rooms that test things like jumping and crouching. This is how high I can jump, this is how low I can crouch and still go under things. Again, these are put in so that anyone on the team can go in and go oh this is the minimum height something can be that I can still get under it, this is the maximum height something can be that I can jump up to it, something we can go to and look at. So when you're maybe a level designer is making a brand new level and he wants to know what those bounds are.

The next thing that's made, to answer Charlie K's question directly, is a prototype. A prototype is something that's put together to test all features together. It's playable game but it's not final art. In fact, sometimes the prototype might even be gray box where you know it's you're just in these gray rooms, you're it's there to test maybe oh this is how one of our levels may be put together, the pacing of combat, traps, guards, dialogues. It's an example of this is what the game will feel like to play, but it won't look like this.

Conversely, around the time of a prototype, usually after but very rarely I've seen it done at the same time or before, you make something called a beautiful corner. A beautiful corner is usually done to show the team or the publisher, "this this is what the game is going to look like when we ship." It's also a test to make sure that the artists are capable of creating the art, the in-game art that looks like what the concept art was like. A beautiful corner is very small area, um, it's usually not playable, and if it is playable you just can walk around it, the the player instantiates and can just walk. If it's not playable then it's usually a camera that you just move through the area. It's a small section and the reason it's often called a beautiful corner is if you turn around 180° and look behind you, you can see oh it's not the art isn't doesn't isn't behind me, it's just in front of me. The beautiful corner for Outer Worlds was a water treatment plant. You could walk among the equipment, you could look out windows, a ship flew by, there was a person near the top that was just standing there. You could actually see this is what the game would look like when it shipped.

Then there are two other things that are made later, a year or two in development or I should say 50 to 50% maybe halfway 2/3 of the way through development. They're the two slices. I've heard vertical slice used a lot. A vertical slice is you take one area to completion. It has virtually every feature that's going to be in the shipped game, virtually all the art will be finished. The purpose of a vertical slice is to show exactly what the game will be like. It'll look like this, it'll play like this, this is the game. Now when I say virtually, it's because because it's one area there may be some things you can't show like if it's a town maybe you can't show harvesting resources, if it's an outdoor area maybe you can't show fast travel to another location because that just isn't there. The vertical slice for Outer Worlds was Roseway which had several instances in it, a town and the ship, but it didn't include crafting because the crafting table, the crafting station was on the ship and we didn't let you go in the ship. Because of that, it also didn't include fast travel to another level, it also didn't let you switch your companions. You started with two companion because you couldn't get back in the ship, you couldn't switch them. That was all done deliberately because those features weren't available yet, we only had two companions done but everything else about that level was done to completion including VO for the companions, sometimes that something that would be left out of vertical slice, we actually did it

. So Roseway actually we had that over a year before we shipped, we actually had a playable level and we said look this is what the game's going to be like. That was very cool because it got by that point everybody, publisher, development team, everybody should be on the same page because you can always go look at the vertical slice, the whole game's going to be like that.

Another one which I hadn't heard of a lot, I don't know if I came up with this term and I don't remember hearing it where before I started using it, was a horizontal slice. Horizontal slice is the a complete orthogonal idea to the vertical slice. A horizontal slice is all the areas in the game are playable but they're not completed, they're not to final completion. They may be some of them may be gray boxed, some of them may not have all of the content in that they're going to have, but they're they're roughly playable. And the reason for this and the reason you do a horizontal slice is several reasons. One, you want to figure out how all these levels are connected. You may discover that you have a level and you didn't think about how the player was going to get there, he can't walk there because it's physically disconnected. Oh I guess we need to put a landing pad here because the only way they're going to get there is with the ship. Sometimes you can't get to a map unless you get a quest for the map to that takes you there. Those are things we have to figure out. It's like well this quest has to be something everybody can get, it can't be a side quest that we only support limited player character types for. The other thing you do with horizontal slice is you figure out play time. You can figure out the rough play time of your game once you have the horizontal SLS because you have all the levels, they're roughly playable, they've got most but not all of their content. So if you put together a horizontal slice and you can play it in 20 hours, you're pretty sure your game isn't going to be less than 20 hours because you're going to be putting even more content in. It just gives you a good overall idea of did we make a 20-hour game, a 40-hour game, an 80-hour game. And then finally, especially for the G kind of games I make which are nonlinear, a horizontal slice lets you figure out ordering issues. It lets you figure out things like oh what happens if the player goes to this level before they go to this level, what happens if as soon as getting the quest over here they run over here instead. These are things you have to figure out. Are the are all the different play options available to the character, are they telegraphed, is the player at least warned this is a tough level to go to, are there NPCs that don't respond correctly in their dialogue to the player having already gone to some other place out of order. Something we really tried to do in all of our games is not make any assumption that the player had done something or hadn't done something before talking to an NPC. The horizontal slice lets you work out a lot of that. By the way, the horizontal slice eventually turns into the game. As you fill it with more and more content, eventually you stop calling it the horizontal slice and it becomes the game.

The next stage is the alpha stage. I've heard this called different things at different companies, but the alpha stage is when all the areas are in, they're all playable, all the content's in. Unlike the horizontal slice, all the content's in but the alpha may still be unbalanced, it may be, well probably is, buggy, and it may be missing small amounts of final content. Like maybe all the crafting stations are in and all the correct locations but maybe not every recipe has been finished or maybe all the recipes are in but some of the resources you're supposed to get that you're supposed to harvest, they haven't finished putting down where all of those are yet. So maybe you're supposed to mine a certain ore and all the places where you can mine that ore aren't completed yet but at least one is. So we consider this an alpha because you can test it, figure out all the things a player potentially can do.

The beta is the next and final stage before shipping. The beta is when all the content's in, there's no more, you're not going to say we're going to add any more, any more content, side content, tasks, achievements, nothing, it's all in. Beta is the time where you fix bugs, do any final balancing tweaks to formulas for combat or vendor prices, and this is where optimization is done. You can optimize a little in the earlier stages especially if it's affecting development like some level is has a frame rate that's so bad you can't even test it, but this is the stage, the beta stage, where most of the optimization should happen. I've already talked about the dangers of early optimization, so this is why you should have a beta stage to let the programmers and artists, artists are often responsible for optimization too when they put in too many big textures or models with too many polygons in them.

And then that's the last stage until the final stage, final ship. That's when the game goes out, people are playing it, Hallelujah, you're done, right? No, patches. Patches, you may do official and unofficial patches. Patches can fix bugs, patches can balance the game, patches can put in a little extra content that maybe you missed like maybe there's a um some voiceover missing from NPC and you fix all that stuff in patches. And now you're done, right? Wait, there's one more thing, there's DLC, downloadable content. DLC is anything from extra packs that you give like cosmetic packs that people can buy, it's like oh look there's new armor, there's new hats, there's new crafting recipes, or could be full-on content, um DLC which has new levels, new storyline, new ventures you can do, the level cap may be increased, new perks are added, new skills are added, skills have their their cap increased. DLC does all of that. I don't consider that a patch, that's all the DLC, that basically makes more content for the game. Now sometimes things get blurred and sometimes DLCs seem like sequels, um and sequels sometimes seem like expensive DLCs, but that's roughly all the stages that a game goes through.

So just to recap, test rooms, prototype, beautiful corner, vertical slice, horizontal slice, alpha, beta, ship, patch, DLC. Nine stages. I think that answered Charlie K's question and maybe a few other questions. So, hope you liked it.

Gameplay Influence on Story.md
Youtube Link:
https://youtu.be/fzUzRqmgJKE?si=W5KFl6rlhhhklI6J

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim, and today I want to talk about gameplay's influence on story. Moji XOXO asks, "How much does gameplay influence what stories are or can be told in video games? How do developers grapple with the tension of a story that wants to do one thing or go a certain way while ensuring that gameplay stays consistently fun and engaging throughout?" That is a good question. I think I've touched on this in other videos a bit, but I'll just restate it here. It is very, very challenging for video game narrative designers to stop thinking linearly. Most of them are used to writing stories, whether they're for books, movies, or TV shows, and those proceed linearly, where games, at least RPG games which is what I'm talking about here, do not, or mine don't, and that's something I want to talk about.

So, the first red flag to me goes off when I'm having meetings with narrative designers, and they say things like, "The player goes here, and the player does this," and the first thing I say is, "What if the player goes there and does something else? What if the player doesn't go there at all?" I've literally had narrative designers go, "We will force them to go there, and then we will lock them in that space. They cannot leave until they do the thing we want." That does not sound fun to me, and I don't think it sounds fun to you or a lot of other RPG players.

So, what I usually tell narrative designers is, do not think of your story based on player action; instead, make your story based on player goals, and you don't care how the player does it. For example, don't tell the player to go to the goblin cave and get this item; just tell the player that I want this item. I want it. If it's not a unique item and the player can go buy it somewhere, or the player can make it or anything else, that's great. Why would the quest giver care? He just wants the item.

Similarly, if you say, "Hey, this merchant got kidnapped; you need to go rescue him," that's a great goal, and it's a lot better than saying, "Go to this cave, kill the goblins, and rescue the merchant," because, first of all, it may be fun finding out who kidnapped the merchant in the first place. You may be told, "Oh well, we saw goblins, you know, in his shop earlier, and they were arguing," and then someone else may have told you, "Oh, there's a lot of goblin caves up in the mountain," so that gives you an idea of where to go. But because you weren't told you had to kill the goblins, maybe you go up there and talk them out, or maybe you pay them, or maybe they have something they want you to do. Maybe the merchant did something bad to them, and they want you to right that wrong. Whatever it turns out to be, all they, the person who gave you that quest, cares about is that you come back with the merchant.

So, let the story unfold based on the goal, not the action of the player. In fact, I hate the phrase "story-driven game," which is why for The Outer Worlds, I kept calling it a "player-driven story." Stories don't act; players act.

So, another thing you have to do if you're going to follow this, though, is you have to have fallbacks, and I talked about having fallbacks for my system mechanics. You need to have fallbacks in your story. For example, when you're being told to go get an item, what happens if the item is lost or sold, so you don't have it anymore? Is the quest failed? Is there a possibility to find it again? These are things you have to figure out before you start the quest.

Now, you can always put in system mechanics to try to prevent this. Maybe items marked as quest items can't be sold or destroyed, and that's one way to do it. But if you try to do that on the "rescue the merchant" quest, you end up with, "This NPC is marked as essential and cannot be killed," which I don't like, and I know a lot of you don't like. So, instead, what I try to think of is, come up with some alternate way for that quest to end, and maybe even incorporate it into an end slide later. If the merchant gets killed, maybe he was the only one who sold a particular kind of item, so you're not going to get that item anymore. So, if you can't craft it, too bad for you. Maybe the story can't proceed a certain way, so there will be an end slide about his death. These are fine. Players love the fact that the game will react to what happened and not a set thing that everybody who does it has the exact same thing happen. That's not as interesting.

So, in other words, don't tell the player what to do or where to go; just tell them what the goal is, and let them figure out where to go and what to do. It's a game. That is much more fun. Now, this can quickly get out of control, and I've talked about this before, but basically, you have to keep it simple. All the different ways you have of solving a quest, you have to keep it simple. Try to keep it systemic, meaning it's not something that you have to hand script for this particular situation. For example, if you're asked to get this item, and it's already something that's craftable, great, you already have a system for getting it. If it's not craftable, but you can put it in loot drops for creatures in the area, great, just add the item to the loot drops, and boom, the player has some way of going to get the item. If you want a unique particular item, then you're going to have to go put it in the inventory of some known, guaranteed-to-spawn creature, and you can do that too. 

Where it gets more difficult is if, like I mentioned with the goblins, they want you to do something for them, or they're bribable, or whatever, because now you have to write a dialogue. That would be the one solution to this quest that's going to require hand scripting. And trust me, your time is going to be filled with making and debugging scripted solutions to all your quests, so you want most of those solutions to be systemic because those can be tweaked easily and fixed, where the hand-scripted ones, each one, since it's a script unique to this situation, each one, you fix it, and you still have to fix all the others because they have their own scripts too. Plus, you're often restricted if there's a particular dialogue for this quest since dialogues get localized into other languages early and get locked. You often can't change those, so if you have a unique scripted solution that involves dialogue, you're going to have to find those bugs early, which is another reason I say try to keep it systemic.

Stories that try too hard to force the player to do one thing or go one way and solve it in a particular way make players feel railroaded.

 And in an RPG where players, in theory, you're saying, "Hey, you get to play how you want. You get to make up a character in your head and play them the way you want," you want to give them a lot of options. If you force them to play a certain way, if the only way to do a quest is this one solution, especially if it's a main quest, if it's a side quest, they're like, "I'm not going to do it," or if the only my only option is to kill all those goblins, "I'm just not going to do it." But if it's the main quest, and they've decided to be a pacifist, and you're making them kill every goblin to rescue that merchant, that's going to feel really, really bad. So that's why I say try to add something else, have the quest you can do for them, or let you bribe them because that's a way that pacifist player has of getting through there.

So, I guess the bottom line here is, set up situations with multiple ways through them, tell the player a goal, and then just let the events unfold any way they want. Now, that alone is a cool way of doing an RPG, but if you account for the different ways the player can do it, if you just keep a record, it can be an achievement, it can be a dialogue choice, it could be a flag that some script sets when it notices that the player did something, and then later on, and later on in the story, you can have NPCs refer to those flags, so they can change what they say. If you want to make an endgame story, an end slide that changes based on what the player did in the story, that's even better because, A, that tells the player the game is really watching me, and the game is changing, and I get to be who I want, and that changes my game compared to my friend's game, but also, it adds so much replayability. You get to the end of the game, thanks Windows, you get to the end of the game, and you're like, "I'm going to play that again, and this time, I'm going to save that merchant. I'm not going to let him die, or I'm not going to sell that quest item. I'm going to turn it in," because it's just that that's fun. That's role-playing games to me, and I think if you focus on that, I think you have a much better story.

So, Moji XOXO, I hope that's the best answer I can give on how gameplay can influence stories by just making those stories goal-based and not event-based. So, I hope that answers your question.
Title: 
Games Without End & New Game Plus

Youtube Link:
https://youtu.be/SmYBsCOp-OY?si=JpvgaUKMeEkbG6lS

Hi everyone, it's me Tim. Today I want to talk about game endings and new game plus—two different things, they're kind of related. I'll explain why. I have two different questions I'm answering here. I'll talk about the first one, talk for a bit, and then when I talk about new game plus, I'll bring in the other person who asked the first one. The first one is from Ian Akamoto, who writes:

> Would love to hear your thoughts on games that end and return the player to the menu upon completing the main quest line versus games that allow the player to continue playing on. Wondering if you favor a specific camp and how a developer might approach this choice.

Okay, I think it's pretty obvious that I favor the game-ending choice since it's pretty much what my games all do. Um, part of the reason I did this is when you have an ending, that's when you can do the reactivity that you can't do in-game. Like, I like the idea that people make choices in my game and have immediate reactions from people: this shopkeeper won't sell to you, this guy doesn't like you, a companion leaves the group. Those are immediate, but the end slides are things that are far more distant in time, like because you did this, this town became a political force over the next two decades; because you did this, everybody eventually moved away from the village and the village collapsed; because you did this, this demon is loose and it's going to wreak havoc all over the countryside until maybe another more daring adventuring party puts it down. These are like about end slides; it kind of tells the player, I saw what you did, I see the choices you made. Do you realize that some of them aren't immediate, some of the consequences, some of the consequences are long term? Own them. So, because of that, it lets me have that kind of reactivity, short and long term, that I want, but also having a game end very much encourages replayability. When you play a game, and you're getting your choice and consequence, you're getting your immediate consequences, and then you see those long-term consequences, a lot of players are like, I'm going to play again, and this time I'm going to be this class, or I'm going to take these skills, I'm going to do something different with this group, or I'm going to join this group, or I'm going to kill this group. It's fun, especially when you have a game that has such reactivity. They're like fun game toys that let you play with them.

Now, I do occasionally find myself leaning towards the idea of designing a game where you can keep playing after you finish the main quest line, but I'm going to give two big caveats to developers who select this choice. First of all, you have to bear in mind that if you are going to have content past the main quest line ending, and you want to show reactivity in that content, you're going to spend money to do this. So whoever's giving you the money, publisher, Kickstarter, whatever, they should probably agree that that's what you're doing because you will spend money on this. It will affect your production, it will affect your bug fixing and polishing phases at the end, it will affect everything. In fact, let me give you the second caveat, which is a pre-production thing. You need, if you want to have a game where the player reaches the end and can keep playing, you need to have planned for that and designed for that from the very start of your game, from the very beginning of you designing that game. Remember I said, it goes setting, story, system, mechanics. You're saying you want story to end but the player to continue, and maybe some side quests, I'm assuming, are going to be in there. This will affect your system mechanics. Um, people have mentioned this in the comments, got some smart people in the comments, and they've said, hey, you know, you can keep letting people level up without a level cap, you just have to design for it, and you're absolutely right. If you don't plan to have people continue playing your game after they finish the main quest line, and then somebody goes, eh, let's just get rid of the level cap, or the ending, and let's let people keep playing, not only are they going to go to places that don't react to what they've just done, like you've killed the big baddy, and you're going back to town, so they're like, hey, welcome back to town, do you want to buy this vase I have? And you're like, I just took out the big baddy. So, that's a lot of new dialogue that you should probably write. There's probably, um, level design you have to change to account for it. It's like, oh, now that the big bad's gone, maybe certain places are different, maybe the curse is lifted from this place, maybe the tomb no longer requires a special key to enter because it's flung open. Um, these are things that you just have to do. But probably the most important thing is, if you're just going to let people keep playing and playing, and especially if you take the level cap off, you're going to have to redesign your system mechanics because otherwise, people keep gaining levels, buying perks, upping their attributes, upping their skills, eventually they're just going to have everything. You're eventually going to run out of things to buy if that's the way you're designing your game, and there's going to be walking gods. They're going to have every attribute at max, every skill at max, every perk except maybe the few that say you can't have these two perks together. That's going to be ridiculous. So, people have suggested diminishing returns, which is, once a skill, say, goes over 100, you can keep adding to it, but it only increases, say, your, let's say you have an archery skill, and it increases your to-hit with the bow, maybe after 100, instead of it going up 1% with every skill point, it goes up 1% for every five skill points, and then it starts going up 1% for every 10, and then every 20, and then every 50, and then every 100. You can still get a 200, 400, 1,000 archery skill, but it takes more and more points to get any effect out of it. There's no upper limit, in theory, you could keep playing, but the game knows that, okay, eventually, it's going to top out, probably in a reasonable number of hours, a few thousand hours, that you, you can design it to have an asymptotic curve, so it approaches 200%, and you know it's not going to go over that. Then you can start planning for, oh, what happens when someone has an archery skill of 200%? You know, maybe they, maybe you cap, um, there's still always a one in 20 or one in 30 or one in 50 chance of missing. Maybe the extra damage that you get, um, maybe once you go over a certain percentage to hit, it starts increasing the

 critical chance, but the effects of critical still are things like extra damage, possibility of knockdown, those don't change, it's just you get them more frequently. So, there are ways to design for playing past, playing with no level cap, and continuing playing the game past the main storyline, but you have to account for it from the beginning. So, that's my answer to Ian Akamoto.

But I did get questions about New Game Plus that kind of feel the same in the same area of design to me, so let me explain that. Greg Peterson 5857 asks:

> How do you feel about New Game Plus, where you can import endgame character back into the beginning of the game with some combination of experience, items, and money? Any ideas and suggestions on how to do that well and keep things interesting?

Okay, let me caveat this with, I've never done that. I like it, I think it's interesting. I could probably do a whole video on different ways to do that, but I've never done it, so I'd be speaking incredibly theoretically and no experience at all. Um, I will talk about some things I would do. First of all, new game plus, you have to remember, you have to play the game entirely once to unlock it. This will be important in a minute, but also, yes, the world is completely reset. Maybe, maybe there's a few things that don't reset, like, well, let's talk about this. If you don't reset everything on the player, if he keeps to, if the player gets to keep some percentage of their XP or their items or attributes or skills or perks or flaws, some per, you can also consider not resetting all the world. Like, maybe the world resets but randomizes, so those 20 gems you had to go find are now in different places, or maybe the world resets and it's a slightly different villain, or the villain has slightly different skills or attributes, so you don't know exactly what you're going to do. So, the world, when you say the world is reset, there's different ways you can do that. When you say the player keeps some of their XP, items, and purchased attributes and skills, there's different ways you can do that. You can get rid of all of it and just give them the XP, or some portion of their XP, so they have to start rebuilding a character, but they get to buy some things at the beginning that they couldn't in a non-new game plus, or you can just restore all their XP, so they're basically restarting, they finished at a level 20, they're starting as level 20, but they don't have their items or anything like that. Maybe, not usually, achievements aren't reset, and sometimes I see achievements for doing new game plus stuff, so there's a million ways you can do that. Um, so I guess my answer is, I've never done this, and while I could do a whole video, it really depends on how you handle it. I see so many ways of doing New Game Plus that it'd be hard to lock down to one of them, and it's really dependent on how you've already done your designs. So, if this sounds like another one of mine, one of my, uh, it depends answers, it really is, it depends on a lot of things you've already done. Um, but one thing I can see about New Game Plus is occasionally features get locked behind it, like, until you do new game plus, you can't maybe you can't play a particular class, or maybe there's a race that's quite different than the others, and you can't earn playing until New Game Plus. I'm of two minds on this. It's like, I don't really like letting player not have choice, um, at the beginning, but if New Game Plus is something, it's the hook you want to hang your hat on for your game, I could see doing this. I could also see using New Game Plus as a way to call out features in the game that you don't think are really necessary to the game but you added for fun. Maybe there's, um, a weird skill, or maybe there are some weird perks that make the game feel a little differently, so you not lock up behind New Game Plus and say, you can only choose to unlock this once you've played the game in the vanilla method. I'll give you an example. When we did all the weird encounters in Fallout, and then later on, people were like, oh, well, I guess aliens are canon. I, you know, and I'm like, I'm not sure you can assume that, because I don't really think we intended time lords to be canon, or Godzilla to be canon. That would have been more clear if we had hidden that behind a new game plus, that you have to play Fallout once, and then we unlock the crazy encounters on the map. It'd be like, uh, Fallout New Vegas, the Wild Wasteland perk. Maybe it just says, you can't buy that until you've played the game once without it and finished it. And that would be the designer telling you, I know you want this, and I think it's fun to play the game like this, but I don't consider it canon, and I think you should at least experience the game canonically before you start making adjustments. It's almost like a mod that the designer included in the game. It's like, your game comes pre-modded, but please play it without the mod first. That's kind of how I see another way of handling New Game Plus. But like I said, I've never done that, so that's probably all I can talk about New Game Plus for, from how I would design it, standpoint, Greg Peterson 5857. And I hope I answered your question about playing past the end of the main story quest, Ian Nakamoto.

Giving Good Feedback.md
Youtube Link:

https://youtu.be/-72btgrwKzA?si=B8v9VBChf30YPW2L

Hi everyone, it's me Tim. Today, I want to answer another question, this time from Brooke Richardson 1373, who asks, "Can you do a video on giving good and relevant game design feedback, and how do we know when things aren't balanced?" This is a good question because this is effectively what I do now as a semi-retired design consultant. What I'm effectively asked to do from companies that I work for is give them good and relevant design feedback. So, I've talked a lot about making sure this is actionable, but let's do a deep dive into exactly what I mean about how to create that feedback, how to deliver it, and then I'll try to touch a bit more on the second question about balancing.

So first, it's really important if you're going to give feedback to someone about a game to know exactly what it is they're making. And I know that sounds dumb, but let me walk through what I mean by that. Or it sounds obvious. First of all, you have to read all of their design docs. I would, at the very minimum, read what's called the GDD, the general design doc, which covers everything: setting, story, tone, the mechanics they want to use, planned encounter, what kind of creatures they want to put in, items they're going to give. It's important to kind of have a good grasp of the game they say they're making. And if you've watched my video on design pillars, I think it's really important that they have these design pillars. I will look for them. If they don't have them, I will ask them if they have them. If they don't, I will ask someone to verbally give them to me, just tell me what it is your goals are for this game, what are you trying to make, summarize your whole game into three or four design pillars, things that everything I look at should somehow be relevant to those pillars. I don't get a lot of pushback on this because once I explain what I'm trying to ask for, people tend to give them. I think once I got some pushback where they were like, "Well, we're fast and loose, and you know, we play things by gut," and I'm like, "Okay, then my design feedback will also be fast and loose and based more on feeling than comparison to design pillars and other games."

The next thing I do that's really important is I frequently get invited to meetings, and I try to go. I try to listen more than I talk at those meetings, especially at team meetings and level design meetings where they're talking about, at the team meetings they tend to go over the high-level events like, "This is coming up," or "We just finished this thing," and that will give me an idea of when I play the game what to look for because certain things have been listed as, "Well, this is complete," or "We have a good handle on this, great." But I also like level design meetings where they're actually putting together particular levels. I like them at all the stages. I like them early when they're just rough layouts, gray level is what it's called, with cubes and untextured objects, and that's when you talk about sight lines to points of interest, you talk about are the spaces big enough, you're going to have a big combat here but it's a little narrow hallway. You look for things like space. Are there alternatives? That's the time to go, "Well, you said there's a stealth path, but I don't see any way past this hallway other than fighting these things." That's when you talk about things that if you were to say that later, after the level is put together and art's gone through it and lighting's made its pass and narrative's gone in and added narrative to all the people, that is not the time to go, "I think we should rearrange this level and move these creatures over here and change this space," because by then so much work has gone into it that you're really wasting their time. So, I try to get in early on those meetings and give them very actionable stuff, like, "I think this may not be big enough," or "This is a big empty space and nothing is going on here." I also look for places to do what are called L dumps, which I've mentioned sometimes games just do it from characters, but I prefer it to be like, "Oh, you found a computer, and you can look something up on it," or "You found this book or this note." And this is where I think Bethesda does it really well, the level itself, the layout, the props, and things you find in it tell a story. This is a good time to point out where in the level that would be good to do.

So, the second thing I do now that I think I know what game they're making, the second thing I do is I think about what games that are already out that are relevant to the one they're making. So, I will ask them, "What do you think are similar games to yours?" I will play them if I haven't, even if it just means grabbing the game and playing it for a few hours. If it's hard to get, like, I still own a really old PC, it's like 7 years old, and I don't have a PlayStation, if it's a game that's like exclusive or requires an advanced graphics card to even get a decent frame rate, I'll just go and watch one of my favorite reviewers and watch them play through the game. Another reason, by the way, I like Mortismal, he reviews games usually when he's done 100%, so I can get a good feel for what the game is like throughout the play. There are some games that start strong and then get weak. There are some games that start kind of muddled, and then you can tell they found their voice, they found their tone well into the game. So, I like to watch good reviewers, reviewers who seem to match my temperament and critique style, and I see what they thought about those games.

So, once I've seen all these relevant games, then I make some comparisons. I'm like, "Hey, you're doing this thing, they did it, and it led to this problem. Do you have an idea of how to solve that? Here are some ideas I have on how to solve that." And by the way, that leads me right to my third point, which is always try to craft actionable feedback. Actionable feedback are things that when they hear it, they can immediately do something. So, because of that, I try to avoid saying, "I like this feature, I hate that feature," because that not only is that not relevant, but it's also not helpful, and that's 99% of the comments you see online from people who fashion themselves as game critique individuals. They go, "I hate this, like that, didn't like that, not helpful." Instead, what I try to do is I go through their features that they have called out as their big features, and I match them to their design pillars, and I'll say, "Well, you say that conversing with NPCs is important, but you have an entire level where there's not a single NPC you can talk to," or "You say that

 your game is strong in its lore, but I don't see a lot of lore that I can find in this game. There's a lot of interesting things, I see ruins and interesting magic items, and I don't know anything about them, and there's absolutely nothing written." Sometimes I'll be told, "Oh, that'll come later, that'll come later," and I'll say, "Okay, but mark that as something that has to be done because if you don't do it, it's going to feel lacking. Either that or change your design pillar, stop saying you're a deep lore-based game." Just those things should match. This is a place where I do go with my gut in order to create the actionable feedback. I will, while I'm playing their game, and this is another great thing, is a lot of companies I'm working for have prototypes and early versions of their games already available to be played. So, I will play them, and I will pay attention to, is there any particular area I'm drawn to? Is there any particular thing I'm confused by? And you have to remember that early on in the game, there are things that you're going to be confused by just because they're not done yet, or supporting features aren't there yet, like things may be dropping recipes, but there's no crafting system, so you can't review that yet. But you can say, "Hey, I'm getting recipes, when's the crafting system going online? I'd really like to know if I'm getting recipes and ingredients fast enough, and if they're easy to find, and there's enough crafting stations available in the world for me to use." This is also a time where I try to look for things at features and go, "This is fun, this is novel, I've never seen anything like this," or "This feature is great and isn't being used enough." These are are things you can say, but then if you say something's fun, you should say why you found it to be fun. "Oh, it matched your pillar, this pillar. I really loved crafting, it gave me really useful items, and it was fun to go look for the ingredients." That's much better than going, "Your crafting is good." If you have new, if I like to point out any new and novel features I see in the game, I think that's something that not only makes the designers feel good, but one time recently, in a game I was previewing, I saw a feature being used, and I said to them, "Not only have I not seen this anywhere, I think you could make a whole game around this one feature," which is both a good and bad thing to say. It's good in the sense that they could really push on that feature hard, and I think the game would be known for that feature. However, if that's not what they intended, if they're not trying to make a game about that thing, well, that's the way they're headed, so they may want to consider modifying the feature or taking it out unless they want to make a game that's all about that. So sometimes, you can find a feature that's so good, you have to tell them, "I think you either need to double down on this or get rid of it because this is going to make or break your game, or people are going to pay attention to this more than your other features because it's just so fun and useful."

Finally, when you're giving feedback, it's okay to ask questions. You're at an early stage of game development. They don't always expect you to provide a solution to the problem, but they at least expect you to point in the direction of one. When you say, "I don't understand this," or "I have some concerns," they would like to know. And this is where questions come in. For example, let's say you're playing an early version of a game, and this amazing weapon drops, it's all you use. You're like, "This is so much better, it does more damage, it shoots faster, it shoots farther, it's more accurate." Yes, they can say, "Well, we plan to balance that later," and that's one of your questions, "What are you going to do to balance this? Are you going to reduce one of those things? If you're going to nerf something, is it going to be inaccurate, is it going to going to reduce the range? Are you going to take some of those things that it's really good at and lock them behind perks so players have to specialize their character to make this the best weapon in the game?" To show how you can go down the rabbit hole with that, let's say you go, "Well, maybe you should limit ammo for it." By making ammo is something that maybe the ammo is very expensive for this weapon, so using this weapon is a one of the game's defined money sinks, or maybe you can say ammo is only dropped by content that we want the player to get involved in. We call it aspirational content. So maybe there are creatures we want you to kill, or maybe there are quests we want you to do, and those things reward you with the ammo. That kills drop that ammo, that quest rewards you with that ammo, and because that's your favorite weapon, you're like, "Oh good, I have to go kill 50 of those guards, or I have to go finish this quest for the prince, and he will give me that ammo." Great, it's a great thing to do. So, you can see that you're not telling them, "Here's how you solve the problem with that weapon," but you're pointing out, "This weapon is so good, the way it's designed, that's all anyone's ever going to use."

Finally, let me get to the last part of the question, because wow, I'm talking a lot. Balance. Balance is not my strong suit. I've said that. If you don't believe me, go play some of my games. I don't always go for balance because I usually prioritize fun over balance, and I don't mind if some player builds are overbalanced. I don't mind if some weapons tend to be overbalanced. What I look for is not being able to finish the game with a particular build. So, in this case, for balance, I do two things. I lean hard on two things. First of all, I lean hard on QA. They're playing the game a lot. Like I've said in other videos, I like to have a good relationship with the lead of QA, talk to him a lot, ask him a lot of questions. I want to know where the game feels too easy or too hard. I want to know if there are weapons or perks that people in QA are just getting all the time because they view that as the best one. Are there any that they're not? Are they going, "Oh yeah, never buy that perk, never get that trait, or that's a dump stat"? I may or may not change that because it may be that well, those are really good for one particular kind of build, but I'm at least going to listen to it and take it into account when I go do balancing.

Another thing that I really love doing, and you have to have time for this, and

 you have to have a programmer who's willing to do this with you, is tracking data. Tracking data is where the game stores information on what the player did. Now, you're probably doing this already if you're doing an achievement system. In Outer Worlds, we were doing it for achievements and for Flaws because remember, flaws were rewarded based on, "Oh, your character just did something, maybe we want to give you a flaw based on that." What tracking data can help you in balancing is you can look at like what weapons or armor are being used frequently, what weapon and armor are never being used. Where in the game do the players tend to die frequently? This is stuff you can look on, and it's what I love about it, is unlike the QA stuff, it is guaranteed to be objective. QA may say they really like a weapon a lot. The tracking data will tell you, okay, everybody playing this game, QA and people who are, you know, developers who are just playing through the game to test it, this is the one they're using a lot, and you may ask why, and you may find out, "Oh, it's a good testing weapon because it's overall generally just very good, and I'm just running through doing testing." That's fine, but if you find everyone keeps getting this one shotgun in the game, you can go, "Why is that?" You can dive down, you can ask people, and you can figure out, "Oh, I think I need to balance this. This shotgun is a little too good."

Okay, I hope that answered your question, Brooke, on how to give good feedback and some techniques on balancing the game.

GNW & TIG, My OS Abstraction Libraries.md
Youtube Link:
https://youtu.be/hZEosFcqmcU?si=8mCJYBuH-qe--uzh

Hi, it's me, Tim. Today I want to talk about gnaw and Tig. That's gnaw, GNW, and Tig, T-I-G. These are operating system abstraction libraries that I wrote in the 90s to basically hide away all the ugliness and inconsistencies and just kind of dumbness of the operating systems on various microcomputers at the time. So let me explain why I'm talking about this. I know I mentioned yesterday when I was talking about Rags to Riches, I mentioned, you know, I've done, I've mentioned going on taking previous videos, so I kind of want to walk through what I did, and I promise you there are fun anecdotes that have nothing to do with programming.

So back when I was doing my gerps apps, I did them in super VGA, and it was my first foray into it. It wasn't, you know, professional, but I wanted to learn how it worked. That's when I first started having to do the bank switching. To remind you, bank switching is the way memory is mapped on a PC. You could write into PC memory, and it would appear on the screen, but the size of the memory was only 64k, but you needed a lot more than that for super VGA. So they invented bank switching, so you'd write into that 64k memory, it would go up on the screen in a certain portion, and then you could bank switch, and it would move where the memory on the PC was mapped to the screen, so you could, that's the only way you could draw anywhere on the screen you wanted. Bank switching was a pain. It required assembly code, it was different for every video card. I just really wanted it to not be something I had to think about every day, so I wrote a little library called grlib for graphics library, and grlib encapsulated the bank switching, and I used that for my gerps apps. So when I started doing Rags to Riches, I already had something like that, and I started expanding it because, for the gerps apps, I think I used the mic, the windows mouse drawing routines, but on Rags to Riches, we wanted our own mouse, so I had to draw it myself, mouse pointer on the screen. So this meant that when I went to go draw the mouse pointer, it also had to understand bank switching, and so I'm like, so I moved all the mouse routines into this library I had. Well, that was for moving mouse and drawing it. Well, when you press the mouse, it and it would, you'd get a, you know, a click or double click, I moved that in there as well. So that meant there was an input event queue. There was a whenever I would see one of these events, I throw in the queue, so the game could then look at that queue and go, oh look, there's a mouse click here at this location or double click at this location. Well, once I had that, it occurred to me, well, I should probably do keyboard events the same way, and for keyboard events, it was like, you know, if you hold a key down, I wanted to know that, if you released it, I wanted to know that, if the key was held down, so it started repeating the letter, I wanted to know that. So I put all that in there, and that all went into this event queue. So now this library is more than just video drawing, bank switching, it was mouse and keyboard abstraction, and an event queue, and then that's when I realized, I'm dos, which is what all this was written for, they only provided a timer that I did think did a tenth of a second, which was not enough to do animations if you wanted a 30 frames per second game or 60 frames per second game. A tenth of a second timer is not enough. There was a millisecond timer, but it needed assembly. I didn't want ugly assembly in my beautiful C code, so again, that library was expanded, and now there was a millisecond timer in there. That's pretty much the state it was when I did Rags to Riches. It was a library that I just tried to hide things in, so my game code for Rags to Riches what didn't look messy.

When I started making engines after Rags shipped, engine one of which would become Fallout, I actually formalized all this. I took all those different abstractions, and I smooshed them together in one library called Ganahl, GNW. It stood for "Ganas Not Windows." Yes, it was front-end recursive because that's how programmer humor rolls. I was really excited about Ganoa because suddenly, once I had everything in there and you can always by itself compiling, it had all the Dos stuff in there, my code looked very clean and operating system independent. To test this, uh, Krista Salvo, the guy who stayed up all night with me while we were doing, well, I was coding rags to riches, and he was helping me, he said I'll do a Mac version or test your theory. He took Ganah home over one weekend, came back in with pretty much ninety percent of gnaw Mac. I think I remember color cycling wasn't working because Max handled color palettes differently, but most of it was, and we took that Mackinaw, and we recompiled what was then the very early Fallout code to run on a Mac, and it worked. We had Fallout running on a Mac like that. Chris Jones later took The Gnome code and made a Windows version of it, so we could run on Windows 95. and he did that in a few weeks, which meant we now had Fallout running on Mac and windows and dos, and I don't say it was free, but it was a lot easier to make those extra ones than what other people had dealt with in the past. So I started sharing and all with other teams. I know the Star Trek team used it, Max, uh, the mecca mechanized armored exploration game, there are several of the Sim game, simant, sim Earth, SimCity, we were making SimCity 2000, and those all used them. It was interesting because I had regular meetings with the executive producer, and he told me not to waste my time because no one reused software, and I said, well, you've already got five or six projects here that are using it and are dependent on my library, so I'm gonna keep doing it.

Now, a lot of funny things happened about um, but one of the funniest ones was, I think it was marketing, someone decided we should have a Windows 95 sticker on the box for Fallout. I know I've told this story in the GDC talk, so we submitted it, and I was like, this is gonna pass easy because we are completely Windows 95, in fact, we're generic Windows compliant, so I was shocked when it came back unapproved, and I read through the report, and the reason for the unapproval was it ran on Windows NT. Like, what does that have to do with anything? So I remember talking, I called the uh, testing place, and I talked to someone, and she told me, yes, you're being, you're disqualified from the Windows 

95 logo or sticker or whatever it was on the front of the box, because you are supposed to degrade gracefully on Windows NT. To get that logo, you have to degrade gracefully on Windows and T, and I said, we degrade the most gracefully of all, we run flawlessly. She said, nope, that's not what we mean. It's not supposed to work. I was like, why would you want it not to work? Because if you want the logo, you have to make it not work, and I was like, I don't really care about the logo, so oh well. So I was just prepared to Let It Go, but someone, and I don't remember who, someone in interplay was like, no, we're getting that logo. So I didn't want to put anything in the game that would go like, your windows and T, don't work, so I asked Chris Jones to put that code in the installer, so if you're attempted to install Fallout on Windows NT, it would go, nope, that's an invalid Target operating system. Here's where it got funny, my experience writing critical error handlers on stonekeep had shown me that there were some CD-ROMs out there that were terrible. They would just not read data, or they'd sometimes read it and sometimes not, especially if near the edges, the outer edge or the inner edge of the CD, or the outer rim, or the area near the spindle, sometimes it wouldn't read it correctly, so you'd have to read it multiple times, and I had that code in Fallout, but I realized that if people ever had trouble during installation with data reading, it would be a lot easier if there was some method of just doing it by hand. So there was a way of installing Fallout by bypassing the installer by just taking the DAT file and copying it by hand to your hard drive, and then copying over the executable for dos or Windows or Mac, whatever you're going to run, and just run that, and that would work. Turns out we could do that, we suggested that to people for NT, we're like, oh, is the installer not working for you, just copy it by hand, it'll work. So we got the logo, people with winning T had an alternative way of installing it, everybody was happy. The irony was, Windows 95 got phased out, and all the windows starting with Windows 2000 going forward were all Windows NT based, so the installer wouldn't work for them. Luckily, you could just hand copy it, and Fallout continues to be run to this day. Later, when I was running my own company at Troika, I learned my lesson, and I remember, I left all the code behind, I rewrote an entire library called TIG, TIG, which stood for TIG isn't Ganahl. So Not only was it forward and back, front letter and back letter recursive, but TIG did a lot more than what Ganahl did. TIG handled bit debts, any bit depth you wanted, so you could do 640, 40, 24 bit, 32-bit color, it handled memory, you could have it handle memory for you, or you could say, hey, I've made my own buffers, here they are for my windows, it just did a lot more stuff. um, side note, at one point when interplay thought I had stolen code, I invited them over, Fergus came over with a programmer, and they went through all my TIG code, and the pro, I still remember, the programmer looked at Ferg and said, this is totally brand new, this isn't anything from Ganahl, in fact, it's better. I kind of wish we could do some of this stuff. Funny time.

But here's the thing, I just want to throw out there, because of taking all, it's very easy to port games like Fallout and Arcanum because they're not operating system dependent. I was curious about this a few months ago, so I took Arcanum because I have the source code, and I recompiled it on a modern C compiler for Windows 10 and whatever version of DirectX we're up to now, and it works. I have Arcanum running on Windows 10 as a native app. If I can do that to Arcanum, anybody can do that to Fallout because Fallout's based on Ganahl, you make, you bring all up to modern spec, and you should be able to recompile the whole thing for whatever operating system you want, Windows 11, Windows 12, whatever's coming down the pipe. That's why I made that because I didn't want to have to deal with operating systems and they're being upgraded. So I'm hoping something like that happens. I'm not going to do it, but my experiment with Arcanum proves that it's possible. So going forward, whenever I talk about Fallout or Rags to Riches or Arcanum or Temple, you're going to hear me throw out the words Ganahl and Tig, that's what I'm talking about. And that's my programming video for a while.

Good Team Characteristics.md

https://youtu.be/SrAuoqdl0os?si=t9Wns8J77hiwav_w

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim, and today I want to talk about people I like working with. This is an interesting question from postal 0311 who asks, "Could you please tell us about the characteristics of the people you enjoyed working with, the characteristics of the people you felt helped you achieve the most? Basically, what can we do and act to be better team members in a project?" That is a great, great question. And he even said don't name people, and I'm not going to because even though this is a good thing, he wants to know about what characteristics there are, you know, how did people act that made me go, "This is fantastic. I wish more people acted this way. The game is better because of this." And even more importantly, sometimes for me, making the game was more enjoyable because I got to work with people like this.

I thought about this for a while. I chewed on it. I thought of people I liked working with. I thought of what they shared in common. And I should say, like, there are people I've worked with in the past, and we made a good game, but I'm not sure I want to work with them again. And there were people I never got to work with that I watched working on other games that I wished I had worked with them. There were people, there are friends of mine that I've even told some of them, "You and I couldn't work together," and it's because we're just very different.

So don't view this as, you know, my guide to people you have to, characteristics you have to find in people, but these are things that make me happy to work with people, and I think make better games, at least when you're making them with me. So I've got five things. They are not in order. I hate giving things in order. Some people argue about the order. So these are just randomly thrown out there, the five things that I like most about people, characteristics about people that makes me like working with them.

The first one, I like working with smart people. I've mentioned this before. Going through high school and college, as the pond got bigger and turned into an ocean, I discovered I really liked working with smart people. Smart people are just clever, and I know that sounds synonymous because someone accused me once, "If you only like working with college folks," and I'm like, "No, I don't." It's, there was so much wrong with what they said that it made me look at them differently, like, wow, this is a chip that you carry on your shoulder because I could give so many examples of just clever, smart people I worked with who didn't go to college. The tech director at Interplay, a ton of people on The Fallout team, and at Troika, a college degree doesn't necessarily make you clever; it just makes you educated, and those are different things.

But what I mean by smart is, I like working with people who can think of solutions. We run into a problem, and they're like, "Well, we could try this; we could do this." And what I like about that is, I've worked with so many people who thought of better things than I did, and I've mentioned them here. It's like, the ending of Fallout was much better than my ending. The tech schematics on Arcanum were way better than my tech skills. So these are things that I think, just in my career, I've realized other people are going to have better ideas than you, so try to get smart people on the team because you are going to run into situations that you can't figure out a solution, and if you work with a bunch of smart people, chances are you find something.

Which brings me to a related characteristic, but I put it in a separate category, so the second thing I like working with people, the characteristics I look for, is if they're proactive. And by that, I mean a proactive person notices that there's a problem in the game or a process that's in, that, you know, maybe one of the asset pipelines, or maybe the development process itself, and they bring it up, and they offer to fix it. This is different than being clever because I've worked with people who said, "Hey, I noticed a problem here. I'm not sure how to fix it, but I wanted to bring it up," as opposed to people who literally would never do such a thing. I had to give a review at the end of the year to someone on one of the teams I had, and I literally said, sat him down and said, "You do a fantastic job when I ask you to, but you recently started asking me about getting a promotion, and I've had to tell you every single time that you are so non-proactive. You're simply reactive that I can't, in good conscience, give you a promotion, and I've given you examples, so here we are sitting in a review at the end of the year where I've said this to you throughout the year, and you have not done it." In fact, I think I told him, I said, "You're the type of person who will sit in a room that is on fire and will do nothing about it until I step in and go, 'The room's on fire. Do you mind putting the fire out?' And then you jump up, you throw buckets of water on things, you get a fire extinguisher, and you put that fire right out. But you won't do it until you're told." And the problem with promoting you is the next position you want requires you to notice these things and fix them before the place burns down.

So that proactivity is different than being smart. Proactivity is noticing there are problems and bringing it up, and even offering to be the person to fix it, even if someone else thinks of the solution. That's proactive. I like working with proactive people. It's probably not going to be a surprise what my third one is, but I like working with passionate people. And I've mentioned before that that's kind of become a negative adjective in this industry, but look, bottom line is, I would rather work with someone who's good at what they do but is very excited about doing it than someone who's great at what they do who really doesn't care one way or the other. It's more fun to work with a passionate person. It's more exciting. I think that when people are passionate about what they're doing, it shows through in the work they do. I'm sure you've all played games that are technically fine, but they just don't do anything for you. You're like, "I don't understand. This game doesn't have bugs, and these quests are working, and I made a character that had attributes I like, but why am I feeling absolutely nothing about this game?" And sometimes, I think that just chalks down to Passion, chalks up to Passion. It's due to Passion.

When I look back on some of my games, they're games that I loved making, even when they didn't sell well or review well, and I think it fell down to I worked with a team that I loved, and I loved them because they were passionate. Everybody was just working so hard and doing stuff they loved and was really into

 it. And it's when you work with a team that isn't like that, it's night and day. And I would rather make a game that reviewed eh and sold eh, but that I super enjoyed making, then even making a blockbuster that was Agony to make. I know a lot of people don't feel that way; they'd rather have that Blockbuster, but it is soul-draining to work on a game with a team that just doesn't give a hoot.

That brings to my fourth thing, and I've done a whole video on the biggest lesson I had to learn in the industry, is that people would lie to me. So I'm going to have to throw in honesty as a characteristic I look for in people I work with. I just want people to tell me things. "I don't like this feature. I don't think this is fun. I think we should reprioritize these elements." When people lie about some of those things, when they're pushing something because not because they think it's good but because a friend made it, or they tell me they like something even though they hate it because they want to be on my good side, I don't like that. I had two incidents that happened on a game that kind of show, and I know I didn't want to talk about the negative part of, but I'll show why honesty is important to me.

On the same game, I had someone lie to my face about something, and when I discovered it later, and I called him out on it, he said, "I was told to lie to you." And I was very confused at why he thought that made it better. You know, I said, "If I tell you to murder someone, you're not going to do it." So I don't know why you think being told by someone above you in the chain to lie to my face is something that's going to get you off the hook later. It ended up with me basically not talking to him for several months. I don't know if he noticed; I don't know if he cared. I do know that there were, in there were things that came up that we were supposed to work together that I just went, "Can't. I'm not available," and didn't say anything else.

So I don't know if people viewed that as Petty, but for me, it was a complete lack of trust in anything that guy was going to tell me. I just, I couldn't believe anything that would come out of his mouth. And then a similar thing that happened on the same project, I told people to let me know if something, if, if something changed in an area because it was an important area of the game. Came in, like I used to tell you, I come in the morning and play the game every morning, came in one morning, and that thing was changed, and I was like, "What?" I mean, I have access to Perforce, saw who changed it, went to the, uh, person who is in charge of managing those things, and said, "What happened here?" I didn't want to go talk to the person who put it in; I wanted to talk to the person who scheduled it to go in. And I said, "What happened here?" And he goes, "Oh, you noticed that." Like, "Of course I noticed it." And he said, "Well, I was told to put it in." And it was Again by someone above both of us. And I was like, "But you were, I told you to let me know." And he goes, "He told me not to tell you that." And I'm like...

So, and he said, "So I didn't lie to you." So he thought not telling me something was not as bad as lying to me about it. And keep in mind, this is something I was going to notice, and it was going to come up. And again, it was a complete trust breaker. And I even told him, "I understand that you are in a bad situation, that somebody above both of us told you not to tell me something that you know you should have told me, but I hope this means, going forward, I don't trust you." And I mean, he was broken. And I was like, I had to tell him. He goes, he said, asked me, "What do you mean by that?" And I said, "Every day, I'm going to look at Perforce check-ins on anything that you're responsible for scheduling, and I'm going to confirm that it's something that I knew was on the schedule and that was done the way I had approved of. And if I find a problem again, you and I are going to have issues." So I don't care what anyone else tells you. If you put something in that's not what I said, you and I are going to talk. And if you tell someone that you're scheduling to put something in that isn't what I said, we're going to have a problem. And that put him in a very bad position, but I didn't know how else to trust him going forward. If I'm making a game, and I can't even know what's going into it, and keep in mind, once a game shifts, and people hold you responsible for everything that's in it, I don't know how I could have worked in an environment where people were putting things in and just not telling me, um, especially when there were things I said, "Let me know if something like this changes."

Which gives me to the fifth thing, which is sound going to sound similar to honesty, but it's communication. And here's how it's different. I like to work with people who are communicative with me, and that's not the same as honesty because I've worked with people who, why they don't lie, they just don't say anything. So you have a meeting, and you're discussing putting a feature in the game. They don't say anything. They don't like it; they don't want to work on it; they have a better idea, but they don't say anything. So this is different than being proactive, and this is different than being honest. These are people who just have zero communication skills. The biggest frustration I have with working like people like that is they never, ever think of themselves as being a problem. They always go, "Well, you know, I didn't say anything. I didn't say anything negative." Okay, let me flip that around, then. The reason I like working with communicative people is, even if what they're saying isn't something you agree with, it certainly gives you a perspective in the game that many of your players may have. It's when you work with people who tell you what they think about things and act as a good sounding board on that, that is way more, uh, respectful than just saying nothing because you feel like you just don't want to get involved. And I know there are people go, "I'm very introverted. I don't want to say that." There's a million ways you can do it. You can go say it to your lead and ask the lead to bring it up and not tell you. We often had ways. We had a lot of ways people could suggest things anonymously if they wanted to. But when I work on teams

 where there are just people who don't say anything, even when they're really good at what they do, afterwards, I find myself going, "I'd rather work on a team that communicated more, that talked more about the good stuff and the bad stuff than basically just sat quietly and said nothing." And then the game went out, and they were like, "It's funny." It's not proactivity; it's not passion; it's not honesty. It's literally wanting to work with people who will tell you how they think and how they feel. And I think the lack of talking is very different than people who lie to you or just are reactive to things.

So I hope that answers your question, postal 0311. And just to recap, I like working with smart, proactive, passionate, honest, communicative people. That's my best team.
Title: 
Grey Morality

Youtube Link:
https://youtu.be/HFDQkYVozwo?si=K6-eXmVzOff4rUL6

Hi everyone, it's me Tim. Today, I want to talk about gray morality. This has come up a lot in my games. It's the situation where you feel like you've been presented with a number of options to finish a quest, and there's really no right choice, and sometimes there's no wrong choice either. Both of them just lead to different things happening, none of which affect you or a lot of other people. And sometimes, it's hard to even describe whether there's a right or wrong choice because it's hard to define what's right or wrong.

Let's look at that perennial Fallout Quest, Gizmo versus Killian, in Junktown. If you remember that one, the player arrives at Junktown and quickly learns that the sheriff, Killian, is kind of in a standoff with Gizmo, the overweight owner of the local casino. Gizmo wants to expand; he wants to do a lot of other things. Killian basically believes that he's done a lot of immoral things and wants to take him down. He needs proof. You get involved in that, you know, evidence gathering, picking a side, and doing it. Now, this is a real choice that comes along in the game. The player's forced to choose one side; which side dies, basically.

Um, now interestingly enough, we to present that as no side being right. And I know that sounds strange because people are like, well, of course, Gizmo is evil; he's an amoral crime lord. Why would anyone pick with him? Well, Junktown is doing better because of his casino. It's bringing in caps; it's bringing in people. And so the original slide for that said that if you pick Gizmo, Junktown thrives; it becomes bigger, it does way better under him economically. Yes, yes, he's still a crime lord, yes he does questionable things, but most people are better off under him. Kilian, on the other hand, he's very fair and impartial, but he follows the letter of the law. And our original slide implied that Junktown does not do well under him. It suffers, mainly because justice is never as easy as a rulebook, and that's how Killian treats the law, you know, the most minor infraction must be punished horrifically.

So, that's how we wanted to do it, and the original slides, which you can look up online, um, were really harsh. We liked them, but we realized when we started play testing, and it came late, that there were no clues that that's how the, that those were the consequences for the player's actions. And a number of people who were playing the game in QA and on the team were saying, it really isn't fair that you get hit with such negative consequences when the game seems to be staring you towards Killian, and then punishes you for picking him.

So, by that time, we couldn't really add the clues we needed because Kilian and Gizmo were already uh, recorded and edited and in the game from their voice actors. I'm not even sure we could get them again, and it would have cost money to get them again, which we were out of. So, rather than change the VO, we change the end slides not to be as harsh. Also, we pointed out to everyone playing, you did not have to pick a side; you could walk away, you could leave Junktown and say this isn't part of my problem, and just be happy or indifferent to whatever happens there, knowing that you had nothing to do with it. They were fighting before you got there; they're going to be fighting after you leave. But you're the player character, and a lot of players are like, I need to intervene, which teaches you sometimes intervention, sometimes doing the action, is the wrong action. What's that War Games quote? Not playing is the correct move.

So, gray morality comes up again and again in my games. CU, I like it. I think it makes sense. I think it shows up a lot because this is how things go, not just in games but in life. And this has happened again and again on this channel, and it's interesting, the most comments I seem to get is when I tell a story that's very gray, and I try to be very gray about it, and immediately people take sides in it and start arguing in the comments. I mean, I was in a situation with no correct solution. Do I tell my boss who, whose bug made the game late and get that person in trouble, or do I say nothing and take the consequences for me, saying no to my superior? This is no different than my team member saying he was asked to add a feature to the game and not tell me. You know, he was faced with a choice: does he just go ahead and do that, knowing that I will find out about it, or does he say nothing and, um, or does he say nothing, I find out about, or does he tell me, risking our superior coming down on him? By the way, that feature caused a lockup bug in the game, so guess what, within 24 hours, everybody knew about that feature because, um, you had to be told to be careful what you did there because if you went in and backed out, it would lock up the game. So super ironic that it wasn't just me who was like, hey, what's this doing here?

So, what I love about those stories is some people took my side about not saying no to my superior, but then people took my team member's side for going giving in to the superior. And I'm not even saying which one of you guys is right. I'm saying life isn't fair; these situations arise. Me and my team member had nothing to do with those situations; it was a superior who caused them, and we had nothing we could do to make it right. In my case, that's why I chose to just double-check his work from now on until we shipped. Uh, it wasn't fair to him, but features going into the game that I would ultimately responsible for wasn't fair to me.

So, that's just, sometimes you just try to act ethically, you try to do the best thing you can do, and move on from that. So, I guess my point of this is, is you can make all the explanations you want for how you act, you know, you can say, I'm sorry, it was an order from a superior, I'm sorry, I needed this job, I'm sorry, I, I have a family, I have to support. You can say all those things, but don't pretend you made the right choice, because maybe both choices are wrong. But what you have to accept is once you made a choice on how to act, you are now part of the problem. It's why I said you could walk away in Junktown and say this is between Killian and Gizmo. That team member could have said, I, I can't do what you're saying; you're going to have to ask somebody else. And of course, that may have consequences too, but keep in mind that once you do the thing that you think is unethical, there's going to be consequences. You will be asked to do worse things later. Trust me, once you have a superior who

 asks you to do things that you think are a little unethical, once you do them, do you really think they're going to stop there? They're going to ask you to do more things and more things, and, and team members will lose trust in you once they find out you're doing these things, whether it affects them or not. Like I said, when that feature went in and it caused a lockup, and I was like, I have no idea what this is, where did this come from, a JIRA bug got written up. I think I wrote it up. Once we found out it came from the superior, I assigned it to him, and I said, this is your mess, clean it up. And he had to pass that on to the lead programmer to pass down to a programmer to fix, and now everybody knows why that feature was there, and that caused a trust problem. I did not cause that; my team member did not cause that; the superior caused that. However, we're responsible for the actions we take. I don't know if he regrets not telling me; I don't know if he regrets just not saying something to the super, but like, I don't want to do that. I regret him not doing that, and I feel completely responsible for checking his work from then on. We were only a few months from the end of the game. Okay, every day when I came in, I checked to see if any check-ins went in from any of the people under him, and I looked at them to make sure they were things that I'd actually asked for and was expecting to go into the game.

Just keep in mind that no matter what you choose to do, and even doing nothing is a choice, you're going to be held responsible for the consequences of what you did. So my recommendation here is, whether you're playing a game or whether you are in real life, pick the action that you want to do, the one that you're willing to accept the consequences for because once you do something because someone else told you, you're partially responsible now. You're now part of the problem, and any consequences that come down, they're yours. And like I said, you may have an explanation. I'm not going to even call it an excuse. You may have an explanation for why you did what you did, but don't pretend that it's an excuse, and don't pretend that you have now not become part of the problem.

So, gray morality, I love it in my games as long as it telegraphs the consequences. I don't like it in life, but it's unavoidable. So, for those of you making games, I hope that you consider putting some gray morality quests in your game. I think it makes games more interesting, certainly makes people talk about it. So, consider that when you're making multiple quest solutions, that sometimes you need to make a quest that doesn't have the right answer; it just has several different wrong answers.

Anyway, I hope you like that.

Hedonic Adaptation.md
Youtube Link:
https://youtu.be/tPJQ0OQ6PLk?si=PVEZzPFbhddlZvDQ

Hi everyone, it's me Tim, and today I want to talk to you about hedonic adaptation. Yes, it's a big word. Um, I wanted to be precise, so I looked it up. It's also called the hedonic treadmill. It basically means you get used to things. That's just how people are. People seem to have a happiness set point. Some people are a little happier, some people are a little less happy, and it's just set for them. They don't know whether it's environmental or biological, they're not sure, but most people, even after they have big life changes, return to that set point. So you may win the lottery or get that job you always wanted or, you know, just win a car or something, and you're really happy for a short period of time, and then you just return to your normal self. Similarly, you may get a chronic health issue or a really close friend or loved one may pass away, and you'll be very unhappy, and eventually, you return to your set point. This is normal, happens to everybody. There are a few people that don't seem to have a set point, or throughout their life, maybe have a major change that causes a set point change, but in general, most people return to what's called their hedonic set point.

Now, you're probably wondering, like, why are you talking about this? Because hedonic adaptation is one of the many reasons that game development can be so hard. You can make a game with really cool new features and a cool new setting and a cool art style and a cool narrative tone, and people say they love it, and then they get used to it, and then doing it that way isn't enough anymore. And you start to see some of the features or the tone or whatever you did that was new and novel, you start to see it in other people's games, and eventually, you see it in a lot of games. And you're like, "Oh, now what? I can't do this thing that I thought was really cool because then I'll be repeating myself."

Just so you know, this is why, and I've mentioned this in other videos, why I really like making new games with new features you haven't seen before in new IP. I have tried to put a brand new feature that hasn't been seen before, at least in computer games, in every new game I've put out. I really like going to new IP because I like the new setting, I like the new system mechanic exploration. It's just maybe it's hedonic adaptation on my part, maybe it's my reaction to that adaptation in fans that, you know, they're always saying, "We want something new, we want something new."

But I can tell you, I've almost never made a sequel. When I've, I've mentioned this before, when I finished Fallout, I wanted to go work on something else, and I did start to work on something else, and because I was asked to come back and work on Fallout 2, I did for a while, but then I eventually left. You can go watch the video for that. It's sort of similar with Outer Worlds. I knew right at the beginning of making Outer Worlds that I was not going to be there after it was done. My husband had already moved, I was planning to move. I'm still working on it as a consultant, but I'm not in a lead role. I'm not even employed at Obsidian right now. So, I am working on Outer Worlds 2, but in a much more removed capacity, and that's just something that, you know, I tend to do. I want to work on something new. I start to lose interest unless there's some new way of spinning it.

In a way, hedonic adaptation explains why I'm semi-retired. I mean, I've got a lot of game ideas. I've got books and books of game ideas, but none of them are really knocking me out anymore the way I thought they would. I think part of it is, I've seen some of those ideas show up in other people's games, some of them in different combinations I've used in my own games, but also the effort to make a game that would have those features in it. This is a process I've been through many, many, many, many times, and it's kind of lost its allure. When someone says, "Oh, don't you want to make a game again?" It is exciting, but it also has been exciting for many, many, many years, and I kind of want something else. I don't feel like putting together another game of mostly features I've already done before. And like I've said, I will then have to argue with people, either above me or the people providing money, about those features, about whether they're good, whether they belong in this game, whether this setting is gonna appeal to the widest demographic. I mean, the questions you get now during the initial phases of game development are nothing like what you thought of 30 years ago. 30 years ago, you thought, "Is this going to be fun?" Now, one of the first questions I'm asking is, "Well, what's your demographic? What's your hook? Who's this going to appeal to?" And you're like, "Uh..."

So, that's something to think about. In fact, now that I have a lot more time on my hands, I've been playing a lot of games. I haven't mentioned most of them, I'm not going to, but most of the new games I play, I often think, "I've seen this before. I've seen this feature before. I've seen this art style before. I've seen this kind of NPC, these some NPCs that are just reused over and over again in RPGs to the point where I'm like, "I'm tired of seeing this." I'm tired of seeing the snarky companion sidekick. I'm tired of having the villain who has a twist, and maybe this isn't the real villain, or maybe this companion who was with you is really the villain, and I'm tired of saving the universe as a story hook. I'm tired of darkness rising. I'm tired of you've got to put this villain down. I'm even tired of the twists on that where maybe you get to be the villain. I mean, I loved Tyranny, I loved working on Tyranny, and I loved that it explored the a fantasy world that existed as if Sauron had won in Lord of the Rings. That was cool, but now I kind of want to do other things, and I don't know what those other things are, so I've been playing other games, and I told people, I've said on the channel, I'm not going to review games, but let me tell you, of all the games I've played in the last year, here's the nicest things I can say about them: "Wow, that game has a lot of features I seen before, but that's a new combination of them," or "Wow, this game has exquisitely good production values. That's some really nice art, those are some really nice cinematics," or "Wow, this game is returning to features that we explored 20 years ago, but there's a twist,

 or new technology is letting them do something different with it, or extra memory, either RAM or hard drive memory, is letting us have a bigger world or more reactive world." So, I'm seeing reactivity that I've seen before in older games but maybe on a bigger scale.

And it's kind of like, I've been playing games like, like okay, I mentioned, I'm looking forward to Starfield coming out. In preparation for that, I decided to go back and play all of Bethesda's games, all the way back to, I got Daggerfall, didn't finish it though, but I did, um, because I already owned them, I replayed and finished Morrowind, Oblivion, Skyrim, Fallout 3, and Fallout 4, because I wanted to play through them all again so when I'm playing Starfield, I'm like, "Okay, if there's something new and fresh in here, it's going to jump out at me." That's what I'm hoping for. When I see new games show up on Steam, on Xbox, I'm a big console player now, I'm waiting for like the new big thing, and yet I'm worried that hedonic adaptation is starting to ruin games for me. Between that and my history of being a lead and having to critique everything in the game I'm playing to make sure that the bugs are out, the designs working together, then things are balanced, between those two things, games are feeling a little less novel to me. And looking at reviews online, I'm wondering if everybody's experiencing that. I see a lot of people say things like, "I've seen this before," or "This reminds me of an old game," or "Isn't this just game X with this twist?" And I agree, for the most part, with what people are saying.

So, what do I want you to get out of this video? Hedonic adaptation is something that may be happening to you, and maybe it's why you're not liking some of the new video games as much. It's less than the video games and more about you. But yes, there are some video games that aren't really trying to do anything new. Hedonic adaptation is why I never wanted to make a sequel. Hedonic adaptation is why I'm semi-retired. And to game developers watching this, wow me. Come up with something really new, a novel, and just, and blow my mind. That's what I'm looking forward to. I want to retire and play some of the coolest video games that have ever been made. So, make them, please. And that's it.

History of Fallout  The GURPS Apps.md

https://youtu.be/efCn85Tvrf8?si=SPqtlTbrWn1mpdn9

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim. Today, I wanted to do a little bit of video game archaeology, or paleontology, I don't know, demon ontology, because I've been digging through my archives, which unfortunately only go back to 90, 91. So, I've lost most of what I did at my first, the first game company I worked at in Virginia, uh, Pegasus software, which turned into cyberon, where I made grand slam Bridge for Electronic Arts. I didn't take any notes on that, but before Fallout at Interplay and before the game I made before Fallout, rags to riches, and before I was even an employee at Interplay, I was a contractor in 91 making Bard's tale construction set. I was playing gurps a lot with my friends at UCI, where I was still enrolled. I was still enrolled in the PHD program, which I was quickly becoming less enamored with. I wanted to start playing gurps at Interplay, there were a lot of people there playing second edition AD&D, which I wasn't really that into, in fact, on all these books here, I think second edition is the only version of Dungeons and Dragons I don't own. So, I was, I wanted to teach them how to play gurps, which I was playing. Uh, I was playing with this, this is my original gurps third edition book, and I was playing this at UCI, and I was running a gurps space campaign, this is the old space book, and there's a chapter in here, chapter 10, which explains how to make star systems, and there's a lot of rolls, and a lot of conditions, and a lot of stuff that my Jello brain did not want to do, so I was like, let's automate this. So, I had made, nowadays we've cut an app, I made a small computer program, and it was all text, the ugly, and Scott Everts at Interplay offered to do some art for it, turned out to be such a cool looking little program that it's up on the net, you can still get it, the gurps star system generator, but I'm going to show you what it was like. So, you start it up, you pick what your tech level is, that little sphere is really a real 3D sphere, I was playing with mapping textures to spheres, so you, I select I don't know, level tech level eight, what it does is it then lets you pick what part of the Galaxy that you want to explore. I'll pick the spiral arm, and boom, it generates a random sector in the spiral arm. It's a little slow, there we go. So, you can click on any of the things here, if they're like, this is a what, a catastrophic variable, no system there, but if you pick a star, which is just a DOT, well, that's a loss of short skill planning good for it, if you pick a dot, it actually shows you the system, and you can click on anything, oh, this one doesn't have any planets, it's just a double star. So, what we can do is we can go back to the sector, and one thing I implemented was a filter, because it turns out it's really hard to find and some things, so here, let's look for life, boom, this system has life in it, so you go there, and it generates all the planets, you can see the one that's in the Life Zone, and there, there's all the information about the planet. Doing this by hand, pain. This made it trivial, and I actually used this in my campaign, my space campaign. So, that was fun to do, and it was actually implementation of the gurps roles, so this made me think, what else could I do, what else could I code, because I had played a lot of gurps. I would get into discussions, arguments, with friends who played about what the best attributes were to buy, and I was a firm believer that a dexterity was the best stat, far and above, better than intelligence, better than strength, better than health, the best thing you could buy. So, I ended up making a gurps combat simulator, and I can show it to you really fast, it's ugly, so we're not going to look at it, there it is, you enter their passive defense, and then it does a thousand rounds of combat between two different PCS, who, I believe, these stats had to be hard-coded in the game, uh, in the code, because I didn't feel like uh, entering data every time I ran it. Anyway, so I ran this combat simulator, and I even posted the results wreck games FRP gurps, uh, what I found, which was, yes, agility was the best, or dexterity was the best thing to have, in fact, what I found was, let me read it, so I had two people fight, both with broadswords, light leather, and a small shield, and each character was assumed to have put one point into the broadsword and shield skill, that's important, because though bro, they're both dex skills, so the dexterity guy is going to have a way better skill with one point than the other ones. I ignored advantages and disadvantages, but I coded everything else, so there was stunning rules, knocked down, unconsciousness, and death, all those worlds were followed. I also said that a 17-18 was always a miss. So, here's what I found, with setting all the stats to 10. and over a thousand combats, an 18 dex character beat an 18 strength character 83 of the time, 83 percent, an 18 dex character beat an 18 Health character 73 of the time, so Health seemed to be better than strength, so I did an 18 Health character versus an 18 strength character, meaning both of them have really bad broadsword and shield skills, and the health character beat the strength character 84 of the time. So, then I was like, okay, I'm gonna rerun it with uh, 18 dex and see what strength it would take before they were roughly 50 50. it took a 25, I'm sorry, the first thing I did with health, it took a 25 Health to balance an 18 dex, those two characters roughly beat each other half the time, and 18 Health was balanced by a 40 strength, that's what it took to make them a parody, but what shocked me was that 18 dex was never balanced by any strength, no matter how high, and this was because the Dex character hit the strength character so often, reducing their chance of hitting back, that even though those hits would have done a lot of damage, they never landed, either they're they rolled really low, or they would have hit, but then the 18 dex character just dodged, or parried, or blocked. Now, it's interesting, if you start adding advantages into this, like high pain threshold, or combat reflexes, yeah, then you could see that the deck, the strength character had a chance, but this is one of the things that made me go, hmm

, this is not what I expected. Later, if I ever talk about gurps being in Fallout, these were things we ran into making gurps Fallout, that there were things that were hard for us to balance for, because they were endemic to the system, same thing happened to me, years later, when I made Temple of Elemental Evil, when you make a computer version of a paper and pencil game, you really start to see where some of the Mini Max areas are, but that's not the last gurps app I made. So, we started playing gurps at Interplay, usually in the evenings, starting around seven or eight, people would run different campaigns, I ran a campaign, Chris Taylor ran a campaign, Scott Campbell made a campaign, so there were a lot of ones running, because character creation is a little complicated in gurps, and everybody was running using different books, I made a gurps character editor, so I automated character creation, and I made it so we could read in the advantages and disadvantages and skills from external text files, so if you're running a gurps space campaign, you could add space skills and space advantages, if you're running fantasy, you could pull in the advantages and disadvantages and skills from gurps fantasies and spells. So, it was really fun, and I want to show you, because I found it, I love that you can run old software from Windows, so here's my, here it is, it's ugly, I thought it was cute, it was hand styled, so there are your attributes, and you can raise them, and you can see down in the bottom right, it keeps track of their point total, and below, it's adjusting all the attributes of the pen on your base attributes, there are all the advantages, I think I did the basic set, so you could buy those, the points go in, you can buy disadvantages, though there's a whole bunch of those, we could that, that was, that gives you back points, you could also buy skills. One thing I was really proud of, in 1991, was keeping track of half points as one half, and not 0.5, so you can see, I buy short sword, and I'll buy it, there, yeah, I have a half a point in it, and you even see at the bottom, there's half points, I can increase it, keeps track of all that. And this was something that started getting used a lot, people were making characters to play, uh, GMS are using it to make NPCs for their campaigns, and in fact, Scott Campbell made a very similar automation for gurps vehicles, that let you make any kind of vehicle you wanted. So, gurps had gotten really popular at AirPlay, and that was the environment in 94, 1994, when it was announced that we were looking to pick up an RPG license, and that's why I was so gung-ho about getting gurps. I already had these three apps, between the combat one and the character editor one, I had a lot of gurps already coded, and they were all done as libraries, so I could drop them in, and we could get started right away on gurps Fallout, and that ended up what happened, but I wanted you to see kind of where Fallout came from, because I'm amazed that a, I have these executables, and B, they're running on Windows 10 in 2023. Thanks, Microsoft.

How Fallout was made SPECIAL.md

https://youtu.be/kgPwfHXiBjw?si=P0PUO7WX7QC_7CQY

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim. Today I want to talk about how in just two weeks, right near the end, about four or five months before Fallout shipped, we replaced GURPS with SPECIAL. Now, this isn't going to be a video about why we had to do that; that's another video, maybe, if I ever feel like talking about that. But what I want to talk about is how we managed to replace such an integral part of what you would think would be a game so quickly, and there's really two reasons for that that I'll get into, but they were that Chris Taylor, our lead designer, already had several Homebrew systems, and they had one that looked really good, and I'll tell you what that was and how we integrated it. And then the other reason we could replace the system mechanics so quickly was the nature of how Fallout came to be. And I know I've talked, and you may have read other places, that Fallout started very small, just me, and then I was really championing GURPS.

So let me talk about both of those. First, the engine. I made several different engines, just playing around, a lot of my own time. I made a voxel engine, you know, 3D pixels; they were really hot in the '90s. I made a 3D engine, and it was awful, and then John Price, a programmer, came on board and made a really awesome 3D engine for the Star Trek games. So, I went with the Sprite engine that I made. At the same time, I had started playing GURPS before I even came to Interplay. I played back in grad school, so by the time I started Interplay, it had been four years, and I had made, because I played GURPS Space a lot, I had made a tool called the GURP Star System Generator. You can probably still find it out there. It would generate a sector of the Galaxy according to rules in the GURPS Space rulebook, and you could click on the different stars in the UI, and it would tell you what the planets were, if you click on each planet would tell you information about that. 

And I had fun making that, so when I started introducing GURPS to fellow players, and I've told some of those stories in my other video about why I like flawed characters, we would play all kinds of different GURPS. That's what was the advantage of GURPS. We would play GURPS Fantasy and GURPS Space and GURPS Time Travel. We would, we had one campaign where I said they could use any of the books they wanted. I call that GURPS Everything, and that was a hilarious campaign. I have to talk about that at some point. Chris and Taylor and Scott Everts had two of the funniest characters. I also tried playing one where you weren't allowed to use anything, no magic, no psionics, and only the very most rudimentary skills and advantages and disadvantages from the basic set. We call that GURPS Nothing.

While I was doing all this, other groups started spinning up and playing their own sessions of GURPS, and they said, you know what, the character editor or the character creation is a little complex, especially when you had to tell people you can use these advantages but not these and these skills but not these. So what I did was, I made a GURPS character editor, and to help support all these different GURP sessions that were going on, it was completely modular, so the skills, the advantages, the disadvantages were all done in text modules that anyone could edit, and you could, when you started at the editor, you're like, I'm going to use these files for advantages and disadvantages and skills. And then I even made attributes into one because I'm like, well, everything else has a module; I'll just make attributes module and be done with it. People loved it. There were a whole bunch of campaigns going on. Scott Campbell, the original lead designer of Fallout, made a GURP vehicle editor. That's how in the GURPS we were. So that was probably around '92, '93.

So, Flash Forward three or four years, I've made Fallout. We made Fallout with the Sprite engine. GURPS was put into Fallout as modules, so in the middle of the combat system, it would say, this guy attacked this guy, what's his chance to hit, and would say, well, how far away are they, what item are they using, what are their skills, attributes, whatever, but that was all tucked away in library calls. So when the call came to like, hey, we may be replacing GURPS, how long would it take to do this? I met with Chris, and Chris Taylor said, I have a really cool system I want to talk to you about, give me two days. So I spent those two days looking at the code and how everything was isolated into the libraries, and I assisted that a little. I found a few things that weren't quite so isolated, and I tried to clean those up. I thought most of them, I probably didn't get all of them. Then a couple of days later, Chris came to my office, and he presented his system, and I remember the, it was attributes, traits, and skills. The attributes were strength, perception, endurance, charisma, intelligence, and agility, was everything but luck. It was SPECIA. Traits were a combination of advantages and disadvantages, and that solved a problem we were currently having where when you GMed a GURPS campaign, you would often tell players they weren't allowed to take certain disadvantages together, like if you were already blind, you couldn't take colorblindness. In the, in our Fallout version, we had to mark them as exclude mutually exclusive, sometimes if you had these two, then you couldn't take this one. What we ended up doing was just, you know, Chris's idea of putting advantages and disadvantages together in a trait got rid of any need for that. You just took no trade or one trade or two trades, and you were done. And the skills were a really good selection of skills that we could easily just redirect the, the calls from going to GURPS modules to going into this new game system skill module.

My suggestion at the time, though, is I said, I really, really want luck because, uh, I had some really good experiences with luck, especially in GURPS Supers, with buying ridiculous luck and phenomenal luck, and so we put that in. We did two things. We sent it up the chain, and we presented it to the team. The, I don't know if we got any feedback from anyone but Brian Fargo, but his suggestion, and all he said was, when you go up a level in this new system, I don't think it's enough just to buy skills. I want to be able to buy something else, and Chris Wynn, why, what if we put back in sort of sort of advantages? They were quite the same, but because there are no disadvantages, there was nothing we had to worry about balancing there, and also we're restricting it to you buy it every third level. Chris made a bunch of perk trees. They were really good.

 Brian loved it. When we presented the system to the team, they really liked it. Uh, they thought it solved some other problems we were having that I won't get into here, but some things we weren't sure how to solve that were coming up in testing.

However, after the meeting, one of the team members, Jason Swinn, came up to me, and he goes, you know, Tim, you presented it, and you called it a SLIPS, the first letter of all the attributes. I was looking at that, and I, I think you could rearrange them into a better word, SPECIAL. And I was like, oh, Jason, I don't know, you know, SPECIAL has some negative connotations, let me think about it. I don't have to tell you, by the next day, I was like, okay, SLIPS is out, SPECIAL's in, and the rest is history. And if there's two lessons to learn from this, it is that Chris Taylor did a whole bunch of heavy lifting, making a whole new system in days, based on its Homebrew system, and thank goodness for modular programming. It saved the day. So that's the story of Fallout's SPECIAL system. I still call it a SLIPS occasionally.

How To Be A Good Game Director, Part 2.md
Youtube Link:
https://youtu.be/sYZCYDRQtSs?si=3SU1PqUgYpYfTwsD

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim. Today, I want to do a part two about being a game director, and I'll put the part one link in the description. The reason I wanted to talk about this was not only after I did when I did the first one about being a game director, there's some stuff I forgot to mention because it's an awfully vague term enroll, but also, people ask questions that I wanted to get to an answer, but most of them are fairly short answers, so I thought okay, when I have enough of these, I'll do a part two and talk about being a game director part two.

One thing I mentioned uh in that video and other ones is that when I play games now, I am overly critical with them. I'll be playing a new game, it will install startup, and I'm like uh, why did why is this the cinematic you chose, this isn't teach me about your world. The UI will pop up, the first main menu, and I'm like uh this main menu is bad, why aren't these combined? Um, when I go to options, why don't I see this option immediately? It's bad, but you have to realize after four decades of being trained to think critically like this, it was hard for me to shake, and I felt bad about it. I think I complained about it in the previous videos, oh I wish I didn't do this.

And then, I was watching a documentary short about the making of Good Omens too. I should just say I love Good Omens, awesome that I read the book, loved it, really liked the TV show that was made specifically, uh the relationship between Aziraphale and Crowley was just awesome. Of course, I can watch anything with David Tennant and Martin Sheen. I watched Staged. I don't know if you've seen this, it's basically those two talking over Zoom, either just between themselves or with other people with tons of insults, and it is hilarious, but it's so obvious that those two actors are good friends, and it's obvious from watching Good Omens.

But what struck me during the short was Neil Gaiman, famous author, love his stuff, Coraline, the graveyard book, all great, great, great stuff. He was explaining his early work as a writer and he went to writing classes where he discovered that he was doing something fundamentally wrong, that he was reading other books as a member of the audience, as someone who was reading it to enjoy it and not critique it. And he learned that no, you should read a book as a fellow craftsman, which is very different. It's more critical, it's more judgmental in a way, but you have to admit you're not trying to enjoy this story, you are trying to learn from it, which means this is what they did good, and this is what they did bad.

And as a game director, you have to be the same way. You are not approaching this game as someone at home would and thinking okay, you know, are they enjoying this? You have to think way past that to is this good, is this the way it should be? You know, takes you into things like balance. The home user, or no player, well, may not care as much about balance as long as they're having fun, which is by the way how I like to be, but if it's too unbalanced, if the tone changes too wildly, if the if things are inconsistent, contradictory, you want to make those changes even though many people who are playing the game won't notice, and some who notice won't care, you still want to make those changes.

And as a game director, you are going to touch everything in the game: design, code, art, music, not just your specialty. This is something for the longest time, you know, I was like I'm not sure I should touch art, but then it occurred to me I can't play a single instrument, but I was the one who provided all the source material for the music in Fallout, because it really mattered to me. I cared about the music in Arcanum and and Temple. I like getting involved in the audio part of games, sound effects especially. I will often go back to the audio department where the sound effect sounds wrong, um, and I'd have reasons for that because I think that's really important. It's a it's a part of the game experience that often people think of last. It's like oh, I got this weapon, what does it look like, how does it fire, and all this, and you're forgetting the fact that you know, there's so much other stuff to this weapon that's part of the player experience, the sound of it reloading, the sound of it firing, the sound of a hit, the sound of a miss, the sound of a critical hit. So those are all things that you have to dive into.

Now, as I got older and my color blindness got worse, it was much harder for me to have art critiques that a) could be taken seriously, and b) I was 100% sure in the validity of because I was seeing far less of the artwork the way the artist intended, which is why I was super happy on our world that Leonard kind of took care of all that. But one thing I did do, and I didn't do it enough early, keep in mind, game director is only a name that appears, a role that appears next to my name in Outer Worlds, but I certainly acted that role in Fallout, in Arcanum, in Temple, because everything I just described to you are stuff I did in those games. I played it, I worked on it, I looked at it all critically, even areas outside my specialty, and I was the final word in a lot of these. Now, I shared that in Arcanum, uh, with Leonard and Jason, the same way I shared it in Outer Worlds with Leonard, but that didn't mean I didn't make comments to Leonard about art and narrative, for example, in the Outer World.

So, you will play this game, you will play the game if you're a game director more than anyone else on the team, with the possible exception of QA. And the reason sometimes you'll play more than them is QA approaches their work very differently. Someone in QA, their job is to find bugs and imbalances, but they frequently replay levels over and over and over, where often as a game director you're jumping to random spots and just play, and sometimes you're jumping at the beginning and see how far you can get because you want to see vertical slices are important, where you have a level that has all the features in it that the player may want to do. So this level supports combat and stealth and dialogue and crafting and getting companions and all the things you want to be able to do in the game, but you also have to think about what I call the horizontal slice, which is how is the game logic longitudinally from beginning to end, does it feel right, uh, is it pacing correct, those kind of things that you can only get from a long play, and there are people in QA do that, but a lot of people in QA are replaying the same areas every day, sometimes with different characters to see how that works. So I'm saying in addition to QA, no

 one is playing the game more than you, and you have to play the game a lot, and you have to be critical in a way that the home user won't because every player is different, but you have to make sure that you're trying to craft as good of an experience for all of them and not just people who play just like you. So I may not like playing a pacifist playthrough, but I want to make sure that those people have fun. I may not like playing someone who talks to everybody all the time, but you want to make sure that that player has fun.

So, that's something that's really important for a game director to do, even if that's not how they normally play. And let me get back to what I was talking about with playing the game from start to finish, it people have asked about this on the channel, and it's called maintaining tone. And this isn't just a balanced thing, it's tone is is like, remember that you as the game director wrote those design pillars, so even though you may not write every design document, you almost certainly won't write every design document, you'll write a lot of them, but you're not going to write all of them, the ones that don't aren't written by you should still comply with those design pillars, and when you play the game, you should never find anything that is, um, violating one of those design pillars. So it's important to play the game from start to finish with those design pillars in mind, from the very beginning when you create those design pillars, from the earliest designs, from the earliest meetings, including meetings with the publishers or whoever is going to be providing your funding, it there's a bunch of different ways of getting games funded now including doing it yourself, those in those meetings, you're the one who's representing the game as a whole.

So when people have questions about well is it always, is it are there gonna be jump scares in it everywhere, is it really depressing everywhere, um, where will the game get funny, where would the game gets serious, uh, where we'll have opportunities to dive more into the lore on this, where are there places where you might learn a mystery or two that's a complete side quest, how many of those mysteries will get solved by the end of the game, these are things as a game director you should just be able to know an answer because no one should know the game more than you. Now, particular narrative designers, particular artists, particular programmers will know a lot more deeply about their specialty, but no one should have a broader overview than you, and this is all throughout the game, including the very very end, um, you're the one who's probably checking every level, checking every item, every character to make sure that not only supports does design pillars but that the tone and feel is right.

Balance is an issue here. I didn't do it enough early on in my games, which is why, like when I talked about Fallout, I mentioned maybe first aid and doctors should be combined, maybe there weren't enough uses for energy guns at the beginning of the game. These are things that as a game director I should have stayed more on top of, these that's the kind of feedback you'd expect from a game director. This often means at the end of a game, when you literally have thousands of bugs and issues, there are some issues that aren't classified as bugs, they're more like this doesn't feel right, or we could do a better job here, but it's not a bug, those are all in Jira or whatever your bug database is, you're the one who ultimately responsible for prioritizing those. You're a publisher, whoever project funding will certainly have things that they're telling you this has to be fixed before you ship, but there's a lot of other things that you decide on the priority of, and that won't often be in agreement with everybody on the team.

But nothing ever is, if you tried to put a committee together on that, you're never going to get the committee to be 100% in agreement on any of these things, so yes, you listen to your leads, but ultimately, you're the one who's prioritizing a lot of these issues. That's why every game ships with some bugs, with some other issues because if you cannot get to all of them, and in big complex games, you almost certainly won't, the game director is the one who's prioritizing all that. Don't always do a good job, certainly we've shipped with things people I can't believe they ship with that, but you know if you explain yeah, I know that's really in balance, but we were looking for a crash bug, certainly the crash bug probably has priority over an imbalance of a particular play type in a particular set of levels. Never a good answer, but since you usually don't have enough time to do everything you ever want, and maybe you shouldn't because look at my videos on Arcanum, that we put everything in the kitchen sink in there, and I don't think that was necessarily a good idea.

How To Be A Good Game Director.md

https://youtu.be/F7uaMQnMsvI?si=I69p5x1sTcuMnxTs

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim. Today, I want to talk about what it's like to be a game director. Now, this is what it's called now. It used to be called the project leader, sometimes in the 90s, producer meant the person who was really running the show or was the lead designer, but they've really consolidated a lot of these roles now, and game directors what's usually used as the person who creative director sometimes is the person who's running the project. It's kind of like the showrunner on a TV show. Basically, this is the person who has the vision for the game being made. That doesn't mean people on the team don't share that vision, but if you think of it as a boat, there's one person at the wheel who's steering, and he's usually either the captain or he's taking his the choices he's making are coming from the captain. I don't think you'd want to be on a boat where anybody could run up at any time to the wheel and turn it. You're either going to hit an iceberg or run aground on a sandbar or something bad is going to happen. You probably won't get to your destination.

But this means that directors have to make all the really tough decisions, and not all of these decisions are objective. There are subjective decisions that have to be made, and because of that, you sometimes just have to say, "I'm declaring this is what we're doing." It's a Fiat. Um, I heard um, I think Josh Sawyer once called it the benevolent dictator, and you have to do this because sometimes there are people that just will not let an idea go. For example, Outer Worlds, we had, I was co-director with Leonard, and that is one of the rare situations where I think you can have multiple directors, and that's because we divided up the work. We both worked on setting and story, and then I went off and did system mechanics, and Leonard did art, a narrative. This worked for us because we totally trusted each other in what the other one was doing, and we let them have the final say in the autonomy in that.

Now we had an open door policy at Obsidian. This meant we had lots of people come in and argue our decisions, and I will admit a few times we changed our mind, okay, that's a good idea, we should do that. But there were a lot of hours lost to people who simply would not let it go, that their decision was subjective. Let's say mine was subjective, and I win. I'm the director. I win. Lost hours and hours and hours to people talking about that. Now, I thought those were productive hours because if you can get someone convinced you're right, the feature you're talking about will probably end up being better. If they're making it, they're all in. If they're not making it, they're not going to the person making going, "Isn't this dumb? Don't you wish it was done another way? Isn't this the stupidest feature you've ever seen?" which has happened on many, many games I've worked on.

Another Director, but because London and I were co-directors, an interesting vantage point I'd never had before where I got to watch a another director get I can only call it mansplained. That's the best thing, even though the artist doing it was a woman. They did not agree. She did not agree about our art style. She wanted to be more like Fallout one. She proceeded to explain the art style of Fallout one to Leonard. Now Leonard and I shared an office, so I was working. I had eventually stopped working and just watched Leonard. I listened to her but watched Leonard as she explained why that art style was better than the one we were using and we should be using it. Now, there were a lot of reasons we did the art style we did on the Outer Worlds. She wasn't having any of it. Now, I'm the last person in the world who's ever going to explain art styles to anybody. Forget my color blindness. I'm aesthetic blind. It's probably why I'm good at playing gray box levels, but I don't think I've ever tossed my controller aside or walked away from my keyboard because I thought a game looked bad. I just, I basically will play anything if I think it's fun to play.

**Responsibility**

So, it was interesting, this discussion, because I didn't feel like I really had any any skin in that game, but it was so odd watching someone explain the art style to someone who created that art style. And in the end, you know, Leonard had to say what I had to say to some designers, which is, "I hear what you're saying. I understand it. We're not doing it. We're just not doing it." And that's something you have to do because as the Director, you're going to end up taking responsibility for almost everything in the game after it ships, whether you decided it or not, whether you even liked it or not, because once the game goes out, unless it's like a a bug that needs to be fixed or something that's imbalanced, you can't really just go and say, "Yeah, I wish I'd done something else there. Sorry." Now, you will correct it in the sequel, um, and of course, this applies to things that you were involved in. For example, and I think I've said this somewhere, I was in an interview, and they asked if Outer Worlds is before our world to chip, if they asked, it was going to be on Steam, and I said, "Sure, it's gonna be in Steam."

**Weeks Later**

Private Division and Epic made a decision all by themselves that no, it wasn't going to be on Steam. It was going to be an Epic exclusive for a year. Money changed hands, decisions were made. Leonard and I were not involved in this. I don't even think Obsidian was involved in this. People got really angry, and there were a lot of comments, "Tim lied. Tim lied in that interview." I didn't lie. I said something which later on turned out not to be true that I had nothing to do with, and that made me mad. I remember, uh, telling the communications guy at the time, you know what, I'm just going to pass on PR for a while. If you were a private Vision wants me to do something, my answer is no. I'm just not going to do it for a while because I was mad, but that's pretty much all you can do. Um, Eric DeMille calls it me taking my football and going home. I've only done that twice, like in a big way when I walked away from Fallout 2 and when I walked away from WildStar, which I guess it's somewhere I'm gonna have to do a whole video about carbide. Carbine was one of the best places and worst places I've ever worked, simultaneously smashed into one company. It's a wild story. It's also very long, um.

**Bigger Goal**

So anyway, what I'm saying is when you're a exam director, you have to take responsibility for a lot of things that you ultimately had the decision for, so you had the responsibility for, even if you don

't necessarily think that's the way I would have done it. You have a bigger goal in mind as a director, you know, you, you want the ship to get to its destination, to go back to that analogy. Maybe you would have gone left around that sandbar instead of right, but your Navigator convinced you that they had the right idea. Sometimes they're not Navigators right, sometimes the Navigator is wrong, but if you run against The Sandbar, people are going to blame the captain. That's just how it works. Frustratingly, in the last few years that I was at Obsidian and was involved in hiring people, I saw more and more people apply directly to be a lead or a director with no experience, and it it kind of was like, where are they getting this like incredible ego from? Because if they have talent to match that ego, this person is going to be a Powerhouse. I rarely saw that combination, but I finally asked somebody who had no experience, he was fresh out of school, why do you think you can be a tech director? He said, "Well, look at all the projects I was Tech director on," and I would like, "You've never been a tech director." He goes, "Oh, yeah," and he started pointing at school projects, and I was like, these are school projects. You, this has no bearing on being a tech director on a professional project. He was always exactly the same, and I'm like, did you hire these people? Could you fire them? Did you adjust their salaries? Were you how is this in any way like being a real Tech director? Um, did you have to deal with, you know, press or um, marketing, or did you have to make decisions that were um, completely outside of your purview because the decisions weren't being made and deadlines were up? It was a strange conversation, and I finally got him to say that his Professor had told him to do that, and I said, you have that Professor call me because what you're doing is tantamount to fraud. Saying you've had Tech director experience when all you've done is run a school project is fraud, and if any of your professors, if you're a student, Professor tells you to do that, tell them to stop because if it's somewhere I work, I'm gonna put the kibosh on that, and I haven't talked to some of my tech director friends at other companies and said, has this been happening? A few of them like, yeah, nothing happening. So we talk about it, and we all agree, stop doing it.

**Moral**

So, what's the moral of this story? When you're a game director, you will quickly learn that there are not always objective decisions you have to make. Sometimes they're subjective ones, and this gave me new insight when after being a game director on projects, when I went back to being a team member like I did on South Park and Pillars of Eternity and Tyranny, I had a rule because I didn't want the people to think, oh, Tim's always, I'm just going to take over the project. No, I didn't want to. My rule was if the game director ever made a decision I didn't agree with, I talked to them privately about it one time, and I would say, "I really think this isn't the right decision," and I tried to frame it objectively, but sometimes I'd have to just say, "I just don't agree with this. I think it will lead to these things." Sometimes I would get the director to change their mind, but there were several times they said, "No," and I said, "Okay, I'm not going to bring this up again." I broke that rule one time about something I felt so strongly about that I went to the game director a second time and went, "I know I said I'd only come once, but I'm going to talk about this one more time because I see what I said happening, happening." And they agreed what's happening. They just didn't think it was a big deal, which is what I mean about objectivity versus subjectivity. And I see this in reviews. I see this when people talk about games they don't like. You're confusing your taste with objective reality, even when you think you're not. I've seen people go, "Well, this game crashed too much. It objectively sucks." Well, how much is too much? What about this other person who just goes, "Oh, I just saved the game a lot. It doesn't affect me." Are you, are they wrong? Are you wrong? Basically, they found a way to enjoy a game that you could not. The game is good to them, and it is bad to you. That is subjective. There are a few objective things that can go bad. If there's a game where, like in my personal thing, if there's a game that you can make a build, a character build in an RPG that literally can't finish the game, that's bad. If this used to be big problem in RPGs in the 80s and 90s, if you could destroy a quest item completely accidentally, that's bad. It's bad even if it's a good game. Ultima underworld looking at you when I accidentally clicked to give someone a quest item, and I didn't click on them. I clicked next to them, which it interpreted his throw, and I threw a quest item in lava, and it burned up. The game was now no longer completable, and I had to go back to a save game for about an hour and a half before. My bad for not making frequent saves, they're bad for putting in a mechanic like that, but whether that bad mechanic led to a bad game is completely subjective, which is why when I talked about yesterday why I didn't do reviews, that's why. I find reviewers I like, and I use their judgment on past games to decide if they're they align with me, and then I use that to decide whether I want to buy a game, and that's why I find it strange when people hate a game so much they feel like it's their duty to go around and say, "This game is horrible. Everyone needs to stop buying it's my duty to the world." Well, the problem is nobody really knows who you are, and unless you really have a a defined way of doing your reviews and all the basis of your reviews that people can look at, they don't know if your opinion matters to them. Maybe you hate a game because it doesn't have a lot of color in it, and I'm not going to care about that, and that's also why it's important as a director for my other moral is you have to have some people below you that you utterly trust to fill in the gaps and where you know you're bad. I know I'm not a good narrative writer, especially for dialogues. Find good ones. I know I'm not that good at balancing. Find someone who's good at that. So, as a director, you have final say, you have final authority, but you always don't make the final decision because you sometimes have to rely on someone else who you think knows better than you, but you do take the final responsibility for that. So, I think any of you

 want to get into game development and want to eventually be a game director have to understand this. You will make most of the decisions, but you will take all of the responsibility, and the final decision is yours, even if your final decision is, "I'm gonna go with what that guy's saying because I know I'm bad." It's an interesting Balancing Act. It does get tiring, which is why for a while, I didn't want to be a director anymore. I just wanted to, I just wanted to go back to what I liked, which is doing code and a little design on the side. It is fun to eventually be a director. It's not for everybody, but I hope if you want to get into game development, start lower down and watch, find the good directors and watch them, and I think you will find that the way they steer the boat is if you end up at a good destination, a lot of it was how that boat was steered.

How To Build A Motivated Team (1996).md

https://youtu.be/shH7tTIUNWc?si=KVwynxk5HmTPcTjH

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim. Today, I'm going to read to you a presentation that I made I think it was sometime in 1996 at Interplay on how to build a motivated team. I mentioned this in a previous video. I didn't have the presentation for years. I just had the notes I used to write it, but a few years ago an ex-co-worker from Interplay approached me and he had a printed copy of my talk. So, I have the actual thing that I presented, and I will I wrote a preface to it because this is written 27 years ago. I think I was 30 years old. It was my first and last time being a producer, so I thought this needed a little introduction. So, I'll read you the instruction and then I'll do the presentation. So, here we go.

So sometime in late '96, Brian Fargo asked me to address the other producers in our regular producer meeting. He liked how I was running my Fallout project and he said he was equally impressed with the high morale of the team. He asked me to talk about how I managed to do that when many of the other producers were complaining to him of low team morale and low work ethic. Bear in mind when reading this, I don't consider myself to be a particularly good producer then or now, but the bar was low for good production at Interplay. Not because the producers weren't trying, but because we had absolutely no training. In fact, when I asked the executive producer there for training, he said that's not how they did things. They just threw people in the pool to see who could swim. Well, I didn't think being held up as an example of a great producer was a good idea for me, but it was something I didn't understand at the time, and the document below will show them my understanding of the role was superficial at best. This document is not an example of good production guidelines. It's a time capsule that shows what great production was considered to be at Interplay in the mid-90s. We've come a long way since then. Anyway, back then I wasn't sure exactly why my team was doing so well, so I decided to ask them. I got a lot of feedback from them, and this is the document I wrote.

It's called "How to Build a Motivated Team" by Timothy Cain, GURPS Project Leader. By the way, we lost GURPS about two or three months after I wrote this. This report aims to provide producers with a set of instructions for building a large, motivated in-house team and getting them to produce high-quality software. Like any new endeavor, you should start by making some personal decisions, such as asking yourself what kind of project you want. Then you can select a group of people and organize them into a team that is willing and able to make that game. And finally, you can keep that team running smoothly with a few basic management techniques. You'll find yourself rewarded with a great game.

**One: Start with Yourself**

Before embarking on any new project, you should decide what genre you want to work in. Do you want to make a role-playing game, or an arcade shooter, or a strategy game? Make sure you understand that genre and have played a lot of games that our industry has produced. Your new game will have to compete with every other game on the market. Don't limit yourself to just researching PC games. Look at the Mac market, stand-up arcade games, and even pencil and paper games if it's appropriate. You never know what may trigger the next great idea.

Next, pick a project that you like. Few things are more demoralizing to a team than to work on a project whose producer doesn't care about it. This means you should complain loudly if you're assigned to a project you don't like. Don't assume you're grown to like it. Most projects, even the most desirable, become tedious at the very end, and if you don't like the project at its conception, you never will.

Don't take on too many projects at once. In an ideal world, each producer would only have one product at a time. Since most of you need to produce multiple titles at the same time, try to concentrate your creative energies on just one of them. Perhaps the others will suffer and become B-grade titles, but you cannot devote yourself to more than one A-grade title at a time. More importantly, your team won't operate very well with your divided attention. You can only be part of one team. If you find yourself with several potentially stellar projects, complain to Alan. That was Alan, the executive producer. You should assign the extra projects to other producers, for your sake and for the products.

Finally, create a clear design specification for your game. This specification could be a written document, or it could be a storyboard, or even a prototype engine. Not only will it help you anticipate your resource needs, but a specification also shows others that you're planning the game you're planning to make and may help attract resources to your project. If you don't feel up to making the design specification yourself, get a competent designer and have them make one for you.

**Two: Get the People**

Once you pick the project, it's time to pick the people. Or better yet, let the people pick you. Teams seem to work better at Interplay if their members asked to be part of the project rather than they were assigned to it. This factor is so important that it might be wise to wait a few months for someone to finish their current project rather than just take whoever is available at the time. You can use that waiting time to finish your design specification anyway.

When looking to fill a specific job, don't necessarily take the first person you find who's best suited for that particular job. Instead, look for well-rounded people who can do more than this specific task at hand. These people will serve you better when later in the project unforeseen tasks arise. This means you should look for people who aren't afraid to try new things. When Leonard Barski joined the GURPS team as lead artist, he wanted to try using clay heads in our encounter window, despite having never worked with clay before. The technique would require us to invent the process of loading the heads, scanning them into 3D models, adding different facial features such as hair and eyes, and animating the final images. But the results were the coolest looking head since Max Headroom first aired, all because Leonard wanted to try something new.

Another important trait to look for in potential team members is the Catalyst. The book "Peopleware" by Lister and DeMarco describes Catalyst employees as those employees who make teams gel or work smoothly and efficiently together. A catalyst isn't necessarily the best worker at his own job, but catalysts can make the other people in the team better at their jobs. They do this by understanding the other members' jobs and coordinating their efforts. Often the producer is the catalyst, but this doesn't have to be so. Jason Taylor was a catalyst on the GURPS project because he programmed and also used art utilities. He understood how 3D art was translated into the game's art specifications and how the game's animation code worked. He would often suggest changes to the art or to the code that would make the animation look smoother or use less memory. He would also organize the art specified by the designer so the most important

 work was done earlier than the fluff art, and that similar art was done at the same time to promote a consistency of look and feel throughout the game. Typically, Jason would save us man-months of time by spending an afternoon thinking about the code and art together rather than in separate parts of the game.

Of all your concerns while trying to put together your team, the most important is to make sure you get enough people to meet the project needs and no more than that. If you get too few people, they'll be overworked and frustrated. But if you get too many, which is highly unlikely at Interplay, the project will be a coordination nightmare, and some people will be left with too little to do. Ultimately, Alan will approve your choices, and if he won't approve enough people you need, then reduce the scope of your project. In other words, if Alan won't give you one egg, don't make an omelet.

Where do you get your people? Projects are finishing at Interplay all the time, and you only need one or two people to get started. While programmers can be difficult to obtain, talk to Jay Patel for suggestions on in-house programmers or for new ones to hire. If you go to talk to the master or the other art directors with your design specifications (which you did make one, right?) and explicit list of art you need, you'll be much more likely to get artists you need. After you get started with just a few people, others may ask to join later. Remember, people ask to be on your project are coming to you pre-motivated. Take advantage of this.

**Three: Set Up The Team**

Now that you have your people, you need to arrange them into a coherent team. Most projects at Interplay are set up as a hierarchy with the producer at the top, and the three leads (programmer, designer, and artist) coordinated work in their areas and answering to the producer. While this setup is traditional, team GURPS has tried a different approach. Team GURPS has no producer, really. I code most of the GURPS-related programming: the hex-based isometric engine, the combat routines, the character skills, and advantages, while overseeing the work of other programmers who handle scripting, interface, and code optimization. Leonard's art sets the tone for the look of the game, and he manages the work of three other artists. Between the two of us and the designers, we work out the details of the storyline, the characters, and the dialogue. Fred Hatch, the team's line producer, handles a lot of internal coordination such as checking dialogue and storyline for consistency, for processing art for inclusion in the game. He and I together handle the interaction of the project with Interplay and the world: for regular project reports, schedules, and contracts. Of course, anyone can make suggestions and point out problems in the game's design. In fact, everyone on the team should be encouraged to take part in multiple roles during the project's creation. Programmers and artists should feel free to add their ideas to the design of the game, and designers should feel free to suggest art styles or try to push the coding to the technological edge. Of course, the final decision lies with the lead of that area, but implementing the suggestions of a team member is highly motivating. People love to see their ideas come alive.

Physical proximity of the team is also important. The team offices should be near each other, and offices should be shared by those people working on the same part of the game. Grouping designers with designers and artists with artists will encourage ideas to be shared and make sure designs stay consistent.

**Four: Run the Team**

By this time, you should have a design specification and a group of people willing and able to implement it. Now what? First, establish a regular weekly meeting. At the beginning of this project, this meeting will serve as a brainstorming session for other game ideas and will get everyone comfortable with working with each other. Later, it will be a forum for discussing problems and issues about the game in an environment where everybody can contribute.

Second, make sure that people you give people uninterrupted work time. People need a time to just do their own work. Unless it's very important, don't call or drop in on someone for part of the day. Make it a habit to visit after lunch or first thing in the morning, or some other particular time. Make sure you are available throughout the day to handle any problems that might arise. Yes, this is a double standard, but you just gonna have to accept the fact that someone has to be available around the clock to coordinate the project.

Third, set up deadlines. People seem to work better when they're working towards a milestone, but don't make phony deadlines just to make busy work or pressure your employees. Make sure the person knows why the work needs to be done on that date. For example, the dialogue needs to be done on Wednesday so we can start voice casting, or that explosion needs to be finished next week so we can test combat. Those are good explanations that get people going.

Finally, challenge your people. The well-known Hawthorne effect, that people perform better when trying something new, can be used to your advantage. Encourage new and novel features, especially if the people suggesting them can implement those features themselves. Again, people like to see their own ideas incorporated into the game. They feel like they own part of the game, which of course they do. And once they've established this ownership, they strive to make the whole game great because nobody wants to be associated with a terrible game.

**Now, there are some things to look out for.**

There are pitfalls to working on a big team. Some people like working in large groups because their work becomes anonymous; no one person is responsible for a given feature, so those people hide in your team and do very little work or very low-quality work. You need to watch out for these people because they will destroy your team's morale. Also, remember that peer pressure can be good and bad. It's good when it drives team members to higher quality. It's bad when it makes people feel like outcasts inside the group. And maintaining a good environment is your responsibility as producer, and this environment is more than good chairs and fast computers. Try to make friendly and constructive comments and keep the team cohesive.

Finally, keep an eye on your attitude. It is possible to work hard and enjoy yourself at the same time. Love your game, like your people, and have a good time. We're making games together, and that's supposed to be fun.

And there you have it. I wrote that in 1996. I gave it to all the producers during an off-site meeting, and it was pretty well received, but I was right back to work the next day. So, I hope you liked it, that little time capsule of production at Interplay in the mid-90s.

**Intro**  
Hi everyone, it's me Tim. Today I want to answer another question, a good one from octopus RPG, who asks, "I'm curious if there are any games that you didn't work on with mechanics or design that made you think 'wow, I wish I had thought of that.'" Yes, there are so many that what I did is I went back and tried to look at my top six or seven, and it goes back quite a ways because I keep a lot of notes as people know. In fact, I'm going to show you some, because throughout my career, I've encountered games that just made me go, "That's neat, I like that." Some of them had mechanics I never ended up using, some were ones that I'm like, "Hey, I'm going to make a modification of that." So let me start at the beginning, going all the way back to the 80s.

**My Top 7**  
The first time I played *Ultima 3*, I had a ton of fun with that game. I think it's my favorite Ultima; it's also the first one I played. I'm frequently like that, like I like *Baldur's Gate* one more than two, probably just cuz I played one first. But *Ultima 3*, I played before one and two, so I just kind of like *Ultima 3* the best. One of the things that was in there was there was a moon gate, and it was called a moon gate, and when you stepped into the moon gate, it seemed to teleport you at random to different outside different cities throughout the world. It probably took me longer to figure this out than other people, remember this is back before you could go look stuff up on the Internet. The moon Gates were actually controlled by the phases of the moon, moons, there were two moons, and at the top of the interface, there were two little circles, and they would change phase as you play the game, and they're right next to the time, so I assume they were there just to give an indication of passage of time. No, depending on the phases of those two moons, they controlled where those Moon Gates went. Took me a long time to figure it out. When I did, I was like, what a great idea because you could then, by just glancing up at those phases, know exactly where the moon gate was going to take you.

There was something else actually in *Ultima 3* that I noticed I kind of liked, it didn't like it as much as the moon gates, which was wind. The game would always tell you the direction that wind was blowing, and I wasn't sure why that was needed. They ended up using it for when you were running around in boats, the wind would control the direction your boat could go, you could never take your boat directly into the wind. Didn't use boats that much, used it occasionally, there were a few places you needed a boat to get to, but I thought that was kind of cool.

The next game I remember thinking, whoa, I've said how much I love *Star Control 2*, and that I do considered to be an RPG, just happens to be that you're the ship and all the upgrades apply to you, the ship. But it has everything else RPGs have, it has a big open world to explore, it has dialogue, it has inventory, it has levels, it has quests, it's a cool game. If you haven't played it, I think it holds up. But one thing that I thought was really interesting about *Star Control 2* were hit points in that game were crew members. When there was, I don't remember if it was for every ship, but there were a lot of ships where when you took damage and the bar went down, that was your crew getting killed, it was your crew being killed. There was one ship that powered its weapon, its powerful weapon, with hit points, which meant it was shoveling crew members into some kind of furnace to burn to shoot this weapon, kind of blew my early 20-something brain.

The next game I remember going, "Wow, I love that idea," was the first time I played *Diablo*, and I played a few levels, got to the butcher, which apparently everybody gets to, I think it's like level five or 10, and my butcher level was different than other people's butcher levels. In fact, we talked about how we fought the Butcher, and we all realized some of the rooms were the same, but the rest of the dungeon was different. The dungeons were being procedurally generated. I thought that was super cool. I love procedural generation. I think AI is going to be a great tool for games, not just for conversation, but I think some procedural generation of details in a world, AI can do a great job with that. What's funny is the original D&D guy, DM's guide for AD&D, had dungeon generation in the back. And as you all know, I keep notes, this is a book I have, it's just graph paper, and I generated dungeons at random when I was in high school, and I still have them. It's funny stuff, but these were all things that I made, um, just cuz I thought procedural generation was a neat idea, and I ran my high school D&D group through a few of them, and they didn't know it was procedurally generated, they it just seemed like a typical dungeon to them, so plus plus.

The next time I remember going, "Wow," ironically, was for *EverQuest*, not *WoW*. *EverQuest* was a really great MMO, in many ways better than *EverQuest*, but *EverQuest*, when I first played it, and I realized, after all my years of playing LP mud, that *EverQuest* was literally like LP mud with a graphics front end wrapped around it, I was like, boom, this is transformative. This, I know I think *Ultima Online* came out before, a little before, about the same time, but *EverQuest* is the one that made me go, this is going to change the way people play games online, and especially online RPGs. *EverQuest* just was, they did so many things right, even if it wasn't as polished as MMOs that would come afterwards, and in many ways, I don't really care about the polish, I care about the ideas, and *EverQuest* was jam-packed with some really good ideas, and some frustrating ones, but to me, *EverQuest* was a game that made me go, take note, it's the late 90s, things are never going to be the same again.

And then the couple other games I want to talk about that when I played them I went, "I like that," um, the first one was *Fallout 3*, when I noticed that weapons and armor could degrade, but you could repair them with similar weapons and armor. What I loved about that idea, instead of just saying you have to go find generic screws and, you know, metal, it you used your repair skill, so the amount repaired was proportional to your repair skill. But because some of those weapons were really common, it meant some guns were easier to keep repaired. It meant some guns were easier to keep repaired because you were always seeing these as drops so you could use them to keep your weapon in top condition. Some things were really hard to find. Radiation Suits, um, I think like radiation suits were they in Fallout 3 or were they only in Fallout New Vegas, but I remember they were very rare. So repairing them by finding a similar radiation suit, those were hard to find. So what I would often do is if I found a new radiation suit, I'd wear it until they were both worn down a little bit, then I'd combine them and make them better again. I like it because it made rare items either harder or more expensive, depending on how you wanted to look at it. Harder to find them or the fact that you were using them to repair rather than selling them, and I love that because the decision was entirely on the player. And I also loved how it made sense. I'm going to repair this thing, oh, I've got this other thing I can scavenge for parts, so I love that idea.

The other thing I saw once came from Bethesda's other Fallout game, Fallout 4. I liked how they handled radiation. In our games, radiation was kind of like poisoning. It had an invisible meter because we didn't want to do another UI element. It would tell you when you got radiated, it would tell you when things started to affect you, so you knew something was happening, and then you could take radiation drugs before, after, after to try to ameliorate it. What I loved about Fallout 4 was when you got near radiation, you heard it and saw it because it would pop up saying, you know, radiation plus 3, plus 4, but the radiation meter was your health meter. As your radiation, as you took radiation damage, it reduced your max XP.

Now, I love this idea for multiple reasons. One, from a UI standpoint, it's brilliant. You have one meter that represents two different stats. From a system mechanic standpoint, I love it too because when you start taking radiation, it is automatically pushing down your maximum XP or maximum HP, so you know you're losing hit points but your bar is still full because it's filling with radiation at the top end. So you see radiation increasing and your max Health going down, even if you use a Dr, like rataway to get rid of that radiation, and it goes away, the high part of the bar, I think it's red, um, color blind, I don't know, it goes away, you're still left with lower Health. You then have to heal your health with stimpacks or going to a doctor or sleeping in a bed. I love that idea because it makes radiation have side effects that you have to deal with that make sense. You're already you already know the radiation has lowered your health, it's still lowered when you heal the radiation because radiation is healed separately than health. I love it. It is, it's in my mind, it was kind of like the perfect mechanic because both in the way it worked systemically in the game, the way it presented itself through the UI to the player, and the way the player then had to react to it and deal with it, we're all just great. It is something I like to point to, um, to uh, junior designers and go, that's an example of a perfectly implemented design feature. I don't know what their design pillars were, but it would hit all of mine about easy to understand, requires the player to handle, make sense on how to handle it, so I like all that stuff.

So I think how many is that, one, two, three, four, five, six, okay, that's six different games I've mentioned: Ultima 3, Star Control 2, Diablo, EverQuest, Fallout 3, and Fallout 4, all of which had mechanics or a general design that made me go, "wow, I wish I had thought of that," and that was a great question, Octopus RPG.

How To Make A Good Game Setting.md

https://youtu.be/kW7gOPHmr-Q?si=pQdyeOnYDZ8-N5dX

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim. Today, I want to talk about how to make a good setting for computer games. I'm not going to talk about the structure of the design document. I want to talk about how you actually develop a good setting, and this was actually really hard for me to do. I started and stopped writing down things about this video several times because I wasn't sure how I did this in the past. I don't want to say I stumbled into a good setting; there was obviously a process I went through, but it wasn't necessarily conscious.

I likened it to when you ride a bike or when you're learning to knead bread. You know when you've reached a point where you can stop kneading it, but it's really hard to describe. I've seen people talk about pinching it and stretching it. It's like, for me, it's like you're kneading it, and then it feels a certain way, and you're like, I can stop. Kind of like making a setting for a game. I work on it, and it gets a certain way, and I'm like, okay, that's a good setting.

I thought about it this way. I've restructured this discussion into here's a series of questions you should ask yourself about the setting you're making, and you should have good answers to these questions. And these questions should not be hard to answer. If they are, or the answers aren't quite that good, rethink. And this is important. I've talked about this with people when I work with them: people get an ego attachment to things, in a sense that they create something, and they think it's perfect and wonderful, and you're questioning it is somehow an attack on them. If you get into that mindset, you will not be able to be a good designer. I'll just say that. If you think everything that comes out of your head is brilliant and requires no critique from anybody, you're wrong.

And you're going to see that as I walk through these questions, they're kind of like poking at the setting you just made. So let's start with the very first question I have about any setting, and that is: Is it easy to explain to someone in a way that they grasp the setting, they understand what you're trying to do, they can imagine it? That's why in the video I talked about how you write documents. The very first one was setting, and I said different people will read these. That setting document is usually read by everybody, including the publisher. They may not dive into your mechanics, but they're going to read that setting document, and they're probably going to have questions. So you have to make it something that when people read it, they immediately go, "Oh, I get this." And that's why elevator pitches exist, where an elevator pitch is a very short description of what you're trying to do. I mean, the elevator pitch for Outer Worlds was Fallout meets Firefly. That wasn't even from me; that came from one of the founders of Obsidian, and we ran with it. But it's great because it's short, and it makes you go, okay, I think I imagine I know what that would be.

If you can't describe your setting very briefly in a way that makes people go, "Okay, I think I get that," your setting may be too complicated. It may be too niche. But we'll talk about your target audience later.

So then, the very second question I ask, after I'm like, okay, I get your setting, I get it, is: Can you tell an interesting story in this? Now bear in mind, and this is something we go over with every narrative designer we ever work with, um, and when I say we, it's because I always think that with Leonard or Jason or the people that have made stories with, the story in a video game is not linear. It doesn't have to be. In mine, they aren't. And non-linear means you can set up the chapters that you want them to go through, but the method they go through them is entirely on their own. Uh, we talked about how players never do what you think, but sometimes those chapters can be in different order. They may go, you know, go to one location before another, and you're just thinking, okay, I'm gonna have the story handle them doing this part before this part, and then I'll rewrite dialogues to handle this part for this part.

But at the very high level, are you even telling a story that's interesting? If the setting is, you can make a setting that's easy to understand, but there's really no interesting stories in it. The setting itself is interesting, but does it, can you think of narrative, can you think of how the player would go through it, that that makes it sound like that's what they'd want to do? Um, part of that for me, and this is personal, is, is the setting reactive? So as the player does things in it, people change, situations change, so now some events are possible and some aren't, as their, the player's own personal story, personal playthrough of a game story unfolds. That's important too, because that's something that only a video game can do. A book can't do that. If I read a book and you read a book, it's the same book. We may bring our own perspectives to it, we may have drawn different conclusions about why certain things happened or why characters did what they did, but you and I read the same book. When two people play one of my games, they often have very different playthroughs, and I love that.

And because of their different playthroughs, they think differently of different NPCs, of different events in the storyline, especially if those events are major and have major effects in the world, that then come back to the player. So you want to ask yourself, is your setting open enough to have that kind of reactivity? Very specific to video games. And related to, but not quite about the story, is, can you come up with interesting quests to do in your world? Excuse me. It's been raining a lot here. If you make a world that has lots of fun things to do, that should correspond to quests that you and your quest designers can come up with that are interesting for the player to do. If you can't come up with those interesting quests, if everything in your world is "go talk to Bob, then go talk to Mary, then take this widget to Susan," if that's all of your quests, I don't think you have a very interesting setting. You certainly don't have an interesting story. There should be things like you have to go resolve this situation, which may involve talking to a lot of people, finding evidence, maybe you kill a few people, whatever, whatever way you go through that. But that should be an interesting quest.

Have a, to me, of an interesting question, figuring out how I want to solve it. When I'm led through a quest, it's like, "Oh, go talk to this person, then take this widget to this person, and then kill this person, and then go back and tell everybody you're done." That kind of bores me. So if your world supports a lot of different kinds of

 quests with their own solutions and reactivity, you're probably on to a good setting. Related to that, do you have interesting characters in your world? Do you have a literally interesting NPCs, whether they appear in cinematics or you can interact with them? They should be really interesting. I've seen games that, and some of them are good, where there's no other NPCs in the world. These are often puzzle games.

But I see people make RPGs that there really aren't anybody else to interact with. Because of that, you lose a lot of depth in your game because NPCs are there to help advance the story, to show reactivity, and also just to be really interesting, and they help refine what the setting is because they're telling you things. In Outer Worlds, we had the companions chatter all the time to you, and because you could have two of them, they'd often chat back and forth with each other. And that was a great way of doing world building because they would say things you might not even think to ask, or you may not be noticing, but they notice it, they chat about it, you hear that, and you go, "Oh, that's interesting." It's reinforcing the setting through the NPCs.

My next question about your setting, it's hard to be specific about it, it's hard to be concrete, but is your setting evocative, meaning, if you describe your setting to someone, okay, we've already established they can imagine that world, there's an interesting story, there's some quests, it's got reactivity, but do I actually want to play in it? This is different for different players, but in general, people want to play in a world that somehow draws them in, lets them invent a character, a persona, to play in that world in a way that's interesting to them. Evocative settings are hard to create, mainly because you don't want to lead the player through the nose and say, "Look at all these, look at this one, look at this one." They want to find these things, but you have to make it so that they want to go find those things. The world has to be a little mysterious, unknown, maybe a little scary, all these are things that draw people in and go, "I want to know." Fallout, people often go, "What do you think the draw of Fallout is?" And they used to say, "Well, it's a big world with no laws, so players can do whatever they want." But there's also that interesting, you search through it, like, what would the world be like after a nuclear war? No weird animals, radiated humans, going through the ruins. It's just, there's something evocative about doing that, about wandering through the remains of our civilization.

The next question only matters if you care about sales, or demographics, or the reach of your game, or if any of those things are imposed upon you by the people who gave you the money in the first place. But that is, how mainstream is your idea? Fallout, Arcanum, we never asked that question. I've heard people say they're cult classics. I know they were niche. We didn't design them for the audience. We never really thought, "What are people going to think of this? Who's going to care about this? Who's going to want to play a game?" We were just making a game for each other. The Outer World was not made that way. One of the things I was told at the very beginning was, "We want casual players, casual RPG players to want to play this." This changes things. It changes what you put in the game. A lot of people spend that as, "Oh, you dumbed everything down." No, you can have things are just as complex, whether it's the story, or the setting, or the mechanics. You just have to kind of lower the slope.

I tried to explain this once, says, "The view from a mountaintop is just as gorgeous whether you climbed up, rock climbed up that mountain, or drove up in a car." Yes, there are some people who say, "Well, I'd appreciate it more if I rock climbed to the top." Okay, I appreciate it more that I can drive up and enjoy the view without risk of death. So if you ask yourself that question at the beginning, you might design your setting, or your story, or your mechanics slightly differently so that it is easier to get a broader market interested in what you're doing. Once you've got them, you can start introducing much more complex stuff, but it kind of means you front load things that are more mainstream. I've talked about the book, I love Lord of Light. Part of the reason I love it is it starts like it's a fantasy novel, and you're like, "Okay, I'm gonna read a fantasy novel." Then it turns into sci-fi. I love that. I love that about the book. And some of the stuff it investigates about the meaning of identity is really interesting. But it doesn't front load that, and I think that's important if you know who your game is for.

Finally, one of the things I want to talk about, because it's come up in the questions, is I want to talk about the evolution of these things. I told you, like Fallout, Arcanum, when we did not think about the setting, how it appeal to people. We liked it, so we did it. But when I talk about when you write this down, when I talk about these documents, I saw some comments, people know, documents are so 20 years ago, we don't do that anymore. You do. Don't take me literally and say, "This is a Word document, or a printed document." It's not what I meant. When I first started, we had no documents at all. People just tell you what they wanted, and you'd code, and if you had any questions, you go back to that person's office and go, "What did you want?" Later, by the time I did Rag's to Riches, I mentioned that I would get design documents on napkins because I'd be at lunch with Tom, the producer, and he'd write it on a napkin, and I'd go back to my office and go, "Okay, this is what I have to do."

By the time we got to Fallout, yeah, we were writing things down, but it was loose. There wasn't a main design document. I can't hold up a Fallout design document because I don't think there was one. Arcanum was different. We had to go to a publisher. We had a very big thick design document. But we did it in Word. We gave them printed copies, but we did it in Word. I mean, a tracking turned on because later, we changed things, and I'm going to go into a whole video later about the massive changes Arcanum went through before it shipped, not all good.

But that evolved over time. So finally, by the time I did Outer World, the design document for that was a hierarchical, interlinked set of Confluence pages. So you would go, and it would be like, "Here's introduction to Outer Worlds," and then you dive down, "Here are the system mechanics, here's combat,

 here's melee, here's two-handed melee," with hierarchy like that. But within that would be links to all kinds of things. I'd be saying like, "Melee, as opposed to ranged, here's a link to range, uses these rules, um, here are the formulas these rules we use," and it goes off to another page. "Here are the items that this, here are the skills like you use in melee, and here are the items that use those skills." Link, link.

What's great about that is, though Confluence pages automatically track changes, so you can look back at earlier versions, but because they're living documents that anybody can look at any time, if you have a meeting with a programmer and say, "This is what I want melee, you added mailing skill to be like," you can then send them the page, and he can read all about two-handed melee. He can read about the context of it as an inside of combat. He can read details about two-edited melee, the items that are going to be marked as two-handed melee weapons, and it just informs their code.

I would highly recommend that even your setting documents be done like this. If you don't have access to Confluence, do it in Word, but keep tracking changes turned on. They will change as you ask these questions, and you get answers, and you're open to get that. Like I said at the very beginning, don't be too attached to anything you make. You will make changes, and you want to track those for two reasons. One, it's interesting to go back and look and see what a change, what changed. But frequently, people go, "Wait a minute, why don't we do this?" And you're like, "Oh, well, we used to do that." And if you look, you can see the comments that people made and the reasons we changed it to this new way, especially as people come on projects late. They may also, they may go, "Well, how come your setting doesn't include aliens? Or why doesn't your setting include hyper-intelligent AI?" It's like, "Well, we made this conscious decision in the setting document. You can go read about it."

So, I think that's most of the ideas that I have on process. Like I said, I mean, I started doing this back even before D&D. I made board games as a kid. The process of making a setting is hard for me to describe, but I think these questions will guide you into making a good setting. So, I hope that helps.

How To Write Design Docs.md
Youtube Link:
https://youtu.be/ohHLUKj3NTk?si=Ku4BAy5pKhAd2ONk

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim. I've told a lot of stories about game development, but today I actually want to talk about process, specifically how I make my design documents. I want to talk both about the order I do them and what actually each one contains. So most of this applies to the original IP that I've made, but it can work for other games. I mean, I've made D&D and Vampire, but this is the process I go through when I'm creating an IP from scratch, and I want to write documents because I know once we get a team attached, people are going to want to know answers to a lot of things.

### Setting

So when I do my documentation for a new game, I always do them in a very particular order. I always start with setting, and then I do story, and then I do system. So they all begin with S's, but the reason I do it that way is setting kind of defines the space in which the game will be. The story is a very high-level description of what every player will experience going through it. It's sort of the main they will help to find the main story quests even if there are multiple solutions to go through going through those quests, and then finally I make the system mechanics because it's important to do that last so that you have mechanics that support things you've said in the first two documents. If you have system mechanics that are completely unconnected to your setting or your story, you probably haven't made good system mechanics.

So let's go into each one of these documents because they're not only very different documents but they're intended for different people and they're written differently.

So for the first one, the setting, this is something that will often be one of the first things that a publisher, whoever's going to give you money, will see. So I try to make that setting describable in a sentence or two. It's often called the elevator pitch. You want to be evocative. You want people to be interested in the setting. You want to come up with a setting that is easy to put stories in and easy to make quests for.

One of the reasons I always thought the games that Troika made were so evocative were they were all placed in settings where there was a lot of player agency. There's a lot of things players could do, and that basically means you can't have a setting that's too authoritarian, that has too much law. You can do it, but you want to make sure that there's some kind of room for the player to move around in.

Most of the settings I've ever made could be described as here's a thing that's very easy to explain, oh but there's a twist. I think that that helps people understand what you're making, and the twist makes them go, "Oh, and this is why it's original." And then the twist can be used and explored to see what would happen if with this difference, what how would the setting be different than other settings have come before.

So I'm going to use some examples. So for Fallout, when we finally arrived on a post-apocalyptic setting, we wanted it to be different, and Leonard's idea of making it 50s inspired was itself inspirational because the 50s predicted a lot of things about you know if a nuclear war happened, if the Cold War exploded into a hot war, they predicted radiation everywhere, mutations, monsters, gangs of people, robots going crazy, and these were all things we put in Fallout just that alone without even talking about the story you already have an idea oh yeah I think I know what this game will be like.

We did the same thing for Arcanum. When Leonard and Jason and I sat down, we were just saying what do we want to make, and we had made Fallout because we didn't want to make a fantasy game, so now that we felt like well we we deserve our own shot to make a fantasy game, we didn't want it to be standard, and the idea was what if a very standard fantasy world, very Lord of the Rings, very you know you got your elves and your dwarves and magic, what if an industrial revolution happened because every fantasy game seems mired in the 14th century like they have wagons and water wheels, maybe very very primitive guns, and then everything stops right there as if all that stuff would be invented and then invention stopped. So he said what if tech kept going and kept going and magic and tech started conflicting. So that's how we came up with that setting, and then settings like that sort of lead you into what the story could be.

Let me make sure I made notes on this because I'm like I want to make sure I cover everything. You want to make sure that your story makes sense within the setting you just defined. Yes, the setting is very evocative, but you want the story to be something that people actually want to do. It lets players explore the setting you want, and you want them to be able to create whatever player character they want, and that's important for me. A lot of games don't do that, but for me, if you're really an RPG, don't assign me a character, don't assign me a role, don't even if you name the character for me, you're probably gonna already have lost me. I want to make somebody who's my conception, and then I'm gonna play my character in your world, and your job is to react to it.

So examples for that were again we're to look at Fallout, Arcanum, and Fallout. What was great is we had this vault which had been sealed, so neither the Vault dwellers nor you, the player, knew what was outside. You just knew it was some radioactive hellscape. The nice thing about what we how we set it up where there was an emergency, the water chip was a complete McGuffin of course, we just needed to get a reason to get you out of the Vault.

The fact that you could make any character you wanted was supported by the story element that the Vault dweller to leave was picked by lot at random. Nobody wanted to go out. People who had gone up before had never returned, so you knew it was dangerous, but by selecting them at random, that let the player make any kind of character they wanted. In fact, if you make a dumb character, you might go, "Why in the world did the Vault send out this idiot?" Well, you were selected at random. They probably went, "Okay, we're giving this guy two weeks, and then we're gonna do another lottery." That probably what was happening, but somehow you were successful.

But I love that. I loved that the player could make any character he wanted, and going out to look for the water chip and then he gets involved in something much bigger which is the survival of the Vault itself beyond getting water.

We did a very similar thing in Arcanum. Our fiction was that you were a character taking an airship to a new continent looking for work. There was remembered that there was all this work to be had in the in this great new city, Tarant. And then the airship is shot down by orcs flying biplanes. It's just it was it was crazy. You're like, "I don't know what this is," and you suddenly get caught up in something bigger,

 and we actually made fun of the trope where you were the chosen one because Virgil thinks you're the chosen one, but you think he's crazy. But I again we did that. You made any character you wanted. You have a reason to be involved in something really big, but it's not at all what you expected, and again Arcanum was completely open world. We let you go in any direction you wanted to explore this setting any way you wanted. No matter what direction you went in, we had quests and storylines we wanted you to experience.

So that gives me brings me to the third thing which are systems. The systems are really important that the systems you make support your setting both in tone and in actual mechanics reinforcing what you've just told the player the setting is like. So in Fallout, it was really important to have combat skills because the way sound is dangerous, stealth skills, dialogue skills. You basically did not know what you were going to encounter, so we gave you all these tools in your player character toolbox to deal with it, and then on top of that, we put in things like radiation because of course, you're getting generation. We throw in lots of drugs because that was just something that this setting would have, all these drugs to deal with things like healing and radiation and dealing with poison and just all the things that were going to happen to you in the wasteland.

Arcanum was a very similar thing. Yes, we put in spells, and we put in tech schematics for you to learn because this was a, that was what the setting included, but we also put in the meter that had your magic in tech because we wanted magic versus tech to be reflected right there on your character sheet. Yes, there was a greater cultural war going on between these two factions, but the war was also going on in your very character sheet every time you decided to take a spell that meter went think towards magic, and then you learned a schematic oop over there towards tech, and you had to think about that every time you bought something. You had to think, "Do I want to move my meter?" This was something that involves the player in a very direct way to the setting you just made.

Now something that I think is very important to put in your system design docs which is something that you probably didn't need in your setting or story were every mechanic you put in should have a goal or set of goals listed at the top of the page. These can range from really high level goals to very specific goals, and I'm not talking about goals like let the player have fun because that should that should just be a given. I'm talking about why is this particular mechanic being included in the game. You need to justify it. This time I'm going to use Fallout or, okay, I'm going to use Outer Worlds as an example. So we had melee and ranged as completely separate skills, and one of our high-level goals was melee and range combat should feel different and offer substantially different play experiences, but neither one should be significantly more powerful than the other.

To some of you, that may go, "Well, duh," but that was something that I wanted to state because I wanted to make sure that anything that got designed by other designers into the in the game supported that high-level goal, which meant when we did the page on melee combat, there was a goal specifically for melee that wasn't for ranges. It said melee combat needs to be simple and easily accessible for casual players but have higher skill maneuvers for advanced players.

So then when we were doing our melee combat, we made the conscious choice that melee when you swung a melee weapon, if the target you swung at wasn't was in range of that melee weapon and in the arc you were facing, it always hit. We did not roll to hit. If I swing a baseball bat at you and you're in front of me, I hit you with that baseball bat. The skill determined how much damage you did, and this was very different than ranged. When I shot a gun, the skill determined whether or not I hit it all, but then when I hit, it did damage within the range of the weapon. So that right away made melee range feel different.

Then we added additional melee techniques. We added like power attack and sweep attack, so if you were playing so casual players could just pick up a baseball van you know boom boom I'm hitting the thing in front of me boom boom. Advanced players were like, "Oh, this would be a good time to do a sweep attack because there's three monsters in front of me," or "My baseball bat isn't doing much damage against this robot's armor. I'm gonna do a power attack and try to override the armor's defense." The fact that we'd written these goals explicitly into all the design system mechanic pages from the top to the bottom meant that when we discussed these system mechanics, we could separate our discussions into does this mechanic achieve the goal we set out to do versus I don't think that's a good goal.

I found many people when they start to when they disagree with something, whether it's another designer, someone else on the development team, people play your game later, or even reviewers, they often don't separate these things. They don't go, "Well, this game did a good job of doing this, but I wish they hadn't done this." We needed to do that because when you're developing a game, if your fellow developers don't agree with your goals, that is a very different discussion than whether your individual design elements achieve those goals, and you should have that discussion first and get everybody to either agree that these are good goals or at the very minimum agree that these are the goals you're going to try to achieve. If you don't have that, and I've worked on a few teams that don't have that, things will go bad for you. People will be making different games on the same team.

I feel like I got very lucky with Fallout and Arcanum that we were all making the same game. Later on at Carbine and Obsidian, I often saw people not working on the same game goals, and by the way, this goal idea, this wasn't mine. I got this from Josh Sawyer when I worked with him on Pillars. That was something he was doing, and I was like, "This is brilliant." It's sort of like I've always done this implicitly, but Josh explicitly wrote those goals down at the top of the pages, and I thought that was brilliant. I'm like, "I'm stealing that. That's good. You guys should steal it too." Josh is a very good system mechanic designer.

So the other reason to do this explicit goals so you can have these discussions and you can know that you're talking about do you not like this particular mechanic or do you not like the goal of this mechanic is if you go into design something you have to realize is that everybody on your team in management who will play your game and will review your game thinks that they're a game designer. They're not, but they think they are, and that means as a game designer, you will get feedback that programmers and artists don't ever get. No one ever walks up to a programmer and says, "Yeah, I was playing the game, and it's pretty obvious you're using quick sort. You really should be using insertion sort. Go back in there and change that." No one ever

 goes up to an artist and said, "Hey, I was playing your game, and some of the animations looked a little stiff, so I redid all the animations. Here they are. You should put them in your channels."

No one does that. Now of course, don't get me wrong. I've been a programmer. I know what kind of stuff they deal with. They come up like, "Your bugs, your game is, your code is buggy. Fix it." Also, I know are the people come up to artists and say the most unconstructive things like, "I don't like that." That's really constructive, which as a side note, if you give feedback that isn't constructive, your feedback is worthless. I know that sounds harsh, but it is. If you give unconstructed feedback, you might as well not be saying anything. If you just look at something of that stupid or I don't like that, that's worthless feedback. Nobody can do anything with that feedback. They're not going to start throwing darts against the wall until you say, "Oh, okay, I like that." You have to say something more, and that's why at least for design because it's almost all written before the game is made, having these goals in place in your system mechanics design let you have much more constructive discussions than just people going, "Yeah, I don't like that melee weapons always hit." Okay, that's how we're making the distinction between melee and range. How would you make that distinction? That is a very different response to give them than okay thanks for that comment have a nice day.

### Summary

So that in a nutshell is how I do my design processes: setting, story, system. In the system, goals on every page. I think if you do things in that order and you follow those guidelines, I think you will have a much more productive system design experience. Thank you.

Humor In Video Games.md

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim. Today, I want to talk about humor in video games, but before I do, I want to point out this is my last shirt. You've seen every shirt I own, including shirts that were boxed up in the garage for a decade or two or four. This is it. I'm gonna start repeating shirts after this. A thing didn't think it would be a thing, but it was a thing. That thing is over.

Okay, let's talk about humor and games. I think it's pretty obvious if you've played a lot of my games that I try to put humor in all of them. Some of them are obviously humorous. I mean, Outer Worlds wore humor on its sleeve. Fallout was always described as a darkly humorous post-apocalyptic game, but if you look hard, you see my humor in all my games. For example, in Temple, which was pretty straightforward, pretty, you know, by the books, the indie game, the humor comes up in a lot of the characters I wrote. I wrote Farrella, who was the older sister who hadn't been married off yet in the village of Hamlet despite her dowry. If you marry her, wow, does she have things to say about you, about places you take her to. She hates everything and everywhere and everyone.

But I also slotted it into Vampire, and I told you, I only worked on it for the last year, so I had nothing to do with like Deb of the Night and some of the radio stuff, which was hilarious. My stuff occurred in the bosses that I did. So, if you played the shark-headed boss in the frozen fish warehouse, which was an instance because I decided he was going to throw fish at you, which meant all those fish in all those shelves had to be physics objects. And let's just say that the Source engine at the time, running on computers at the time, was very unhappy when you said, "I want a hundred physics objects right in the same location." In fact, starting that level, sometimes you can hear a little noise as all those physics objects come to a rest on the shelves. And of course, you know, the shark boss would pick them up and throw them at you.

But I also did it with the Man-Bat, the final boss, the what the sheriff turned into. When he would dive down to pick up objects, I originally just put a bunch of objects down there for him to pick up, but eventually, I made a list of things, and there were things like cars and signs and trucks, uh, but then I eventually like started having them throw people at you, and it was funny to make them iconic people, so he threw police officers and I think prostitutes. Um, they would so they would still be alive too when he threw them, um because they would take damage when they hit you and frequently they would die. I believe there was one time I think I would automatically kill them because otherwise I think there was a point where the police officer would get tossed into you, take damage, shrug it off and stand up, and start shooting the Man-Bat, which I thought was funny, but I think we took that out. I think I made it when they hit you, they died.

So, what I want to say about humor, other than I like to use it a lot, humor and games is hard to do. A lot of people think it's easy; they're wrong. Most games don't try it, and most games shouldn't. Not every game needs to be funny. Um, it is just a hard technique to put into a game, especially to put into a game in a way that is good for that game's theme. That's why the humor in Fallout is very different than the humor in Outer World, it's very different than the humor in Temple, very different than the humor in Vampire because those are different games. In that sense, humor is also dangerous to put in because there's a lot of different humor you can try, and some of it, a lot of it, is wrong for your game. But a lot of it is also stuff that will set off some people who are playing your game. I mean, you don't want to offend anybody, although there were some people who will be offended by almost anything.

Humor is dangerous in that respect. Humor is also dangerous in the sense that what's funny to some people isn't funny to others, and they will get upset that they're not getting the joke or you're being not funny or it. I tried to follow the same rule about humor that way back in Fallout, I imposed on making mentions of cultural references, and specifically, if it's put in there and the people don't get it, they shouldn't even notice it was there. So that way, they don't feel excluded, and that's really good with humor because humor is a really easy way for people to feel excluded. They know a joke is being told, and they don't get it.

I know I mentioned in Fallout that one of the perks you could buy was the Slayer, and it was if you got your unarmed really high, you could buy this perk that there was a chance when you punch someone, you just had a chance of killing them outright. That makes sense, the name Slayer makes sense for that perk, but for people who watch Buffy the Vampire Hunter, they knew we were making a reference, and they're like, "Oh, this Slayer." Similarly, when we put in the limited edition Red Rider BB gun or the Red Rider BB gun at all, people knew we were making, well, we're making a reference to the movie A Christmas Story. If you didn't get that reference, if you didn't get that cultural reference, it was just a BB gun called Red Rider, okay, that makes whatever. But either Bob, the guy who sold it to you, or he didn't sell it to you, you found it in his trailer. I think either any of this dialogue or in the description of the limited edition Red Rider BB gun, it says something like, "Be careful, or you'll shoot your eye out, kid." To someone who's seen A Christmas Story, that's funny, but if you haven't seen A Christmas Story, it just sounds like good advice, be careful because this, the whole point of the limited edition is it does extra damage, and it's easier to hit people in the eye. That's what it does. If you've never seen the movie, it's still a good weapon, and that's still good advice. If you've seen the movie, it's funny. That's the humor I like, doesn't exclude anybody, but if you get it, it's funny on a different level that's not important to experience.

But that's not the only reason to put in humor is to occasionally have a haha time. I've always said that pacing in games is really important in the sense that it should be fast-paced at some times, slow-paced in others. Humor is the same way; it should be funny at some points and then dark and serious in others. And that's because, like everything in life, you want ups and downs, you don't want monotony, you don't want flatness, and humor helps games have that up and down. There was something I used to say at Carbine a lot when people were like

, "Well, we're having a lot of fun putting in bosses, we should do all bosses," and they'd even point to Shadows of the Colossus, and I'm like, "But Shadows of Colossus has a lot of downtime between bosses where you get on your horse and you ride through a countryside for a long time, looking at the landscape, maybe fighting a couple, I guess trash mobs is what they would be called now." So I used to say, "People would rather ride a roller coaster that goes up and down than a monorail. Doesn't matter how high the monorail is, it's still a monorail." Humor is like that. Humor provides that pacing.

Humor is really good as a relief valve. This was really important in a game like Fallout because you would see some horrific stuff. I mean, we put in death animations that were horrific, people's limbs being blown off, blood, bones exposed. Adding humor to that game lets you laugh after too much pent-up tension occurred, and as Leonard used to like to remind me, humor makes the dark parts even darker. And I think that's something that's good to remember, that you can't have darkness without any light. You can't have light areas without dark areas; you need that contrast whether you're making storyline dialogue, item descriptions, found lore. Having some humor in a game helps provide release to the player, make the dark parts of the game seem darker in contrast, and also makes a game fun. And I'm a big proponent of making a game fun. Like I said, I propose making a game fun before making it balanced. It's important to me.

The best way I can tell you of distinguishing humor is that the biggest difference I saw between the original Fallout game and the original Wasteland game was the humor. I think there was more humor; there was some humor in Wasteland, I think there was more in Fallout. That delta is a big part of the difference between those games, and I think that if you enjoyed both of those games, which I think you should, that's a good way of looking at it and going, "That's one difference along many axes of difference that we did with Fallout that was hard to put in." Dumb dialogue helped a great deal; it's a big part of what makes Arcanum funny is the dumb dialogue, but I don't think you should build an entire game around dumb dialogue, and I've never built an entire game just around humor, but I think it's really important. I just want to do a video on it to remind people it's hard, kind of dangerous, and a lot of people won't get it, so make sure you add humor in a way that doesn't feel exclusionary to your audience.

And I think that's everything I have to say. Sorry, this wasn't a funny video. Uh, it's funny talking about humor isn't humorous. I think I saw a comedian say that once; it's why comedy schools aren't funny, and people who go to comedy schools tend not to end up as good comedians. But anyway, I hope you enjoyed that.

Implementing Endgame Slide.md

https://youtu.be/zjtctCu6VoI?si=cHvgctbHsCYR2axn

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim, and today I want to talk to you about implementing endgame slides. I know I've talked about slides before, and in a way, this is going to be a companion video to the one I did last month on how to do the beginning of video games. But end slides is something that I've done in a lot of my games, starting with Fallout. My games are kind of known for having choice and consequence, called CNC, which, just a side note, CNC used to refer to the game Command and Conquer, and for a brief period in the 90s, the CNC Music Factory, that song "I Got the Power," very popular in that Simpsons episode where Homer thinks Bart's gay. Anyway, it was a really funny period of time where people started talking about the CNC in my games, and I had no idea what they were talking about because CNC was already a well-used acronym.

Anyway, so choice and consequence basically means, in my games, you usually have many choices you can make, and a lot of those have consequences that happen during the game. Some happen right away, some happen during the game, but a few of them have very long-term consequences. And one of the things that we wanted to do ever since back in Fallout was replayability of our games. We've put so much choice in the game that there's no way you can experience all the content in one playthrough. You just can't. I mean, if you kill someone, you're not going to talk to them. If you rescue Tandy, she's not going to get killed by the Raiders. So, it's just real choice and consequence usually means you have to replay the game.

Because of that, I wanted the game to show what the long-term consequences of your choices were, and that led to us putting in slides. And the slides worked out really well in Fallout, and we had such a good time doing it for Arcanum. We tried to make even more. We did it also on Temple, to some extent on vampire, and then we brought it back for Outer Worlds.

I want to talk to you about how we implemented them and how some things were easier than we thought and other things were suffer. Basically, these slides are implemented by using a set of tracking variables. As the game is played, we record decisions the player makes. Now, some of those tracking variables are specific for slides, but you would be surprised how many variables already exist to do other things, so you don't really need to make new variables just to use for slides.

For example, while the player is playing the game, they're doing quests, and some of them they're completing, and that gets stored. Some of them they fail, that gets stored. There also frequently narrative designers store variables to remember what path the player took in the dialogue, or variables are used to record what achievements that the player got while they were playing the game.

So, in addition, the end slides, in addition to looking at particular variables that are stored for the purpose of the end slides to look at, they can also look at what quest you finished or what quest you failed, what achievements you got, some of the things you may have said in dialogue, whether or not certain NPCs are dead, what the reaction state to the player is, and also what factions have certain reactions to you. So, you can look up like, does this faction love the player or vilify the player? Those kinds of things. I mean, you'd be surprised when you go and look at the game state data what's saved away in a save game, how many end slides you could make just based on that data alone.

So, what we always did is we made a bunch of end slides based on that entire set of data, the specific tracking data, but then all the other things as well. And it turned out quickly that these end slides were extraordinarily dependent on the narrative designers. So, you really have to get them on board with wanting to do this because they're the ones that are ultimately going to know all the big decisions and choice points that the player's going to make throughout the story. And any of them that can't be tracked via quest or achievement or any of the other variables are going to need specific slide variables or basically global variables that are used only by the slideshow at the end.

And the reason these slides are going to be super dependent on your narrative designers are, you're going to have to have them be responsible for tracking all those important events. They're going to have to be responsible for making sure that they have slides for all those events, and that may seem simple, but a lot of those slides, you're going to have to be very careful about overlapping or interdependent events. For example, you may have a slide if you kill person A and person B becomes the ruler, you want a slide for that. But if you kill and if you kill person B and person A becomes the ruler, you want a slide for that. But what if you don't kill either of them? Who becomes the ruler then? What if you kill both of them? Who becomes the ruler then? Just right there, you have four potential slides you're going to have to make. Maybe there's a co-ruling side where A and B rule together or get married or whatever. And then if you kill both of them, maybe it causes an uproar in the kingdom. So, you need slides for all this, and you need to make sure that your narrative designers are tracking these things.

One thing that happened in several of my games where, and people discovered this when they went to mod them later, is the logic wasn't correct in the slides, and either a slide showed up when it shouldn't have or the slide just didn't show up. And I talked about this when I said designers did a lot of QA of the game at the end because they were the ones who had to look to see if the game was doing what people wanted. QA can only tell you if the game seems to do something strange or buggy. They can tell you that it seems to be an error. They can't always catch, "Hey, the game did this, but the design said it should do this." The designers are the best ones to catch that.

Similarly, if you see a slide appear and you didn't do anything to make it happen, you can report that and go, "I don't understand why this slide came up about you know A and B ruling together because I killed both A and B." But if a slide doesn't appear that was supposed to, if you're not the narrative designer in charge of that, you had no idea that slide was supposed to appear. So there's no bug to enter. It wasn't, "Hey, I killed A and B, and it didn't say anything about it." It was, "You did a lot of things. It doesn't say about you. Don't know that's a bug."

So, a big problem we've run into on end slides is the narrative designers really have to own and track that system. Now, there is some dependency on end slides on art because, you know, their pieces start, and somebody has to make them. But since they're usually unanimated slides, sometimes done in 2D, but sometimes you can just use screenshots from the game. You could take a picture of a town and a screenshot of a town

 and say, "This town thrived." You could take a picture of that town when it's being attacked by bandits or when it's burning or on fire or something and saying, "This town didn't survive." And it's perfectly fine, and players are more interested in what the narrator is saying than particularly what's on the slide, as long as the slide supports it.

So, we found that the slides themselves weren't that big of a generation cost. It was bigger for the narrative people. Now, because of all these dependencies, despite me wanting a lot of end slides, my games have literally varied on how many end slides they've had, how many conditions we caught, how many different slides we end up showing. Now, believe me when I tell you, the goal is always to have as many as possible. CU, it's very disappointing when you did something that you thought was important, and then the game doesn't recognize it at the end. The whole point of CNC is to have the game recognize at some point all the major decisions you made.

Turns out, by necessity, slides kind of have to come last. You have to have all those quests in place, you have to have those NPCs in place, and they have to be debugged. Because if you spend time making end slides and then take out a quest or remove an entire area, which means you may lose some NPCs, then you've made a lot of stuff for nothing. So, because of that, end slides tend to be made at the very end of game development. Well, the other two big things that happen at the end of game development are bug fixing and optimization, and those things always take priority over the end slides. So, while it's true that your narrative designers and your artists tend to have the most free time towards the end, it's the programmers and the QA that are super busy right at the end of a game. Sometimes you just can't spare the resources to implement the end slides.

So, my games have always had a varying amount of end slides, and trust me when I say I always wanted more, but I'm usually happy with what I got. If you are planning to make end slides yourself, what I would do is, as you're making the game, every single choice point, ask yourself, is this something that's going to show a consequence right away or at some point later in the game? And if yes, great. If not, ask yourself, is this something that's going to have a long-term effect that's pretty major? And if so, write down what the different slides are your need for that choice point and move on. That way, when you get to the end of the game, you have this list of slides you want to show. You can decide how many of those can already be determined from variables you already have, and then the few that don't, you need to go into a dialogue or script and set that variable, so you know that the player made that particular choice, and then you can have that slide come up.

This is something that in Fallout, we scrambled to do it at the end, and then in Arcanum and Temple and vampire, we thought ahead on, and for Outer Worlds, we thought of it right from the very beginning. We were paying attention to things like that. Anyway, I hope this helps you implement endgame slides, and I hope you think of them as a nice bookend to how you choose to begin your game.

Implementing Randomness.md
Youtube Link:

https://youtu.be/DqL9R5PqE20?si=4ZR_0PeSDGtMcvfk

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim. Today I want to talk about randomness. The reason I want to talk about this is randomness is probably the one most logical, mathematically defined, objective, no room for feelings topic that I can imagine that I've had more conversations about with other developers, with fans, with reviewers, with everyone in my entire 42-year career. It is a strange thing. I talked about this in a conference I did in Dubrovnik, reboot 2017. So if you've seen that, that's what I'm going to talk about, but I wanted to kind of go over here because someone asked me to talk about it, and I think it's funny, so I brought this up a lot in the past, so I will talk about it here.

The first story I like to tell was from Fallout. We, Fallout used a linear congruential generator that I took out of a book called numerical recipes in C. It's a very simple, long period, random pseudo-random generator which means it doesn't repeat for a period of time longer than the universe so, and it's got a very good chi-squared value meaning it produces really good random numbers. Still, one day, I believe it was the head of QA, but it might have been one of the QA seniors for Fallout, came into my office and said the random number generator is terrible, you've got to fix it. And I said, tell me what you saw happen, and they said I was standing right next to someone I had a 95% chance to hit them, and I missed. I'm like well, and he goes I missed three times in a row. I'm like well let's do math, I love math. A 95% chance to hit means there's a five percent chance to miss, meaning there's a one in 20 chance you will miss, meaning on average every time you shoot someone, you should expect out of every 20 times to miss once. However, this is a truly randomly generated number every time it is not here's all the numbers from 1 to 20 in a random order and we will re you know we won't reshuffle that until we're in every time you roll that die, you might get a one. So the chance of missing twice in a row is one in 20 squared which is 1 in 400, the chance of missing three times in a row is one in 20 cubed which is one in eight thousand. Now you may go wait a minute, one in eight thousand that's almost never gonna happen well let's look at it this way, if you shoot 20 times in an encounter, and let's say some of them are less than that some of them are way more, if you have 10 encounters an hour because you're in QA and you're constantly playing the game, then that means you're going to shoot about 200 shots an hour, so you work 40 hours a week, wait a minute that's 8,000 shots a week, so you should expect to see your character Miss three times in a row about once a week. I remember he sat and looked at Matthew something's wrong with that and I'm like no you've been playing this game for months I expected you to miss three times in a row many many times and it doesn't matter if I change the random number generator that's gonna happen.

So, the next couple examples I gave were from WildStar because I used to be the programming director on WildStar and I tried to handle the programming cases that were just small and self-contained so I could get them done in a reasonable amount of time and not pull one of my programmers off a bigger feature of the game so one of the things that came up in WildStar was music was repeating, but here's really the story of what happened so the audio director gave me five songs and said play them randomly, okay perfect, so what I would do is when it was time to play a song, I would pick a number from one to five, and I would play it and when it was done I'd pick a number from one to five again, then Play It Again, he came into my office the next day hey, I saw what you did and the problem is I heard song one and then I heard song one again. I was like yep, you sure did, that can happen you know there's a 20% chance you're gonna see a song back to back and he goes well that's not what I wanted. I never want to hear song back to back and I'm like okay, so what I'm gonna do is I want to pick a number from one to five, but if it's the same number as the song I just played I'll just pick again until I get a different number. Now you're never gonna hear the same song Twice, he was in my office the next day well I heard song one and then I heard song two and then I heard song one again I'm like perfect and he was like no I never heard songs three four and five and I'm like you're right I'm doing it randomly he goes well I want to hear all the songs played before you replay one and I'm like that's not random he goes yes it is that's everybody think that's totally random that's the most complete random you can be and I'm like no that means that if you you know after the fourth song you know what song is coming up next because there's only one song that has been played that's completely not random and he goes well that's what I want I'm like okay so here's what I did I would randomize the sequence one through five play it and then re-randomize it, next day he was in my office he goes I can't believe you did it again I heard two songs in a row what he heard was songs two five four one three and then three five one four two notice that three ended the first randomized sequence and began the second, so what did I do I went into the code that randomly shuffled the numbers one through five and when I started to when I made the new Shuffle I remembered what the last song played was and if it showed up in position one, I would swap one with a random the the song in the first location with a song in locations two through five so I just randomly swapped them boom he was happy note what I wrote is not random I did a shuffle which then is played in order so it's not random because the more you go along the more you hear songs the more likely you are to know what's coming up because it's any of the ones that haven't played yet and you're guaranteed you will never hear a song back to back which can happen in Randomness but he was happy, he didn't want random he wanted Shuffle without replacement but we moved on, the design team on WildStar this is what I've said on the programming team a designer came to me and he said hey I need you to redesign the loot system so it has Randomness and I'm like what do you want he goes I want a monster that can drop loot twenty percent of the time and I'm like okay so about one in every five kills you're gonna see Loot drop he goes yes coded it in super simple I know what you're thinking you should have learned by now he didn't want random but I I mean I asked him that's what you want he said yes so he comes in the next day hey I killed 10

 monsters in a row and I never saw Loot drop and I'm like yeah that can happen there's a one in five chance it'll drop you might kill tan he goes well that's not I want, he goes what I want you to do now is every time you kill something if it doesn't drop loot I want you to up the drop chance and I was like okay well I can do that, he came the next day I'm still killing lots of monsters and he wouldn't give me a number but he goes I'm still seeing lots of monsters without saying drops okay what do you want me to do he goes okay in addition to the loot chance that I'm going to specify and the fact that every time you kill a monster and it doesn't drop loot I want you to up that loot chance I want to put in a maximum kill count before it ignores the loot chance and just automatically drops the loot I said okay I put that in he was happy what I did was totally not random I mean it's completely not random you know you will see a Loot drop every end kills 100% of the time it is not random, I thought we were done I'm like I got this Randomness stuff behind me he came to my office two weeks later and said hey I said Critical Hits to 20% but I just shot someone 10 times and didn't get a critical foreign and did the same thing for criticals note that what I was doing took a very simple call to a random number generator with a predefined percent chance did I make this role and instead I had to keep arrays of data around in the music in the music it was all the pre-rolled music that was going to play in the Loot drop case I had to keep how many times this player had killed this type of creature without getting a drop so I could up the loot percent chance by a certain amount or check against a Max kill count keep in mind they may leave and come back it's all the players doing this it's definitely a lot of data keep around it turns out I would say most of the time when a designer or almost anyone but a programmer says to you I went Randomness no they don't Randomness to a programmer means you're rolling some dice taking what the dice show almost all the time what they want are shuffled permutations meaning they want the POS the list of all possibilities that can happen to be enumerated stored shuffled and then when you get into that shuffle reshuffled with some modifications so you don't see the end of the first permutation occur at the beginning of the next permutation permutations are not 100% random they are a random shuffle it's like when you randomize a deck of cards and you start giving out the cards yeah you can't see somebody get the Queen of Spades twice because it's not a random shuffle it is a permutation of the of the deck and until you get to the end of the deck you won't see the same cards again that's why in Vegas they often reshuffle decks uh before they get to the end or they use multiple decks so people can't do card counting Randomness is something that has affected every game I've made it is a funny thing that it's basically an example of smart people using a word that doesn't mean what they think it means and even though you try to get them to use other words you know a few weeks later they're back to hey this isn't random so what I learned as a programmer is to listen to what people wanted and not what they were asking for which by the way is a very good skill when you are also reading reviews and game forms about games you made people will tell you they want something but it's not what they want they want something else either they don't have the vocabulary or the self-reflection or they just can't even put into words what it is they want but frequently people ask for things and it's not what they want they want something else and it takes a while to extract that from them so I hope this helps everybody understand not only the general difficulties of game development but if you're actually a designer or programmer I hope you approach your features a little more openly and a little more non-vaguely you basically need to learn what the terminology means and how to ask for things which are exactly what you want and not well this is what I'm going to ask for and you should figure out what it is I'm asking for but I wouldn't hold your breath that this will change anytime soon this has been happening for decades but I think with a little more forethought I think development can go a little smoothly if people just think about what it is they want how they're expressing what they want

Impostor Syndrome.md
Youtube Link:
https://youtu.be/ht25L6fzEYQ?si=_x-yr5oAGNd_UnbE

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim. Today I want to talk about insecurity, or what I mentioned in a previous video about game conferences—that feeling of imposter syndrome. If you don't know what this is, you're lucky. Impostor Syndrome—it's that general feeling you get that you can't do your job, you can't do it right, you can't do it well, you can't get it done in time, and eventually, you're going to be found out for the fraud you are. But relax, everybody's felt this way at one time or another. I felt that way occasionally. I still do feel that way. I pretty much felt like that way for most of the time for about the first, I want to say, 15 years. I mean, I don't want to—I don't want to make anyone concerned. I don't want to discourage you, but I'd say until the development of Fallout.

**What Causes It**

I always felt like, oh, I don't know if I belong here. I don't know if I'm good enough to be in this group. And keep in mind, I already had uh, Grand sign bridge and Bardstown construction set and Rags to Riches under my belt, so I'd made several games. But that imposter syndrome is a strong feeling. A lot of people get it. I get it. You're gonna get it. So let's just talk about it because I think if you know more about it and the fact that other people feel it, maybe it'll make you feel better.

So what causes it? This is what I think causes it: first of all, if you're in a new job, or game development is new to you professionally, it's totally natural that you're going to have some insecurity about what you're doing. It's a new job. You're not exactly even sure what you're supposed to be doing sometimes. Like I've said, a big chunk of game development is still an art. It's not a science. It's not like you can pick up a book and read it and go, "I'm now a game developer." Some of it, you're gonna have to feel your way through.

Also, game development attracts really smart people, so you're gonna find yourself surrounded by really smart people. I've already mentioned that carbine. I met probably the smartest person I've ever met in my life. But I've all I've constantly encountered people who were better programmers, better designers, or even more specifically, they're better at the particular thing I was trying to do: better AI programmer, better UI programmer, better mechanic game mechanic programmer, better game mechanic designer. You just run into these people, and it's going to keep happening your whole career. So manage that expectation right now.

There's also a problem in the industry that I've mentioned: this comes from reviewers, it comes from game players and fans, it comes from your own colleagues. You're often considered to be only as good as your last game. So if you haven't made a game yet, you're not considered good at all by some of those people. It's like, "Prove it. Prove you should be here doing this." Let me just tell you, that's not going to change even after you get a game out. If you do a bad game, they're like, "Aha, I knew you were bad." If you do a good game, and this has happened to me, they'll go, "Eh, it's a one-off. You're a flash in the pan. It's not gonna happen again." If you make a games and your games are getting better, and you're like, "Okay, I see an upward slope to my ability," people are still going to say things like, "Well, yeah, I think it was you know, it wasn't really you. It was the group. You got in with a good group." Or if your soap ever goes down a little bit, they're like, "Aha, that's it. The decline is set in. You're a fraud. You were always bad. That one, there was a mistake, that one game you made was good." So this is always gonna happen.

So whatever the cause is, these are things that are going to start affecting you and making you think, "Well, maybe I shouldn't be doing this. Maybe this isn't for me."

**They're Wrong**

They're wrong. So I'm just listen, hear me now and believe me later: they're wrong. Everybody has this feeling, except maybe the rare sociopath, but you know who I'm talking about. Let me tell you how it's going to manifest itself and not just in you. Many people handle that nagging insecurity in different ways. This may be happening to you, or maybe happening to people you work with, so maybe you can have a little more empathy for people who behave in some of the ways I'm going to talk about.

So one thing you may just see is a constant struggling. Somebody who's just constantly struggling with what they're doing. They never think it's good enough. They always want to redo it. They never finish it. They do most of it, but then they stop before it's done, and they're like, "No, this isn't right," and they don't want to, you know, dot their I's and cross their T's because then it's done and has to be submitted where they will be judged. So you see this kind of struggling among your colleagues, it's probably because they're insecure about the job they're doing.

**They Redirect**

Sometimes they redirect that outward, and they belittle other people's ideas. So when I talked about brainstorming sessions and I said there were people in there who were constantly putting down other people's ideas, those often turned out to be some of the most insecure people. They weren't sure about their idea, so they're like, "Well, if I put down other people's ideas, even jokingly, maybe mine won't seem as bad," especially if they get angry when their own ideas are critiqued, even if it's critique in a constructive way. If they're getting angry about it, they're probably just insecure, and that's their way of dealing with it. And notice, this isn't limited to Game Dev developers. You see this in game forums all the time. You see people enter these forums, and they have all these brilliant ideas. Now their ideas are bad. They can't believe game developers aren't using their ideas because they're brilliant, and everybody else's ideas are dumb. You especially see this in people who've never ever made a game before. So they're just incredibly—they seem incredibly self-possessed. It's probably that they're incredibly insecure, and that's their projected outward way of dealing with it.

**They Advance**

Sadly, I've seen insecurity manifest itself in how people try to advance. They will often, because they're so worried about their work and their position, they try to advance. I see it as one of two things: either they figure, well, if once I get out of being a junior or even a staff level, I'm a senior or lead, they can't let me go then, they can. So I see people trying to advance, thinking it will make them more secure in

 their job. But I also see them putting down other people and their ideas and, you know, critiquing their work because they want to eliminate competition. They—I've watched people who think someone else is better than them, and they—you can tell they know that, so they try to belittle their work or do anything they can to kind of elevate them above this person that everybody is seeing is really good.

**They Believe**

And then here's an odd thing I've seen, where insecure people often believe whatever lies get told to them because either it makes them feel better, or they see agreeing with a liar as sort of important for their standing at the company, especially if it's someone who's above them. And the reason I've seen this and wonder why people believe these is I've seen people hold things that would be trivial for them to confirm, trivial, like literally, they could ask a person sitting next to them, "Hey, I was just told," and I'm talking about confirmation. I'm told they could be shown documents that are date-stamped, you know, so it's like, "Yes, this idea has been around before," or "Yes, your review was put in," things like that, but they just, for whatever reason, choose to believe the lie that the person told them. Not sure, maybe it confirms their own beliefs, even if it's something that's bad for them.

These are all things you should try to avoid. So let me talk about a little bit about how you can try to combat insecurity because I think just talking about insecurity is not enough unless I give you some tips to how to combat it. If you're an employee, keep in mind, you were hired, you were vetted by people with more experience than you and found adequate or even better than adequate. You were found, "Hey, this is somebody we want on our team." You were vetted. Try to remember that every day. You went through a panel of people with more experience than you, and you were deemed okay. So that right there should help a little bit. But also, talk to your peers, talk to the people you work with. If you're an indie, go to conferences and talk to your peers there because you often find that not only are they thinking some of these things, things that you think, they also have good ways of getting around it, and also just knowing that everybody's kind of in the same boat as you just makes you feel better.

Talk to your boss. I hope you have a good one who can critique your work in a way that you realize they're critiquing it not because your work is bad but because they see potential in it. um, Leonard mentioned this about going to Art School. When he did Art, he often got critiqued, and it brought him down, and then his art teacher said, "Well, I'm critiquing you because you're good, and I think you could be great. There's other people in here that they're just okay, and they're never going to be better than okay, so why would I even give them critiques? They're not going to go anywhere." So view the stuff your boss is telling you as his, his or her effort to get you into being a better game developer. That's their goal. Every boss wants their team to become better, or they should. That's kind of the goal.

If you don't have a boss, or even if you do or if you find you have a bad one, try to find a mentor. I was never overly successful at this, but the industry is way bigger now, and there's a lot of people who've been doing it for a long time. Try to find somebody at your company or at another company who is actively working on something in your area, a programmer who specializes in networking if you're a network programmer, a designer who likes to make RPG mechanics, and that's what you're—you want to do, and just go to them and ask if you can have advice if they can answer questions. Of course, it's easier if that's your own company. You can probably find people at other companies. I would look around for one. Conferences are great too, especially roundtables. You can watch a lot of people who work on one area talk about things. You can find one that kind of aligns with your own game development philosophy and ask them questions.

And then remember one last thing. I've said this a lot. I'm going to repeat it here because I think it's really important for people to hear is failure is an opportunity to improve. If you never fail, you're never going to get that opportunity. I've said this a lot before, but the games I'd made that came out the gate really good, I learned less about being a good game developer from those games than I did from games that came out and got a lot of criticism and lower review scores. When you fail at something, you learn a lot about how to improve. When you succeeded at something, well, I mean, that's good. You did a good job, but you're not really sure how to improve that job and make it better. So just try to view failure as an opportunity to learn and improve, and that also helps deal with some of the insecurity.

I hope this helps, and I hope if you're feeling imposter syndrome, maybe you feel a little less of it now.

Insignificant Features (That I Really Like).md
Youtube Link:
https://youtu.be/fIN8nYjOYEE?si=2VJTVE8OeS5nbe2V

Hi everyone, it's me Tim, and today I want to talk about features that I really notice in games. In fact, let me answer a question from Mike Z 6289 who asks, "What is a feature you see in games that excites you but would seem insignificant to the average gamer?" I think that's a really good question, although I'm not sure exactly who the average gamer is. But before I answer, let me just talk about how I'm going to interpret this question. I interpret this as like what features are personal to me that I notice and I really like but are insignificant. And I think that's an important term. For example, colorblindness support is not insignificant to me. I need it. To a lot of people, they don't know or care about that feature. But I can tell you there have been games that came out recently that are big games that supposedly were quite enjoyable that I literally could not play because they involved solving puzzles with color. This happens every now and then, a game like this comes out. In this case, I actually got to ask the developer why didn't you support colorblindness, and they were like, "Well, we didn't think it was important," and, you know, it wasn't a big deal. And I'm like, okay, so that's like 10% of the male population you just swept under the rug, possibly more. There's a lot of different kinds of color blindness, and there are color blind women as well. So, okay, it's not an insignificant thing to me, so that's not something I would talk about here.

Also, there are some features that I look for not because they make me happy but because the absence of that feature makes me angry. A perfect example is not skipping cutscenes. I can't even put myself in the mindset of a game developer who puts unskippable cutscenes in, as if saying, "Hey, you're playing my game now, and your time is worthless to me." Also, they're saying, "Don't ever replay my game because I can't imagine you doing that; therefore, why would you ever want to skip this cutscene?" When I see a game with unskippable cutscenes, I automatically put it into my "maybe" pile. Like, I might play that; it has to be really, really good. But if they put features like that in that basically belittle my time, why should I even bother playing that game?

So, with that said, now I've talked to you about what's personal to me and what I consider to be insignificant. Let's talk about what I like, what features in a game excite me but most people playing the game would go, "Eh." Probably the biggest one is when NPCs in the game react to little things. I'm not talking about you showing up with a flaming sword or a demonic companion. I'm talking about you wearing a funny hat, and you walk down the street, and one of the passerby goes, "Hey dude, nice hat." I love that because it means that the designer thought of these things and put in the support for something like that to have an NPC have a reaction to something like that. And I mean, we did something like that in Arcanum, where if you ran around without clothes on because it's a Victorian-themed game, people should react to you being naked or as naked as you can get. So, I like if I take off all my clothes and I walk by someone, and they go, "Hey, you forget your pants?" Now, I'm going to caveat that with I don't expect everybody to comment about it all the time. I don't want to walk down the street and go, "Hey, where your pants? Forget your pants? Where are your pants? Hey, you're not dressed." But I think sometimes a few people should, and I particularly like it when the comments are unique to that type of NPC. For example, if I walk into a clothing vendor, I would love it if they said, "Hmm, I suppose you're here today to buy pants." That's funny because they're recognizing that I'm not wearing any pants, and they're a clothing vendor, so they're willing to sell me some pants. I like that stuff. It basically is the designer going, and I like that. It makes the game much more charming to me.

Some other things, though, and by the way, Mike Z, I thought about this for a long time. I know you asked this a few weeks ago, but I've been thinking about it because I knew there were features that I simply adore, but I, once I thought of that NPC reaction one, I really had to scratch my head. The next one I thought about, though, was when the mini-map or local area map is really nice and not just a camera that's put above the player's head. I like it when it's themed somehow for the game. So, like, if it's a sci-fi game, if it looks like a projection or contour map, if it's a dungeon, like I loved Ultima Underworld's map because it looked like a scroll, and it looked like you were writing on it, and we took notes, a little scroll appeared, and you took notes on it in handwriting. I love that stuff because you use that mini-map a lot, and they've gone the extra mile to theme it and make it useful. By the way, when mini-maps aren't useful, when they're like, you know, just not something you frequently use because it's just not very useful, it's easier just to remember where things are in your head, I question why do you even have the mini-map.

Inventory is something that frequently makes me unhappy in RPGs because you're always finding a ton of items. And if you're not finding a ton of items, I get unhappy for a different reason. So, I like when role-playing games, in particular, make it very easy for me to either store an item, knowing I want to sell it later, or mark an item in my inventory as the next time I go to a vendor, I want to sell them. And then when I get to the vendor, make it very easy to like, sell all my junk, or sell everything marked here, or sell everything in this tab because it's just, it's the game recognizing that there's a lot of things that you pick up just to sell. And again, it's the going, so I like that. I think it's a really cool thing to add as a layer on top of the inventory system.

Similarly, for all you level designers out there, I love it when there are little stories told in the game's scene. I call these vignettes. I don't know if there's a name for them. And you're telling that story purely with props, in other words, there are no books, no notes, no dialogue, none of my companions wai and go, "I think what happened here." No, I just want to be able to look and see a little story being told. I've mentioned this before, but when I was playing Fallout 3, and I was going through a hotel, I found a room that was locked, and when you went inside, there were two skeletons lying on the bed holding hands, and you just knew what happened

 here. And I loved it. I love that there wasn't a note saying, "Goodbye cruel world, Betty and I have decided to die here in the hotel room." I don't need to know that. In fact, I prefer not to know it. I'll make it up in my head. But for level designers, when they go out of their way to kind of tell a little story with props that already existed, that you've seen other places, especially, you know, if it's not a unique prop but it's just they've arranged props in a way that just made you go, "I think I know what happened here." And even if you're wrong, it doesn't matter. In fact, I love the ones that I can think of the story of what happened.

Mechanically speaking, I love in a game when I'm not forced to level up as soon as I gain the XP for it. And I know some people like this, and some people's favorite games have this. I just don't like it when, and I know this seems insignificant, but that was part of the question, when I get the XP, and it should just go, "Boom, by the way, you can level now if you want." And then I can keep gaining XP, and everything's fine, and then when I feel like it, I will level up. And that way, I may maybe go up two or three levels before I level up. I like that because frequently you get XP at a time that's not good, like you're fighting something, and you gain some XP for killing something, and then bam, the game pauses right in the middle of combat to give you XP. Or I've seen games at the end of combat, that's when they pause, so you get XP for killing things, and then as soon as combat's over, it goes, "Boom, level up now." And you're like, "I really wanted to go loot these things. I'm thinking about looting, and you're making me think about leveling up." Plus, I like to think about what I want to level up, so I don't want to do it right now when I'm standing in the middle of a combat field. So, that's a feature that I just love seeing.

And then similarly, with another mechanic, I love it when perks exist that aren't about directly making the perk more powerful, but instead, they exist to broaden the perk's use. So yeah, I get it when there's a perk that says you do 10% more damage, you do 30% more damage. I get it. What I really like are seeing perks that are like, "Hey, you know that perk you like using? You want to use it more?" For example, if you have a perk, if you're selling items to a vendor, and you get a perk that says you can now sell any type of item, so you go to an armor who normally only buys armor, and now you can sell anything to that vendor. I love perks like that. Or you can now sell stolen items to this vendor. Love stuff like that because it makes something I'm doing in the game more commonly applicable. Persuasion, which normally only works on people, if you have a persuasion skill, I love when you get one saying you can now use this, now works on monsters or robots or something else in the game that normally you would think, "How would I use persuasion on this thing?" I love when that happens, and when perks broaden their use.

So those are most of the examples I could think of of features that just made me go, "I love that." I love that. Overall, the rule here about what it is I like seeing is, I love a designer who talks to me through their work. I kept doing, you know, they do this. If a designer is telling me, "Hey, I see you. I see what you like doing. I put some stuff in that lets you do it more. Here you go." That's what I like seeing. That's what I like seeing from a game, when the designer speaks to me through his design in a nice way.

So, Mike Z, I hope that answers your question, and I hope that gives you a better idea of what features, insignificant features I see in games that still excite me.

Interplay After Hours Game Playing.md
Youtube Link:
https://youtu.be/bcr3mMStEOE?si=y4agyg05QCCp8hl7

Hi everyone, it's Tim. In previous videos, I've talked about playing D&D, GURPS, and LP MUDs. In this video, I want to talk about how my game playing really took off when I started Interplay. Now, I thought I was a game player as a kid, you know, in high school and college, but nothing prepared me for just how much game playing went on at Interplay after I started. Now, this is pretty much after I got hired, so in early '92 to about when Fallout kicked into high gear in '95, which also corresponds to about the time we switched buildings. Interplay had four buildings in the six years I was there: Susan, Fitch, Alton, and Von Carmen. By far, the most game playing I remember doing was in The Fitch Building, probably because by the time we moved to Alton, it was hard to get everybody together, and in Von Carmen, we were just, you know, noses to the grindstone on Fallout.

The Susan building, which was where I was originally hired into, I was upstairs in a foyer, um, between stuck between two producers. People from QA would shoot paper clips at me, including Eric to Milt, who would later on become producer Fallout 2, my producer at Carbine, and at Obsidian. The Fitch Building, he's only 18, so kind of some slack, um, he and a bunch of other people, they were... when you come to Interplay at night, there were always people there. You could drop by Interplay at 10 pm on a random day, Sunday night, there would be people there. Sometimes they were working, sometimes they were just playing. By the time we got to the Fitch Building, though, I think the reason things really took off is everybody was in one building, big L-shaped building, and there was a wonderful conference room that had a big circular table which is perfect for gaming at.

There was also a racquetball court, and I'd play racquetball a lot at UCI, so I started a racquetball newsletter. I called myself Dr. Racket Head. We had a ladder, people would play and tell me who won, and I'd adjust the ladder every week. But what that meant was I was mailing a lot of people I didn't normally talk to. I mean, there were two people I was pretty good at racquetball, sometimes I was on the top tier, even in the top slot, but there was an accountant, Larry Fukoca, and one of the VPs, Phil Adam, who could crush me every game. And I actually like that because it's fun to play with people who are so good. I learned so much just watching them crush me. So that was fun, but it also meant I met a lot more people. I was being a lot more social than I normally was.

**Board Games**

We started playing lots of different games, not just role-playing games, but board games, card games, dice games. We had done it a little bit in the Season building. I kind of remember playing Wiz War a little bit in that building, was a little board game that you assemble the board. I've talked about it, Wizards try to collect Treasures or kill other Wizards. We played it so much more when we moved to the Fitch Building, and we played it so much that we started inventing our own cards. We invented so many that we mailed them back to Jollygames, Tom Jolly made the original Wiz War and then went to Chess X, but we mailed them all of our instructions for the cards, and that was fun. I mean, we were just so into it. That was the time I was making all my group's apps, the star system generator, the character editor.

We actually had a weekly meeting called the Thursday Night Thing. Now, like I said, you could come any day, there any day of the week, and there would be people there, but Thursday Night Thing was kind of a planned thing. Everybody would stop it there doing around seven, seven-thirty, go out and grab food, and we'd meet back in the conference room around that big round table, and we would play games every week. It felt like we just did different things. A huge thing was playing with Atari Lynxes, which was a really cool little handheld color multiplayer. Most of their games could multiplayer to five or six, some of them like Todd's Adventure in Slime World could go up to eight. We played those games so much that we had developed a pattern to how to connect our wires together because they were wired, they weren't wireless.

**Multiplayer Games**

If everybody brought a cord, we would call a star pattern, where everybody just threw it into the center, and we connected them together. That meant it easy for people to leave because they could just unplug theirs and connect the two neighbors. However, there was one person, who knew who you are, Wes, who wouldn't buy a cable. So when he came, we had to do a ring pattern where everybody connected to the person to the right, and it went around, and then for n people to do a ring, you only needed n minus one chords. Yes, we got really nerdy about figuring out patterns of connection. We played so many of these multiplayer games. Multiplayer wasn't that big in PC, there were a few multiplayer games. I mean, Doom and Quake were coming into their own, but it was so much fun to play these little Lynx games with each other.

And we played a ton of Wiz War. We also played Bomberman on this Ness. We had this Ness multitap that connected to the second player port, which let four more people join, so you could have five people play one game. Now, the American Bomberman only had four people, they would start in each corner. The Japanese Plumber Man, not only had different characters, but there was a fifth person who could start in the middle. We played that game so much. We had terms, if you, when you started, usually you're in a corner, and you could only go left or right. If you dropped your bomb before you went left to right, it would blow up down those two hallways and kill yourself. We call that corner heading. We had all these terms, everybody had favorite characters. It was a great multiplayer game because so many people could play it once, and if there were more than five people, a game only lasted a few minutes, and we had rules like there were a lot of people waiting, if you won, you stayed, and the other four people had to get up and let other four people join. Sometimes we only had one or two people waiting, and then the rule was they took the position of whoever died first in the round, which was sometimes hard to tell because one bomb could take out multiple people at the same time.

**My First Experience**

That was also my experience, my first experience. I played group supers, but we played champions, which was a tabletop role-playing game that's only about supers. I still remember my character. I think Spencer Kype, who was originally going to be the lead artist on Fallout, he ran the session, but I wanted a character who just had luck. I was fascinated by luck, and I think this is

 what influenced me, wanting luck in Fallout. There were so many levels of luck you could buy, that that determined how frequently and how good your luck was. I had this character buy them all. Luck, ridiculous luck, extraordinary luck, super luck, he had all of them. Effectively what that meant was every time he rolled, he'd roll three times and take the best. If anyone attacked him, they take three rolls and take the worst.

Now, to buy all this luck was really expensive because they made it very expensive. This is a powerful ability. My character had to take a lot of disadvantages. I had him take youth, he was 14. Poor, missing leg, missing arm, missing eye, and, and this is in the roles, so no offense to anyone, and yes, I had speech therapy as well when I was in the lunch school, stuttering. His name was Lucky Boy. Everyone was afraid of Lucky Boy, even the other superheroes were afraid. So we kind of had a rule. We all belong to a city superhero council, I forget what we called it. When a villain would attack the city, the other superheroes would shoot off to that villain. They'd fly, they'd teleport, they'd run at super speed, leaving Lucky Boy at the headquarters.

Now, Lucky Boy couldn't drive, he didn't have driver's license, he was 14, but Lucky, and he was poor, but Lucky Boy had a bus pass. So he would get on the bus, often having to take transfers. So Lucky Boy would always arrive late, and our rule was if the other heroes could take care of the villain before Lucky Boy got there, great. If he was still, if the villain was still rampaging by the time Lucky Boy arrived, everybody backed up. Lucky Boy would get off the bus and just walk up to the building and like try to punch him or something. Now, keep in mind, Lucky Boy would often get critical, so even though he wasn't strong, and he was missing an arm, and he had to hop over with, he only had a missing leg, and he couldn't afford prosthetics because he was poor, he would punch him and often get a critical, and it would say like knock him down or knock him back.

Eventually, the villain would get really mad and aim one of his attacks at Lucky Boy. That was the villain's huge mistake. They'd roll three times, they'd almost always fail, but they would usually critically fail. Heat beams would get reflected back onto the villain, things they'd throw, they'd drop and hurt themselves. Grenades they'd throw would slip and explode at their feet. If they had other, like, super breath or any other superpowers, it would somehow malfunction and mess them up. Several times villains would basically hurt themselves, the other superheroes would just sit back and let them knock themselves out. But occasionally would, they'd get so hurt from Lucky Boy that one of the other superheroes could just come up and go, okay, I've grabbed you. That was the funniest character. It was also fun because the DM got to figure out how Lucky Boy's luck manifested. I loved it, went into Fallout.

That's my point of this entire story, you never know where your ideas are going to come from. You never know what hobby, what fun activity, something you didn't plan to do, but your friends are doing, and you do it too. I did a whole talk about how Disneyland expired, inspired my level design. You just never know. You're always the design part of your brain is always going to be going, day and night, at work, at work after hours, at Disneyland. I love that. I love that part of design, that there's some part of your brain that's always thinking about things and chewing on stuff.

If you want to be a designer, just, all I can say is stay open to that. Don't focus just on video games. Don't focus just on the genre of video games you make. I make RPGs, but I play a lot of different things. You never know what element you're going to see somewhere that will inspire you in your game, and who knows, you may be the first person to do that in your game genre. You might not, but you might have a new and fresh take on it. That's what's important. So yeah, this really long set of stories had that as its motto, which is just stay open, keep yourself open to all the different experiences you have, and see how that can work in your games, because it will.
Title:
Issues And How To Fix Them.md

https://youtu.be/Cm1jgmklaro?si=H0S7vD7GOupm7OAU

Hi everyone, it's me Tim, and today I not only want to talk about issues that come up in game development but how to fix them. I know it's dark, but Uncle Tim's got a lot of work to do today, so I had to film this early. Dawn is still about oh, 20 minutes away. So, I've talked about a lot of issues on this channel, some that generated a great deal of comments and conflicting comments, things about work-life balance, and crunch, stuff about team size, project length, the video I made on game developer caution. So, before I start talking about how I think we should talk about solving some of these, let's just talk about those videos and kind of a context around them.

First of all, if you go back and look at the video and listen carefully, I'm not blaming any group for those causes, for those problems. I'm careful to avoid that. I'm careful to say these are the things that happened, but I don't say why and I don't say whose fault it is. But if you look at the comments, people are really quick to judge, you know, they're really quick to go oh, that was a bad person, that employee was horrible, that boss was horrible. Let me just tell you this, there are some people I've worked with who think I'm great to work with and want to work with me again. There are some people who think I'm awful to work with, and I'm the perfect example of a bad boss, and they never want to work with me again. So, who's right? Maybe they're both right. For some of you, I think I would be great; you would love working with me, we'd have fun, and we'd make a great game. Others, you would probably think I'm awful, you'd be like, oh my God, he's terrible, he just never stops coming at you with ideas, and he never gives me five seconds, and it's just, he's awful to work for. I get it.

This is, by the way, sometimes when people tell me they're looking for a new job and they want to switch companies, the advice I give them is based on them as much it is any company they want to look at. But let me just say that I get it, I get why people feel this way because I have my own lens of how I view things. I like that word, it's a more recent word I used to say perspective or my nuance or whatever, but I have my lens, and you, if you watch some of my previous videos, you'll watch that I never assume someone's bad at their job, I never assume anyone is feeling insecure about what they're doing, I really just talk about what people do.

This was pointed out to me by somebody I used to work with at Interplay, and he reminded me of the racquetball story. We used to have a racquetball court at Interplay, and I used to play a lot of racquetball, I used to be pretty good at it too. I was playing another Interplay employee, a friend of mine, and it wasn't going well for him. I think it was like 21, I won the first game like 21 to 6, and he got really mad. He said, "My racket's horrible, this racket sucks, I hate it." So, I walked up to him and I grabbed his racket and I handed him mine, and I went back and I served, and we played another game. Didn't ask him to do it, just started playing another game. I won like 21 to 4, he threw the racket, which by the way was my racket, he was holding my racket on the floor, and stormed out. And I didn't understand what had happened. So, when I was back at my desk, I went and talked to somebody, by the way, it was Eric the Milt, who was later on the producer for Fallout 2, and I worked with him at Carbine, I worked with him at Obsidian, he was the producer on Outer Worlds, very good friend of mine, and he said, "You don't understand what you did. His bad racket was a good excuse for him, and you ripped that away from him. You made him realize that you were just beating him fair and square." And I was like, "But wouldn't he want to know that and play and get better?" And he was like, "No, he wanted to blame his racket."

Why am I telling you that story? Why I mentioned lenses, everybody has their lens, and it colors everything they see. You have it, I have it, everybody has it. I try to avoid my lens as much as possible by taking notes and only reporting what people did and said, but even then, I have a lens. Here's the lenses I see being applied to my stories that I tell here on this channel. The big one is heroes and villains. People will hear the story and despite me telling them not to do this, immediately say, "Well, that's the good guy, and that's the bad guy. This is the hero, and that's the villain. She was the hero, and he was the villain." It was like, it's always Heroes and villains. Some people, they can't understand that some people sometimes do something bad but are usually good, and some people are usually bad but occasionally do really, really good things, and you can appreciate them for doing those good things.

Another one that I see a lot, that's why I did the ageism video, is people love to put everything as young and old. "Oh, that's just what old people think," or "All young people now are blah, blah, blah." No, I've worked with some phenomenal people over my career. I've gone from being the youngest person in the room at 16 to being the oldest person in the room at 58. I've seen young people do stupid things, I've seen older people do stupid things, I've seen projects, I want to say, saved and rescued by a young person having a brilliant idea. I've seen the same thing happen when an old person said, "You know what helps in this situation?" and they have wisdom and experience, and that helps too. So, that lens really annoys me because I'm like, some people just use it on everything, they just apply it to everything. "My car broke down, somehow a young person is responsible."

There's also a real common lens of hardworking versus lazy. People think that some people are incredibly hardworking and some people are lazy. The problem with that is some people have a lot of energy, but then the work output they have is low, or the work they make isn't very good, while some people think a lot before they act, and then they think for an hour and then they create in 10 minutes a wonderful diamond piece of code or art. From the outside, sometimes they look lazy and hardworking, and sometimes they don't. It's a bad lens.

And a similar lens is, and I see people doing this all the time, it's a much more recent one of employer versus employee. I see people assume, "Well, that's the employer, he's bad, he's evil, everything bad came from

 the employer." And then I see people going, "Nope, employees are lazy, employees are terrible." Thank you, Windows. And that's not good either. Once you start doing this employer or employee schism, you will miss out on problems that exist right in front of your face because you're assuming the wrong cause.

So, let's talk about that, let's talk about how to solve some of the problems that come up, and I'm talking about crunch, I'm talking about game developer caution, I'm talking about estimating time to do things. First of all, there's three steps. The first step is to agree on what the problem is. You would think this would be easy, but I sometimes see people deny that there even is a problem. They're like, "No, everything's fine, this, this thing that you think is bad is, it's normal." It's that meme of the dog drinking tea while everything's on fire and saying, "I'm fine." Some people don't even acknowledge there's a problem, some people think the problems are different, you know, "Oh, that's managers being evil," "Oh no, that's employees being lazy." So, you have to first of all agree on what the problem is, that's step one.

Then step two is to agree on the cause. So, like when I was talking about crunch, some people are like, "Well, the cause is just bad management, it's always bad management, and I will hear nothing else." Other people are like, "Nope, lazy employees, not getting their stuff done, talking around the water cooler for hours, and then going, 'Oh no, I have something I have to finish today.'" Let's just say that there's a number of causes, but until you agree on what they are, you're never going to fix anything. And that, I think, is one of the hardest steps, is to agree, even if you agreed that there's a problem, agreeing on the cause is often very hard to get people together on.

And then step three, agree on what the solution is. Some people will think, "Oh, it's we need more time, we need more people, we need more money." Actually, all those are probably money. Some people think we need a clearer design, other people are like, "No, we wasted so much time on design that we need to dive in and do rapid prototyping, and you know, people call it like rapid failure, like make lots of little mini versions of the game until you get one that feels right, and then expand out from there." Until you have people agree on what the solution is, you can agree on the problem and even agree on the cause, but if you don't agree on the solution, you're not going to fix anything.

So, those are the three big things: agree on the problem, agree on the cause of the problem, agree on the solution. Now, I've pointed out a number of problems on this channel, and I've given my guesses as to the problems and a few ideas for the solutions, but guess what? As I pointed out, I have my lens too, and I'm leaving the industry, I'm backing out of it. You guys are going into it, or you're thinking about going into it, or you're just like looking at it. You have to figure these things out, these are on you now. I can give you this general advice, but you're going to have to figure out how to do these. My recommendation, and I've said this, is take lots of notes. You will literally go back to some of your notes and go, "I don't remember that. I don't remember saying that. I don't remember doing that. I didn't remember him doing that. I don't remember her saying that." Take lots of notes, start now. But the other one thing is, try not to be myopic. So, to put it back into this lens connotation, try to step back sometimes from your lens, try to at least be aware your lens is there. If you can't stop doing something, be at least aware that you're doing it. And of all things, try not to always assume that there is one thing that is the cause of all the problems you're seeing. I guarantee you, nothing is that simple. There is no root cause to all the problems. There may be a big problem causing a lot of issues, but I guarantee you that sometimes the cause of the problem is something different than what you're thinking. So, just kind of try to be open to that, try to look at problems fresh, try to see what other people think the problems are because you might be wrong, and then talk to them about what they think the causes are, and try to root out what the issues are that are there because sometimes there may be multiple causes. One person may think it's employees, and one person may think it's employers, and you both may be right. Maybe those two groups are talking past each other.

But I think if you sum up, because I know I'm talking a lot, if you agree on the problem, and then agree on the cause, and then agree on the solution, that will solve so many issues that are coming up now. And you can get there by taking a lot of notes and being aware of whatever perspective, whatever lens that you constantly seem to fall back on, and trying to at least view it from other perspectives, at least a little bit, to get a better view of what's going on. So, that's the best advice I can give for game development and its problems. So, I'm going to go back to design and code stories and solutions, but I wanted to do this just to get all that off my chest. Hope it helps.

It's A Great Time To Be A Game Player.md
Youtube Link:
https://youtu.be/KNhdh6QxPs8?si=d2F8lLhCrlW4-EMU

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim. Today, I want to talk about why this is such an amazing time for game players. It doesn't always seem that way, but I'm gonna lay it out.

First of all, there are amazing games coming out. I'm not going to list them because for each one of you, it's different. It's because there are so many games coming out that there are good games for you. Not every game will be for you, but there are games coming out today that child Tim could have only dreamed of playing in the 80s.

There are fantastic consoles. The PS5 and the Xbox Series X are really powerful, amazing consoles. There are amazing ways of getting games. I mean, you all know what Steam is, and Steam is great. Steam has great sales, and it's a great way to have a huge library of games, but you don't have to have them locally. But you have the Epic Game Store, which literally gives away free games every week, really good games. You have Good Old Games, which is preventing a lot of older games from slipping away into unplayable obscurity. All of these are great ways of archiving your library in case something happens to your computer, or, you know, the disks become unreadable, which used to happen with the old floppy disks and even CD-ROMs.

Now, yes, there are so many good games out that you often have to dig to find them. I call this the signal to noise ratio getting too low. But it's the negative way of looking at it. The positive thing is it's because there are so many games. There's a surplus of games, a virtual Cornucopia of games. It's there are so many out there, and yet, I see people getting jaded about the industry. And yes, there are some things that are valid to be getting jaded about.

Microtransactions are becoming common. I don't want to say they're frequent, but when they exist, there's no longer any uproar about it. I'm thinking, yeah, that game has things you can buy with Microsoft. There's also a lot of DLC that comes out that you're like, "This looks like it should have been part of the game," and instead, it got carved out and turned into DLC like it wasn't, it didn't look like it was made separately from the main game. And don't even get me started on anything that's pay to win, where you can spend money to get anything that's not cosmetic. If you can spend money to get skills or better weapons or better armor, that's not cool.

But I see a lot of people getting upset about the fact that games are out that have a political or social or moral belief that isn't reflecting how you feel. And all I can tell you is that's always been the case. You're just seeing it now because there's a lot more games out there. But that's the good thing. You can just buy the games that matter to you. You can just buy the games that reflect your own beliefs back at you. But I like the fact that diversity inside games has become so broad that if you want to play someone who looks like you, who talks like you, who acts like you, you can find a game that does it.

But another reason I wanted to talk about this today is there has never been a better time, an easier time to interact with game developers as there is right now. I'm not talking about me, although this is true for most of my career, you just couldn't leave a comment and hope that I reply or even do a whole video about it. But there are other developers who are doing that as well. I'm not the only one here on YouTube, or on Twitch, or Discord, who are doing things like this. You basically have never had more bandwidth into game development and game developers than you have right now.

However, there are a lot of game developers who don't want to do this. Now, there are some that can't, either they work at a company that's like, "Your NDA covers everything that you would ever want to talk about," but there's a lot that don't want to do it because this particular situation can quickly become toxic. And I'm not even talking about most of you. It's just a fraction, but, you know, I used to go to game forums a lot more 20 years ago because it was a great way of interacting with fans who were really into the games. So, I appreciated the knowledge and the perspective, I guess now that we call it the lens, the lens that they have on even my own games was very educational for me. I learned what people really liked about my games and what they really didn't like about my games, and both of those can be constructive.

However, now when I go to forums, it's usually just the absolute loudest voices in that group declaring that what they know is right and that everyone else is stupid. And I don't know what they hope to get out of that because that certainly doesn't make a discussion happen, and it certainly doesn't lead any game developer to go, "Now I know exactly what to do in my game." So, that's just kind of a waste of time, and that's when I declared, several when the signal to noise ratio drops too low, that's when I tap out.

But it's funny to me, the lack of self-reflection that some people have because I've seen people complain about video games where all the NPCs are snarky, and they think to themselves, "Snark is not a replacement for a personality." And the first thing I think is, you just described a lot of game forums. And by the way, I've had this discussion with game narrative designers, with writers, who seem to think the only way to write an interesting character is to write a character who's a jerk to the NPC. And you see this happen all the time. I think it's inexperience because I see it more in junior narrative designers, where when they're asked to come up with an interesting character, it's usually a character who's super sarcastic and is exists seems to exist in the game world to give the player the what for. And they think, "Wow, that character has got a lot of character," and I usually just think, "This is the 19,000th time I've seen someone write this. It's actually really boring." So, you can only imagine what I feel like when I go into a game development board, and there's somebody being snarky, and I think, "Wow, that's super original. I've never seen anyone make sarcastic comments like that before. Wow."

So, what I see really happening is there is an incredible wasted opportunity on a lot of boards, channels for actually having a real discussion with game developers, which has never happened before. It does not happen before in this industry. It's happening now because of the vast nature and variety of discussion platforms out there. Twitch is a little different than Discord, which is different than YouTube, which is different than any other kind of social media that's out there. They're all have their pros and cons, but it lets you basically listen to developers and give feedback. And by the way, while I'm on the topic of feedback, let me just remind you, it's a lot

 better to tell developers what you want them to do, then what you don't want them to do. I know it's easier, and it feels cathartic to go, "Your NPCs are stupid, and your combat is dumb, and I hated your combat, and your crafting was the worst thing I ever saw, blah, blah." What's a lot better, because that doesn't tell them what to do, it just tells them you think this stuff is dumb. If instead, you said, "I wish there was more, there was more choices I was given in dialogues, and that those choices mattered in the game. I wish that there was more crafting with things I'm already finding in the world, so I wish weapons and armor could be broken down into materials that I could then craft with because I'm already finding those and sometimes I want them, and then I don't know what to do with the ones I don't want." That is a lot more constructive than just saying, "Uh, their crafting is dumb."

But all you also have to bear in mind, because I know the price of games is becoming a talking point lately, which is surprising to me, because games cost about 60 or 70 dollars now, and they used to cost that much 20 or 30 years ago. I don't know why this is the one thing in the world that isn't being allowed to gradually increase in price, or in the case of food, not so gradually increase in price. But just keep in mind that when you ask developers to do more and more features, you have to accept that it either means there's going to be less of other features, or it's going to take them more time, or they're going to have to hire more people, which basically translates into more money, and eventually, that's going to be reflected in the price you pay for the game.

Instead, what I'm seeing on almost every form of social media that game developers go to, I see mostly Rants and tirades from people, which basically translates into fewer developers doing this. I'm not even saying it's all of you. I'm not even saying it's most of you. In fact, it's a tiny fraction of you. I will admit, people leave the most wonderful, amazing comments on my channel. I love the fact that my games have gotten you through rough times. I love the fact that one of my games is the first thing you remember playing with your one of your parents, or it's the first time you felt like you really got into a game, or it's the most memorable game for you, or you discovered one of my games, and then you wanted to play a lot more because they have a similar vibe. I love reading that. But then there's a few people just make a bad situation because it seems like all they want to do is go into a board and rant, and I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do with it. So, I'll be honest, I usually just ignore that stuff because I don't know what I'm going to do with it. So, I look at it and like, "This guy's having a bad day," and I toss it.

But one thing I always want to remind people is a lot of bad situations in the world were created by a few people who do this. If you wonder why you get so much spam in your email, because you never, you know, answer spam, well, a few people do. And because those few people answer spam, and it pays off, we all get a lot of spam. It's like what happened with the airlines in the last 20 or 30 years. Used to be, you got an airline, you had a pretty decent seat, you got fed a meal, even if you were back in coach, you could carry on bags. But what happened was, especially after people could look for prices online, is people always went to the lowest price. And Airlines discovered, well, if we got rid of all these things and then put them back as added fees, we're getting more people because people only look at the lower price. They don't think of, well, yeah, I won't get fed on the plane, so I'm going to be spending 20 bucks at the airport for a really bad Burger beforehand, and I'm gonna, I wanna, I don't want to check my bag anymore, so I'm gonna have to rush on to try to stuff it into an overhead bin rather than have it checked at the gate because I don't want to pay, you know, the 20 or whatever. So, it's led to the airline having this menu-driven thing that was created by a few people driving the airline into this situation that now we all live in. So, I'm just trying to say, if you step back and look at the huge breadth and scope and depth of video games available today, they're amazing. This is an amazing time to be a game player. Yeah, it could be better. I hope I've explained some things you can do to help make it better, but let me trust me, almost everything used to be worse. There used to be a lot more horrific games that you didn't know were horrible until you plopped out your 60 bucks and got them home. This is awful. There used to be a lot of games that were, you know, you, after you, you got home, you found out it was a great game, but it was two hours long, or it didn't run in your system, but the store doesn't take it back because you broke open the packaging. I mean, Steam now lets you return things after you've played it for a while. This is a great time to be a game developer. I mean, it's a good time to be a game developer, but it's a great time to be a game player. It's really good.

I'm telling you this to encourage you to enjoy the games that are out there, that you can find that obviously are for you, and then in the places where you do have bandwidth with game developers, take advantage of it. Every game developer, anyone wants to be a better game developer, and you can help them. Yelling at them is not going to help them. Being constructive, telling them what you like, and what you wished, the systems that you didn't like, what you wish they could do, that is way better, and in the long term, we'll reward you with much better games.

So, I hope you're excited about all the games that are out now, and you take more advantage of active game developers who are available online.

Learning Lessons From Failure.md

https://youtu.be/Kh5JMp5_5nQ?si=b7sa2BE7l3MQb7cN

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim. So I've been telling a lot of stories. I'm gonna consider this kind of a summary video so far. I wanted to talk about lessons I've learned, and specifically for this video, I want to talk about the lessons I've learned by failing, not by success, because I think I've learned more from failure than from success. A very specific example of that is Fallout was very successful in many ways, but I did not realize parts of its success that I just stumbled into or got lucky with, as opposed to things that I was actually good at. So I left Fallout thinking, for example, I wrote the intro cinematic, the narration by Ron Perlman, the "war, war never changes" intro. It turned out people really liked that and turned out to be really popular, it turned out to be enduring. So, you know, a couple of years later, maybe more like three years later, when I started making Temple of Elemental Evil, I thought, you know what, I'm a good writer. I'm gonna write dialogue. Nope. I am not a good writer, or to be specific, there are some things I write well and some things I write poorly. Short, specific, directed text like in an intro to a cinematic, like portions of manuals because I wrote portions of a big chunk of the Arcanum manual, some of the Fallout lore that you found like the FEV data about it being a viron, that kind of stuff I write well. Dialogue, conversation, character, I do not write well, but I did not know that until I finished Temple, and it got panned for its characters, and I'm like, wait a minute, I thought I was a good writer. Am I not a good writer? It took me years to figure out that distinction between I'm not overall a good writer, but there are some things that I write well. Learning that nuance took years and took me way beyond the success of Fallout or even Arcanum. It took the failure of Temple before I even started realizing that there was a nuance there.

Another thing that failure taught me is that a team-wide acceptance of the vision of the game you're making is not easy to get and it's not easy to maintain. Again, with Fallout, I didn't learn that lesson because even though it was the biggest team I'd worked on so far, we all just sort of gelled. It was everybody who worked on it kind of understood the direction it was going. Before then, I had made games with very small teams, so either getting that vision was easy because when there's only two people, and you split the work, your vision kind of dominates whatever the portion of the work you're doing. It wasn't until Arcanum where I thought we were all making the same game and there was some fracturing that happened. I'll do a video about that later. There were some really huge arguments that happened during the making of Arcanum with the same people I made Fallout with. So it took me a while, it took me years to figure out, to tease apart what was the difference, what happened, and the bottom line was, you may have an idea of what the game is, but it may not align with what everybody making the game's idea is, and getting that vision communicated to everybody and agreed upon by everybody is very hard. It's very hard. That I understood by the time I did Outer Worlds, and so I was much better equipped to talk to designers and programmers and artists about what we were trying to do.

Related to that, something that you learn after you have many games under your belt, some of which did well and some of which didn't, there's an old, old, I believe it's Roman, it's like thousands of years old, there's an expression that I did not learn until years later called "success has many fathers, but failure is an orphan." What this means is when you make a game that does well, everybody wants a claim in it. Everybody, people will come out of the woodwork that you don't even know, that you've never seen before, like, who are you? "Oh well, I put the second ad together after the game shipped with the text, you know, 'buy mutants' or something on it," and you're like, um, okay. Everybody wants a piece of something that they think is going to become a great thing, and that makes sense. The flip side, though, is if you make a game that isn't good, people just walk away. People who would bang down your door yelling at you for not saying their name in an interview don't care what you say about the bad game. In fact, they'd prefer you not to mention them, even if they had more work in the bad game. So that's why I often tell people that Temple is my bomb. It's the lowest metacritic score of any game I've done, but I liked it. I liked that game. I love D&D, I love tabletop D&D, it's a really good representation of tabletop D&D. My writing is not good, and that drags it down, and I get it, and it shipped with bugs, almost all my games have. Outer Worlds didn't, but. So that's why I learned, when you make a good game, everybody will be coming at you, and why don't you, why aren't you mentioning me, why aren't you mentioning. By the way, sometimes I flip this on people and go, I've never heard you once mention me. I've never heard you once give a compliment about anything I did. In fact, I backed somebody in the corner once and said, name one thing I contributed to this game that I was just the director on, and they couldn't do it. So you got to balance this, yes, everybody, it makes sense that everybody wants to be a part of something big, and they want to shy away from what they think are the problem games, but let me remind you, the theme of this video, I've learned more about how to make good games from my bad ones.

Which leads me into the next thing I want to talk about, which is taste. Taste is subjective. It is, for most of you hearing this, you're like, oh yeah, of course, and somebody's going, no, I think it's, no, but even those of you who think it's objective, you often don't act like it is. I will get, I talk about this when I get feedback on my games, and they say, well, this is dumb. Not only is that unconstructive, and I had a whole video talking about how that's stupidly unconstructive, but it's a taste thing. When somebody said, I don't like the look of this, okay, lots of people do. And I mentioned once, it's like walking into an ice cream parlor, a famous one that offers, you know, 31 flavors or something, and saying, well, these are the only three good ones. Well, obviously, you're wrong, or they wouldn't have the other 28. It's just the mind-numbingly large ego it takes for people to try to prove that their taste is objective just explodes my tiny brain. If it's something where they're arguing about something which is a real

 thing you can point at, but some people just don't care about. An example I gave in a previous video is, you could be playing a game that crashes a lot, but other than that, it's a really good game, it's got super cool mechanics, it looks cool, you're having so much fun playing it, but then someone will go, it's a bad game, it's an objectively bad game because it crashes a lot. And I've seen people go, I just save my game a lot, doesn't bother me when it crashes, I just reload and keep going, it's a super fun game. And they're like, no, it is objectively bad, crashes, measured, code, bad. I think they missed the entire point of what good and bad even is, and that it is very subjective. And I even imagine that there's gonna be comments for people, when you, no, it's not, right, you're wrong, taste is objective, crashing is objectively bad. You're missing the point, you are completely missing the point. Crashing is bad, that doesn't mean the game is bad for everyone. Don't know any other way to say that.

Related to that, I quickly learned from failure that you're only as good as your last game. So, going into Arcanum, we were on that high of Fallout, and then after Arcanum, when we had publishers come, they're like, well, you know, we're not really sure, Arcanum was doing that well, so we kind of, we did two immediate contracts, and we weren't exactly negotiating from a position of strength. After Temple went out, whoa, you know, it got some bad reviews, and I just slunk into Vampire, and even told the other two co-owners, Leonard and Jason, look, I'm just gonna do code, handle HR stuff, because I didn't want to touch design for a while. And that's happened throughout my career, that I used to just think it was really idiotic LinkedIn recruiters that contacted me through LinkedIn, that literally only looked at my last game and would go, oh, I have a great programming job for you, I have a great design job for you, and not realizing, you know, I do both, and I've done both for decades. Nope, they only looked up the last thing you did. People often do that just in general. So I'm only as good as whatever my last game was that I did, so if my last game wasn't good, in their mind, see previous point about subjective taste being subjective, I must be on a decline, or I must be on an incline, or I must have lost it, or just a billion things.

Which actually gets me into my next point, which is the right people on the team can make all the difference. You know, I've worked on teams where there's different levels of ability and passion, and buy-in on the team vision from different groups that are in the team, and you can kind of see it reflected in the end state of the game. When people really care, like, oh my God, they took ownership of some part of the game, you can tell, because that game just, that part of the game just feels really cool and really cared for in a way that's hard to put your finger on, but you're just like, I love this, whether it's dialogue, level layout, lighting, how characters walk and animate, it's everybody has a different thing that they like, and that's reflected in the game. And because I make games with different teams, many of the games I make vary in different ways, like some people said, well, I really like the mechanics in this one but not a later one, I really like the animations in this one but not the later one, how, how, how did it go backwards or whatever, and I'm like, it didn't, it just was done, made by different people who cared about different things. And again, because taste is subjective, they liked how that was, people thought this was a better way of doing things, and some people agree with them.

Which goes me to my next point, which is related to the previous one, is this took me a long time to learn, and I first noticed it at Interplay, and then it got reinforced every game company after that. I did not know this at my first company, Pegasus, that no matter what you do, literally no matter what you do, how you act, how good your work is, some people are going to like you and some people aren't. Often, this has less to do with you than it does with them. Either there's some character or personality trait you have that they just hate, and everybody who has that, or something you did set them off, and they can never see past that point. See my video on nuance and how you view people. It's hard to tell why people do the things they do, which is why I try to avoid talking about why anyone does anything they do. I just talk about what they did. But I have learned that there are some people I'm never going to win over, and other people are going to love me no matter what I do. And they're at the endpoints of a continuum, with a lot of people in the middle. And you just have to accept that, that you're not going to win some people over, and some people, you're never going to lose.

Which brings me the last point of what failure taught me, and I will say right here, I didn't learn this lesson until Leonard Boyarsky crystallized it by telling me this phrase. He said, "Hey, Tim, everyone is the hero in their own stories." Once he told me that, I looked back at how people talked about events in different games I made, and yeah, you know, that sometimes they talked up themselves, and I thought, that's what was happening, they're like, well, the game is really good, and they want to make their contribution seem important. But then I realized that just when people talk about themselves, they're always the good guy. They're always the one who tried to do the right thing, they never flew off the handle, they never said a bad thing, they never intentionally tried to hurt anyone. Yet, those things happened. And when Leonard told me that, I thought, oh, yeah, everybody does that. I do that. I, when something happens, I don't try to think of myself as being the bad guy, even though I want to tell you about some of the arguments that we got into at Troika, in a later video. I know I do that a lot, sorry, I just can't talk about everything in one video. Every time I look back on and like, I'm not proud of that. I think I might have even been on the wrong side of that, or at the very minimum, I just didn't need to care about what we were arguing about as much as I did. I should have just let it go and go, you know what, honestly, I don't really care, let's just do what you want to do. I don't, I don't care. It's not the part of the game I'm throwing my passion into. I shouldn't say I don't care, there

's never been a game I've made where I didn't care, just, I threw my passion into different places.

So I try to combat that tendency now that I'm aware of it, and I know that everybody wants to tell a story and make themselves a hero. I try to combat that in several ways. First of all, I've got all my notes, and taking notes since Interplay. I don't have much notes from Pegasus. I have a lot of notes from graduate school that you wouldn't care about. But ever since Interplay, I've been taking a lot of notes on things. I use those notes to try to ground me. When I do look up things in my notes, I try to ignore if I wrote down the why someone did something, I just care about the what. So when I report events, and when I talk about things here, especially if I talk about someone else, I say what they did, I try to say why they did it, I don't try to guess their mental state or what previous events led them to do that. I just say, this person did this. That's kind of the pros and cons of that is the pro is you can't argue that they didn't do it, the con is I do avoid trying to dive into anything that makes them, it make it more personable for them, because I feel like I can't, now that I understand this bias going on, I don't want to make them into a villain. Similarly, I'm not prepared to make them into a hero, so I just try to say, this person did this.

Similarly, I try to take blame for the things that I did wrong, and I've done that in multiple videos where I said, I did this wrong. And I notice, and get suspect, when I'm talking to someone who never seems to have done anything wrong. They're, they have this blameless career, like, they worked on a game, but all the basketball, that game, but that wasn't them. So that's something I really, I listen to that now, especially when people do interviews. I'm like, does this person ever do anything bad? They're always on the, they always made the right decision, they always pulled things out, that was amazing, everything they did. And then the final thing I've been doing, and I've learned to do this, I didn't want this to turn into a chat channel, but I've noticed that when I bring people on, like I've had Leonard on twice, and I brought JT on last week, it kind of keeps things real and keeps things grounded and gives me that other perspective into the same event. Because like I said, Leonard and I left a meeting once, and so the meeting had literally just happened, and we both had a different interpretation of what someone had meant when they said something, like, what, you know, I thought they were mad and throwing something out, and I was like, no, I didn't get that at all. So having people on to talk about things, especially a long time ago, in, you know, Fallout was 20, 28 years ago, well, and it started development almost 30 years ago, so having other people on here to talk about that is really important because I want that other perspective, even if I don't agree with it. I'm glad to hear it, because I've come to realize, hey, even with notes, everything I'm saying may not be the perspective that most people had on those events.

So, how do I wrap this up? I started this off by saying I learned way more about how to make good games from my failures than my successes, and I think the general rule here is when you do something right, you don't always know why it's right, but when you do something wrong, you get a much better idea of how to do it right. And I think that's true for a lot of things. For me, it was certainly true about making games, both design and code. So, I hope some of those lessons are things you guys can learn a little easier than how I did.

Lets Talk About Ideas.md
Youtube Link:
https://youtu.be/HqCe8tS47jg?si=6iYyzonZt4tfseA2

Hi everyone, it's me Tim, and today I want to talk to you about ideas. I've mentioned that I have notebooks full of ideas. There's one right here on my desk right now. There's a whole like half a dozen of them up on this bookshelf. They are filled to the brim with ideas, some of them are ideas that I fleshed out over several pages, some are just literally a sentence, "Hey, wouldn't it be cool if a game feature did XYZ?"

I still have people in comments and direct messages offering me their ideas. In some cases, they've even put together a little demo or they have a script or something, and they want me to review them. And I'm always turning it down, and I will tell you why. It's a dangerous thing to do. Most companies have a rule that they're not allowed to have anyone at the company look at unsolicited submissions. Movie companies don't look at scripts, game companies don't look at development ideas or demos or anything, because they might already have something in the works that's similar, and then they might be opening themselves up to a lawsuit that they've stolen someone's idea.

Now, I've told you how many books I've got that are page after page after page of idea. I guarantee if a hundred of you sent me a game idea, I probably match up on at least one of you, and probably a lot more than one. So it's super dangerous to look at someone's idea. But I want to kind of talk about more than that. I want to talk about more than me not looking at them.

First of all, just let me state this just outright. I think it's very sweet that people are sending me things, and I know you would love me to look at it. But there's also this weird attitude that comes with just a tiny fraction of a few of you. Some people are acting like their idea was the really hard part, like just having the idea was most of the heavy lifting. Or a second attitude I'm encountering is people go, "Here's an idea I had. You should be really grateful I'm allowing you to hear it," as if I should be thanking them for allowing me to see their idea.

Whoa. Let me just say that, like over the years, I could go to lunch with other game developers, and in that hour, I would hear a dozen good ideas. They would talk about the games we're making and other games and games they've played, and then game ideas they've had on their own. And ideas are not the hard part. And I've said this before, so I'm going to say it really loud and clear right now. Ideas are a dime a dozen. Ideas are the easy part. Ideas on their own are so cheap that they are nearly worthless. Worthless. I feel bad saying it that way because I know some people are going to get really irate that I'm saying this, or their feelings are going to get hurt, but I feel like some people aren't hearing this. And I tried to be really circumspect about it, but I feel like it's just not coming through. So again, ideas are nearly worthless.

So let me tell you a quick story about a dog I had, and I've shown a picture of him before. It's the dog I had during Troa and at Carbine. His name was Cutter. He came from the animal shelter. He had been there for 6 months, and he'd been on the street for six months. He was a German Shepherd. He was very smart, but he was very sensitive. And I learned very quickly when I was trying to train him that he already was well trained. He knew a lot of stuff, and he was very easy to train, so I could be very gentle with him. But when we were on walks, it sometimes like he wouldn't listen to me. I tell him to stop, and he'd keep going. I'd tell him to sit, and he wouldn't. So I'd have to, I almost said bark, I'd have to yell the command to him, and then he would duck his head and be like, "Oh." And that's when I realized he was also very sensitive. So if I ever raised my voice to him, if I ever got angry, he would get very, very upset. He would hang his head, he would mope, he would walk really quietly around the office or back at the house because he knew he had upset me. But what had happened was I told him to do something, and he didn't listen, he didn't do it, so I had to yell at him. And then suddenly he's like, "Oh my God, you're yelling at me."

There are people that I've worked with who are like this. They give you an idea, and you respond like, "Well, that's a really good idea, but we don't have room for it in this game," or "We don't have time to add anything more," or "That's a really good idea, but it doesn't fit with this game because of XYZ. Wanted to hold on to it, and maybe we'll try to do it in another game." These gentle remarks go completely unheeded, and the next day they're asking about their idea again, or they bring it up in a team meeting, "Well, I still think we should do this." Finally, I have to be super direct with them. "We're not doing it. It's not going in the game. You need to stop bringing it up." And then they get all upset. They're really hurt. They're like, "You were brutal to me." Sometimes they've complained, and I've had to go to my boss and go, "I've literally talked to this person five times about this idea. I've explained why it doesn't fit in the game. I explain why we don't have time to do it. I explained why the existing feature connects to other features better." They don't hear it. They, I thought first they didn't agree with me, and they were just going to go, "Okay, I'm going to keep saying this idea," but they literally didn't hear me. They would bring up the same idea and say how great it was, and I'm like, "But it doesn't work." Well, they be like, "I mean, like you've had weeks to think about this. You should have a response that's better than that."

And my point here is having to be brutal with someone to get them to hear you is an awful thing to have to do as a manager, and sometimes you have to do it. And I will tell you that of all the different types of people I've worked with, people who lie, people who are lazy, you know, people who are just trying to do the bare minimum of what they want to do and skate by, these people who don't hear you until you are brutally direct are probably some of the most annoying people that I've had to work with because they force you to be unkind and then blame you for it. It's, it's, you can keep saying, you can keep saying your gentle responses, and it doesn't sink in. And it is a frustrating way of working.

And I don't want to move this, by the way. Don't even read

 into this. This is not an introvert-extrovert thing. This is not an old person-young person thing. This is not a manager-employee thing. I've seen this in all directions. I've, I've been the youngest developer in the room, and I've been the oldest developer in the room. I've been the employee, the employer. I've seen this for 40 years. It's not new. It's not going away.

Now, let me, I don't, I don't like being non-constructive, so let me talk about what I think you should do. So let's say you have an idea that you want to send me, or you want to send a game company, you just, you're trying to send someone this. I've said this before. I will say it again. Make a prototype. This applies so much to ideas because ideas are just, they're easy to have. They're a dime a dozen. I have 12 good ideas before breakfast. I should say, have 12 ideas before breakfast. One sometimes is good. What you need to do is you need to figure out a way of expressing your idea as a realized feature. So if you're a system designer, write it down as you're doing a system design doc. Write all the elements of this feature, fill in the numbers. If it has parameters, don't just say it, you know, the bullets, this one does a lot of damage. Say, "Well, I'm expecting a creature to have 200 hit points, and this does 30 to 40 hit points per shot." Make a full dialogue. If you're a narrative designer, write a full dialogue. Write several dialogues. Put in checks against attributes and skills that you've said, "Okay, this, I'm going to assume these exist in the game," and here, look at how reactive my dialogue is. Do checks against existing quests, say, "I'm assuming a main story arc that goes like this, and I'm going to check this is how this NPC would react to different parts along that story arc."

If you're an artist, make some shippable quality art. Maybe it's concept art. Maybe you did it 2D. Maybe you did it in 3D Studio. Maybe you made, you know, a model. Maybe you showed how you rigged the skeleton. But do that. Make something. Don't just talk about it, especially if you can take an engine, do, un, Unreal, and make a working demo of the feature. So if you can make a version of the dialogue that you can actually play through, doesn't matter that there's not a game there, that you start the demo starts and you're already talking to somebody, and you just talk back and forth. If you can show your gun in action, if you can show a section of a world and say, "This is what I'm envisioning this thing to look like," that just goes so far to showing your idea as an expressed idea, idea, and not just something you thought of.

And I will tell you why this is important. If you don't do any of those things, if you just want to have an idea that you tell someone, if you can't do that work, why should they? If you can't do this work, and I've said this is, I've lost track of how many times I've said, "Make a demo." If you're not going to do that, why should I even look at your idea? And that sounds harsh, but there's a lot of you who aren't hearing me say this.

So no, I don't really want to go over your ideas. And because I'm still working in the industry, I can't actually look at your demos or anything because it may be very similar to something I'm doing for a client, and I'm not going to open them up for legal action. Because if I'm already working on something, say that has flying zombies that shoot lasers out of their eyes, and you sent me this great idea, "I said I want to do something like Walking Dead, but the zombies can fly and shoot lasers," and I'm like, "Uh-oh, that we're already doing something like that." It may be so obscure like that that you may think, "Tim stole my idea and gave it to this other company." So for that reason alone, and right now because I'm working for two or three clients, I literally can't look at submitted work because I'm not opening them up to legal action, thinking that the ideas I'm telling them to go with might have come from something that someone gave me.

So I have a legal reason not to look at your stuff, but I'm trying to tell you what the reason is companies and other game devs and stuff don't want to see your stuff. When you finally apply for a job and have a resume, please don't just say, "And here's a list of ideas I have." If you can show them a realized expression of the idea, you're way ahead of things. So that's as brutal and as direct and as forward as I think I can get. So I hope you get the point of this video, which is, I can't look at your ideas or your demos. And when you submit them to companies, do it as part of your applying for a job. Don't just say, "Hey guys, I think you should make this game," because they're probably not going to look at it, and they're probably going to send it back unopened.

Anyway, I hope this was a positive spin on this concept. It's as positive as I can make it, but I hope people hear me. Thank you.

Level Caps.md
Youtube Link:
https://youtu.be/CwqqIjdQoqU?si=QNXQux9WIK5GHOAV

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim. Today I want to talk about level caps, and this is a question from my industry buddy, Matt Pritchard, and he basically wanted me to talk about level caps versus having infinite advancement in an RPG. Now, if you've played any of my games, you'll know that I always seem to go level cap, and mainly it's because I've always pushed as one of the design pillars, even if it isn't expressly stated in some of my games, that I want the player to have a lot of opportunity to have replayability in my game, to make new characters and experience new content and do different things, basically play differently and see how that works out. The problem I've always had with infinite advancement is you will eventually get all your skills to Max, you get all the perks that are in the game, you'll see all the content or, I suppose, I should caveat that you're going to see most content, um, if there was say dumb dialogue and your character didn't start with a low int, and dumb dialogue wasn't triggered by having a negative status effect on your int, uh then you're not going to see that dialogue. Also, a lot of my RPGs have decision-based content like you may decide to join one faction and not another, so even though you can do content in both of those factions, eventually you have to pick one, and then you're not going to see the later game content of the other factions. You may also choose to play in a certain way that causes some content to unlock and other content to be locked, so yes, I agree that infinite advancement doesn't necessarily mean you will see all the content, but sometimes I think it means that you see more content that I expected you to see on one playthrough. 

The other issue I've always had with infinite advancement is I like when you play just the regular person, especially when the story supports out by like, oh, you just happened to pull the short straw so you're leaving the Vault, or, you know, Phineas was in a rush and he just pressed the button and grabbed one of the cryosleeping units at random. I like that you're a regular person who's thrust into this story, and I think that the system mechanics, and I've said this a lot, mechanics should support story should support that. When you have infinite level caps, at some point in the game, you become like a walking God, and you're just mowing things down, wrecking stuff that should be giving you some kind of challenge, and I do like going back and being able to wreck stuff that you've encountered, but like, I like the fact that in Fallout 1, deathclaws were always scary. You could be in power armor and have a minigun; you're still going to pause when you see a deathclaw walk on the screen. If you see multiple deathclaws walk on the screen, you're going to do more than pause; you're probably going to run away, but I like that. I like that the world remains scary in places and challenging or whatever adjective you want to use. 

Now, because I always like to talk about pros and cons, I scratched my head for a long time thinking of the downside of level caps, which is basically the overreaching downside is it stops your advancement, which is antithetical to a lot of my statements of, let's play how you want. So probably the thing people complain about the most about level caps is they hit it before they hit the end of the game, so then they feel like, well, I'm playing, but I'm not getting XP anymore, or if I do get XP, it doesn't matter, and there's still more of the game to experience, but some of the reward has gone out of it. The reward loop has been cut to basically finding good items and finding crafting ingredients and things like that. But also, if you hit your level cap before you, you made the character you may have a concept of a character, and you started playing the game without realizing that because of the level cap, you're never going to get that many points in those skills and those perks that you'll need to support your character conception, and I get that, and that is a big downside of a level cap. 

The other complaint I've heard, and I agree with this one too, is people often complain that by the time they get a new perk or they've maxed out a skill, and they want to run around and see how that is like, they're at the end of the game. Fallout 1 suffered a great deal in that there were several perks that literally had a level requirement of 18, and since the level cap was 20, it pretty much said if you're going to play like one of them was the Slayer, the unarmed attack perk that let you just sometimes hit someone and kill them, that was level 18, you got at most two levels of play out of that, and then you were level capped. So I get, I get that, and I agree that those are some pretty significant restrictions, and they fly in the face of some of my well-used design pillars of play how you want, make the character you want. 

Also, unlimited advancement has some pros. I will admit that when I was thinking about it, I was like okay, there are some things here that I agree with. The biggest one is if you have a game with procedural generation and level scaling, it's fun to have unlimited advancement because you can see just how crazy some of those encounters get. I mean, it's really fun to go into a new place that's generated and populated with monsters, and you see what happens when their level goes up, you start to see monsters with new names or subtitles, you start to see new abilities you didn't see earlier in the game, items start to drop, you know, if you're playing a game that goes, you know, rare, epic, legendary, whatever. I hate the ones that are all color-based, you know, and people go like, oh, did you get that purple drop? I'm like, I have no idea, but I get the excitement of going up to a really high level just to see how the game reacts to that. I mean, and that fits right into my reactivity pillar. Interestingly, though, from the same camp of people who hate level caps and really want unlimited advancement, those are often the first people who complain about level scaling, which if you don't have that, you go back to my big complaint that unlimited advancement means you're walking god with nothing to challenge you, and I've said elsewhere, I kind of like level scaling if it's constrained in a certain way, and the constraint is once I encounter something, I don't expect it to level scale when I encounter it again. So if I go and I see a boss and I run away, I expect him to be the same level when I come back. Also, there are some random encounters that I expect to have a level cap. When you start running into bandits that are like, I'm going to steal your pouch of 100 gold, and they're wearing armor that's worth 10,000 gold, I'm like, why aren't you retiring? Why aren't you buying a house in the south of this country and just retiring? You're a

 very wealthy bandit. 

So infinite levels have that downside of turning your game into the kind of game that you didn't anticipate when you envisioned the setting and the story because now you have some just uber powerful things running around to be able to challenge your uber powerful player characters, but you didn't plan on having a game where godlike creatures roam the Earth just so that when the player encounters them, they're not killed in one shot. So yeah, I see that a lot. So I guess to wind this up, I've given a lot of pros and cons of both level caps and unlimited level scaling. I even can say that I see the appeal of people who want unlimited leveling. I get it, but as I'm frequently asked, hey, if you were given a new project and a big bag of money, and you can do whatever you want, what would you pick? And I'll answer that the way I've answered that a lot before. I've had that opportunity frequently, and every single time, I pick level cap. I have level caps in Fallout, I had level caps. I'm pretty sure I had a level cap in Arcanum. I know I had a level cap in Temple, and we had a level cap in Outer Worlds. I just think that the pros of level cap outweigh the pros of unlimited leveling, even though unlimited leveling does support some of my pillars. I think level caps support more of them, so given a choice, you're going to see level caps in my game, but I get those of you who want unlimited leveling, and that's the best answer I think I can make for this question. Good question, though.

Hi everyone, it's me Tim, and today I want to talk about level scaling. I've had a lot of questions about level scaling, especially after I did some of the videos on Random Encounters and how I did it in both Fallout and Arcanum. So, I thought I'd talk about level scaling and how my ideas on it changed over time. But let me go ahead and give one of the questions that many, many people asked. This one is from Angel vodka 2984 who asks:

"What do you think about level scaling? Do you like the game world and enemies to scale up to your character's level so you get more or less constant challenge, or do you prefer a fixed level system in which some areas get easier over time but you get a more real sense of progression?"

It's a good question, covers all the bases that I want to go over. So, for those of you who just want to TL;DR, I tend to prefer fixed, but lately, I've been really into a very limited form of level scaling. So let me break that down now.

So I used to always make fixed level, no scale systems. Fallout was like that. The idea was if you found an area that was too hard, you should leave, gain some levels, and come back. So everything that we put down in the world was a fixed level. So if you went up to the military base, that was really hard. If you went around the Shady Sands area, that was really easy. If you went up a lot of levels, you'd find the Shady Sands area trivial, and you would start to become, it' become tougher and tougher, or easier and easier for you to go up to the northwest where the really hard stuff was. This also sort of is how Random Encounters worked. We did have tougher Random Encounters up in certain areas, especially the Northwest, than in others. In general, though, Random Encounters were all over the place, and the special Random Encounters that you got that luck factored into, there was no particular level you had to be.

However, when Arcanum was being designed, I did introduce level scaling of A Sort. I'll describe what I did; you can decide whether it was level scaling. So Arcanum Random Encounters, and I explained this in, there's a whole video explaining this, had a power level that the designer set, so that was fixed. However, Arcanum could also give you different Random Encounters based on whether it was day or night. So some designers made some areas harder at night than they were during the day, and a few were vice versa. So while this isn't really a form of level scaling, you can think of it as, hey, if you want to Adventure here, you have to plan it so you arrive during the day because things went really hard at night. EverQuest did this. There was a forest, Kithicor, which was not bad, not too easy to run through during the day, but you did not want to go there at night. It really awful Undead spawned at night. There were a few areas in Arcanum that were like that.

However, we did have aent that were triggered by quests that did affect the random encounter system. For example, um, the Maloian Hand, the Assassins that were sent out for you, were triggered when you got the main story state to a particular point. Now, because we knew that those wouldn't be done early in the game, we made those encounters really tough. And because those are triggered by the quest and not your location, they can happen anywhere, which means you could be in an area that had really low power Random Encounters and run into the Moc hand. So that was kind of a form of level scaling in the sense that we knew you were higher level and had gotten to a certain part of the storyline and had triggered it. Some Locan hands were inserted into the random encounter tables at that point. That was about as much level scaling I think as we did in Arcanum.

When I did Temple, I went right back to fixed levels for all the encounters, and that was for two reasons. One, it's kind of what I like doing, and two, that's what the module called for. The module was designed so that the areas around Homlet were pretty easy. N was a little harder. The abandon Bandit keep, you were supposed to go there early, but the lower levels in the Bandit keep were a little harder, and then the temple was designed to be harder the deeper you went down. So that when you got down to the very lowest levels and the elemental planes, those were supposed to be really hard. So we kind of stuck to that. I don't think there was anything in Temple that checked your level and changed any encounters that you might have.

However, when I did the Outer Worlds, I wanted to do a form of level scaling. I consider it limited level scaling. What I wanted was I wanted people to be challenged, but I didn't want them to lose the feeling of progression because that's what I love. I love you encounter something, and it's too hard, and you go and level up and come back and kick its butt. I like that. I didn't like when you came back and it had leveled up too. I know that might be realistic, but it it makes you lose that feeling of of progression. So what we did on Outer Worlds was any encounter, any creature encounter with place down, had a range from X to Y. Now let's say you were level n, and you showed up, well, if your level n was less than x, which was their lower level, they were still Level X. Basically, there was a lower level to which they would not drop low. So if you encountered them, they were level X, that was going to be too hard for you because you, you, you were lower level, you'd have to come back. If, if you encountered some a group, and your level n was between X and Y, then their level would be set to n. So they were challenge for you, they were, they were set to your level, and you could fight. If when you encountered them, your level n was greater than Y, which was the maximum in their range X to Y, then they were just set to Y. You would basically gotten powerful enough, they weren't going to get any more powerful, and you could take them on, and they'd probably be a pretty easy encounter, especially as your level went higher and higher.

Now, one thing to say about that is, well, two things really. One, once you encountered a particular group of creatures, their level was fixed. So let's say, let's say that X to Y was 5 to 10, and you were level three, you encounter them, well, your three is less than five, so they were set to level five. Maybe you fought them, and they were too hard, and you left. If you came back at level six, they would not be level six, they had already been spawned in, they were still level five, so you saw them as level five, you came back, they were level five, you fought them. If you had never encountered them before, though, and you walked into that level when you were first level

 six, they'd be level six. So this is the way we kind of said, okay, there's going to be challenge, but once you encounter something, it got pinned, so you could felt you feel like you could progress and take them on. Also, those minimum and maximum X and Y got higher in later zones, but we did that so that those, those higher level zones were designed to be more challenging. So if you, if you got in your rocket, your, your uh, what was your ship's name, the, the inconvenient, I forget what the ship name was in our worlds, oh, the Unreliable, I even Nam that. If you took the Unreliable straight to Monarch and landed on the one pad that you could land on without clearance, then you would discover very quickly that you were probably in over your head. Those were set to a really high level. But the advantage of going there and touching down, at least going out and looking, was it pinned them to the lowest level in their range. So then when you came back, they were already pinned. That range, I believe, there were a bunch of radons that were running around inside the town, the abandoned town, that had that landing pad on it. If you had never gone to Monarch and you decided to check out that Landing Pad later, they might be a lot, a lot higher. And I like that because it, it gave you some sort of reward for at least exploring zones that were a little too high for you, knowing that you could come back later and they were pinned to that lower level. And I also liked that giving that range meant the level designers could designed progressively harder and harder zones by dropping some similar encounter in terms of these were the same creatures, but I was moving them up to higher levels so they had more hit points, they may have gained extra um attacks. They would also mix more things in. Early encounters tended to be homogeneous, and the later ones was here's a mix of different kinds of rapad, Don, you know, the spitters, the Chargers, and then their level was also higher. I think that is what I ended up liking. If I was going to do a game from now on, I think I like that form of limited level scaling, and I'm calling it limited because there are games out there, I know, you know which ones I'm talking about, that the level scaling is done to your level dynamically whenever you have the encounter. So you're walking down the street, you know, a Raider attacks you, you're level five, he's level five, you run away, you go up 10 levels, you come back at level 15, and you think you're going to kick that Raider's ass, no, he's now level 15 too. So I didn't like that because one, it robbed you of any sense of progression, and two, when the ra, when a, if a Raider has moved up to level 15, you wonder why they're still raiding. They have so much money and such good equipment, you're like, you could, you could sell one of those guns and retire.

So what I settled on was a form of limited level scaling. That's what I like. It's got challenge, it's got the sense of progression, it still gives level designers a means of making levels and and indicating these are progress, these should be progressively harder, within a range, seems to work all around. Let me know what you think of it, that was I thought the best solution. But be sure to tell me I'm wrong. Anyway, Angel vodka, that's my thoughts on level scaling.

Loading And Saving

Youtube Link:
https://youtu.be/S_gE99yeK6c?si=SbvAJE5Bt6KXvsef

Hi everyone, it's me Tim. Today I want to talk about loading and saving games. I've gotten a lot of questions about this, so I'm going to answer it, but I want you to know this is a very high level answer. I think some people are literally asking me how to load and save their game, which I cannot answer because one, it's highly dependent on what language you're writing in, what engine you're using, even if it's your own, and what decisions you've made about how you want load and save to work.

So instead, I'm going to describe a lot of the high level stuff, including the decisions you have to make before you even write a line of code. If you want to know the low-level stuff, look up serialization for whatever your language and engine is. There should be a lot of tutorials on how to do serialization. That's what you want.

So let's talk first about what kinds of save game systems there are and kind of the pros and cons for those. So the first one, and the one I've liked using a lot, is you can save anywhere, anytime. These are the hardest ones to write because you have to save the state of many, many things, and sometimes things that it's hard for you to get the state for. For example, if you can save anywhere in an RPG, can you save when a character is in the middle of an animation? Maybe he's being knocked back, and you hit save. Maybe they're falling, and you hit save. Maybe they're in the middle of casting a spell, which has an animation, and they're surrounded by particle effects, and there's AI that is reacting to it, save. So these are the hardest ones to write because literally every system in your game will be required to be able to load and save its State, and many of those will be systems maybe you didn't write, maybe you brought down a third-party physics engine, but you want to load and save everywhere, so you need to know how to interrogate that physics engine and say where is this character located, what state are they in, what you know what's what are every detail about that state I would need so I can recreate it in your engine. By the way, some of them don't provide that, so you won't be saving during a fall because the physics engine doesn't give you either all the ability to read the state or more common doesn't give you all the ability to set the state. So sometimes, depending on choices that have been made that have nothing to do with load and save, you are now restricted to what kind of load and save you're going to do.

**Restrictions**

Probably a more common load save system will be you can save in some places and at sometimes but not everywhere anytime. Examples of restrictions like that I've seen are you can save whenever the game isn't in combat. That's a common one that avoids a lot of State variables that only have to do with combat, especially in AI um where you have NPCs deciding what they're doing moment to moment as opposed to their very high level AI, which is I was walking here, or I was going to stop and look around. I've also seen games where you can only save when you're back in town, so that not only presupposes you're not in combat but also you can only save in certain locations in the world that probably don't have a lot of State change, especially if you're not allowed to fight in town, or the NPCs are marked as essential there. Saving back in town really restricts a lot more of what the save game has to understand how to save the state for. And then there are other ones that say you can only save when you go to rest, so when your character rests or camps or sleeps or whatever your game calls it, you're also given the option, do you want to save at this point? This is a really restrictive way of doing it, but if you think about it, it guarantees you won't be in the middle of a dialogue, you won't be casting a spell, nobody's in the middle of falling, so you can literally ignore and not have to interrogate or reset your physics engine, your animation system, your particle effect system. There's just a bunch of systems that won't ever need to know about load and save.

**Checkpoints**

These are real common in consoles, you have checkpoints where the game automatically saves when you reach a certain spot. It can be a physical location, it could be the end of a story act or something like that. Checkpoints make it really easy because you're defining exactly when and where a save can even happen, and there is even more modules then that will never need to know anything about save because it's known that you can only save at this particular spot. So not all story variables, basically just it's the end of the ACT, what story variables will carry over to next Acts or into end slides, all the rest you can throw away.

Now a subset of checkpoints are Autosaves, so you may have a game that lets you save anywhere or save in a lot of places, but it also has an autosave system, especially like you're going to talk to a boss or maybe when you transition Maps, it Autos saves. Auto saves are kind of like checkpoints in the sense of usually less can be saved, but they're more of a way of making sure that the player doesn't end up in a bad state if the map transition messes up or they die when they encounter the boss.

**Quick saves**

And then related to Autosaves are quick saves. Quick saves are when the player says I want to make a save and hit a button, and it's legal to do so because you can even have quick save systems and systems where you can't save everywhere, and then the quick save would just go, can't save here. But if you can, quick saves are just go ahead and make a save. I don't want to go through UI, I don't want to answer any questions, just make a save. This is important for the next stage of what you have to think about for load and saves, which are UI choices.

Several UI choices you have to make for save games are how many slots can you have. Is it an infinite number of slots, or by infinite, I mean until you run out of hard disk space or Cloud save space, or wherever your save games are being stored, or is it a predefined limited number of save slots. This can be different for the different kinds of saves. Maybe you're when you the player chooses to save and goes through the UI, they can have as many as their memory will allow, but maybe Autosaves and quick saves are limited to maybe a rolling list of three, so every time you hit quick save, it saves one, and then saves two, and then saves three. If you quick saved again, it would right over quick save one. A lot of games do that. They kind of have to because they're not going to bring up UI to ask you any questions, so the quick save has to have some way of knowing where to save.

There are other things such as do you get to name the save game, do you get to type something in like just entered the Dungeon of Doom or first time at RiverTown. Those are great. A lot of games though do autogenerated save game names with things like here's your the map location

 and the sublocation you are in and maybe a date stamp. Well, for auto saves and quick saves that don't bring up a UI, you kind of have to have those, so a lot of people just decide let's just do them for all of them to make them consistent.

And then finally, you have to decide whether or not your save game is going to have an image associated with it. We didn't used to do that because that was very expensive, usually the image was bigger than the save game size. In the modern era, taking a screenshot, slapping it up as part of the save game is easy, and it also makes it easy for you to figure out what save game is which, even if you have multiple save games in the same dungeon on the same level, and you weren't very careful what the name or the autogenerated names are just a Tim stamp, you can look at that image and go oh I remember what I was doing. So those are UI decisions you have to make.

Now let's talk about the save code, load and save code itself. Again, I'm not going to show you how to serialize, you need to look that up for your specific engine and language, but I will tell you like first I'll tell you what I do, and then decisions you're going to have to make yourself.

So in general, what I tend to do for load save is for every module if I was doing it in C or every class if I was doing it in C++ or C, I would write a load method and a save method that understands how to load and save that module War class's particular data. I'm just going to say class from now on. It's a collection of thing of relevant things. So what tends to happen with this method is it's past a file pointer, and if you're saving, then you write out your data at that with that file pointer and return. If you're loading, then you load in your data from that file pointer and you return.

Now some decisions you have to make if you're going to do this is well, there's several. First of all, is that file pointer at the right spot? In other words, has the parent passed into you the file pointer aimed at your section of data? If yes, then you can do this, and it's usually a really fast way of doing it because you can just grab that file pointer, load your data, return, but it requires you to follow a very specific rule of it better be at the right spot, and when you're done, you better have left it at the correct spot past you. If you don't do that, that because nobody besides you knows what the data should be, bugs will propagate. So if you read in the data but don't leave it at the very next section after yours, the next load will fail because the file pointer is not pointing correctly. These are really hard to debug because a bug will show up in a save game not loading, and it will show up in load methods that aren't the one that has the problem. In fact, if you're lucky and it shows up in the very first load method that follows the one that messed up, you can easily go, oh, this load method isn't pointing at the right section. It must be the previous guy's fault, but they're trust me they're hard to find.

If you say no, if you decide no, I will have each method reposition the pointer, that solves that problem of propagating errors because it makes it very self-contained. It also makes it easy to add new sections. If you add a new module, a new class, and it needs to write out its data, it can just put it in there, and then it finds its correct section when it's past the file pointer. However, this method is always slower than assuming the file pointer is in the right place because you are literally calling out to your save device, whether it's hard drive or cloud, and having it move that file pointer, having it search through your data for something. Whether you know how many bytes in it is, you if there's an index somewhere, you have to look up in the index, you're going to do extra work, and it will slow down your load and save process. Maybe that doesn't matter. Maybe your load save process is so nearly fast that you don't have to worry about it, but I've worked on games where it's really slowed it down a lot.

The next decision you have to make is do you save out the data as raw data, meaning if you have an INT, do you just write out, you know, the four bytes that are in your int with an fwrite, and then you fread in that int, you know, from your load say if you were doing it in C. This saving it with raw data makes it super fast and gives you the smallest possible save file you're going to get, but you will need to learn how to serialize everything by hand. You will have to know how to serialize not only your base data, ins, floats, doubles, but you're going to have to figure out how to handle pointers because if you have an array of pointers to items, you're going to have to save those items and then reconstruct that array of pointers during the load. So you're going to be doing memory allocation. You're going to be then setting pointers to the memory that you've allocated. You're going to have to do all this by hand. It's a lot of work, but it'll give you the fastest, smallest save files you ever have.

Now let's say you don't want to do that because like Json got really popular, basically string-based object saving. In fact, Json is human readable. The nice thing about this doing it that way is it is very easy to write code for it. Like if the sections have a string at the beginning saying here's combat code, and your combat module goes find that string that's like bracket combat code, you find it, you know you're in the right section, and then you can read in your variable. It's like hey, here comes an array of 10 objects. Here's the name of each object, you know, string. Here's the data on each object stored as a string. You know, here's the health value of them store. Strings make it very easy to read, very easy to write, but your save game will be very big and very slow. Again, if that size and speed isn't a concern to you, rock on. If it is, now it also has an impact, what decisions you just made, on versioning.

Versioning is when you have a save game either from a previous version of the game, like you put out a patch for your game, so now you have a 1.1. Can that 1.1 read 1.0 saves? Also, if you had a save that was made with a DLC, let's say you played your whole game, you bought a DLC, you kept playing, and you made a save with that DLC, can the base game, if you reinstall the base game without the DLC, can you load that save game? If a mod, if you support modding, if you play a modded game, can the base game load it? If you play a modded game, can, does it know what mod it is? So if it goes to

 load a modded game and that mod isn't on your game anymore, will it know that? Some games just fail. Some games detect that and say I can't read this, sorry. Some games detect that and go, I don't know how to read data for this mod or for this DLC, so I'm going to load the base game version of this save game. There's a whole bunch of decisions you have to make, and that's basically how you do versioning.

I will tell you if you went with the human-readable Json string-based, it's a lot easier to do versioning because if you get to a section you don't recognize, you can have a default like I don't know what this is, what section this is. My default is to not have an item like this, so if you recognize, if there's an item you don't recognize because it's only in the DLC, you simply don't have it anymore. It's not in your inventory. Harder to do that with the raw data. You can still do it. Also, it's something you need to keep in uh in mind for how you're going to handle when you patch your game. If a 1.1 generates a save game that 1.0 can't read, you need to decide is that something you can see in the UI when you look at it, that this is a save game for 1.1 and you're playing a 1.0 version. How does it display that? Is it, will it try to load it and fail, or will it actually display in the UI, this is an unloadable save game? To load it, you need to go to a newer version. Will it tell you what to do, or will it just mark it and like will it gray it out and say, I don't know how to load this? These are all decisions you have to make as part of your load save game data if you want to support versioning.

I told you this is really complicated, and I haven't even mentioned a line of code. I think that is most of what you need to think about. So to sum it up, think of how, what kind of save game system you want to support. Think about the UI choices you want to make for that save game system, and then when you're actually writing the code, think about how you want that code to work with data. Is it going to be raw data? Is it going to be serialized into a string or some other human-readable format? Those are things you need to think about for load saves. Good luck, it is a complicated thing to do, and I'm sure people are going to weigh in with far better ideas than I had here, but this is in general the way I did it and the scope of what I did. So, I hope that answers people's load save questions.

Hi everyone, it's me Tim, and today I want to talk about loot tables or my theory of loot tables. I'll talk about what a loot table is and then I'm going to talk about my theory and the literally hardcore design elements that go into deciding what items go on to loot tables. I'm going to bring up screenshot examples of what I mean. This is kind of intended to be an extension of what I talked about in the game economy video, so you may want to watch that.

This is, uh, I realized when I was talking about how I decide what items end up on what loot tables, I described it at a very high level. I kind of want to go into that in more detail. So first, let's talk about what a loot table is. A loot table is a list of items that get put on a creature, either when it spawns or when it's killed. I usually do it in my games when they spawn because you can often pickpocket them. A lot of games that don't have that just put it on the spawn. I mean, sorry, put it on the when they're killed. They generate loot into their body, which gets converted into a container when it dies.

There's a lot of ways of actually implementing a loot table. I'll briefly mention a few here, but I really want to talk about how you decide what goes on the loot table. So some loot tables just are a list of items, and it says pick one to five of these at random. So when the thing, when it's ready to create the loot, it'll roll a random number from one to five. Let's say you pick three, and then it grabs three random things off the list, possibly allowing duplicates, possibly not, and that's what appears on the creature.

Another way to do it is the list of items all have a probability next to it, and you just walk down, and you roll. The probability, 20% chance of this, roll, got it. 30% chance of this, roll, didn't get it. And you just walk down the list, and that's how some items are rarer than others and some aren't. You can combine those and say I'll pick one to five things off the list of items that have probabilities. These are all great. They all have their own pros and cons. It really depends on what kind of game you're making.

What I want to talk about, though, is how I decide what items end up on that loot table, no matter how you implement the loot table. How do you decide what ends up on the loot table? And this is something that I've done informally for years, but when I was at Carbine, I had a really good designer I worked with, Andy Curtain, and he talked about this method, and I've picked this up, and I've refined it over the years, and this is what I've used in all my games going forward.

So let me show you the loot table spreadsheet I use. Bing, you can see this is a spreadsheet. It's a 2D spreadsheet. I'll talk in a minute about how you might have more dimensions than two, but this is a two-dimensional spreadsheet. The rows are player levels. I've picked here levels ranges of five, so 1 to 5, 6 to 10, 11 to 15. What that means is for a player within that level, this is the sources of different loot types, and I'll get to that.

Now, I picked a level range of five here. It's not arbitrary, but you can pick different numbers if you want. You can go down to smaller numbers. The risk is if you picked every player level, got a new row, then what's going to happen is the player is going to see basically new sources of items come in every time they level, and they're not really going to get a good feel for where the good items are coming from. So if you do it, if the range is too small, the sources vary too quickly. If you make the source, the range too big, the sources change too slowly, and it means that the player, if the player is waiting for a good type of item and doesn't do crafting, for example, they may have to wait a long time for that item before it changes to a new source.

Let's go look at the columns. The columns are by loot type. The columns I picked here are, and this is, it's very arbitrary, but it's, I picked armor by type, so there's helmets, chest armor, pants, gloves, and boots, and then just weapons, and then consumables. There's a whole bunch of ways you could've done that. I could have reduced armor to just armor and then expanded weapons to melee and range weapons or magical and non-magical weapons. Or maybe the melee was broken down to one-handed melee, two-handed melee, and ranged. In addition to consumable, there might have crafting materials. You might want to put junk on here. I didn't because I'm like, what is high-quality junk? It's junk. But you might want to have, hey, when really expensive junk drops, that's something I want to do as a potential loot source.

Then the entry of each one of these, what's in the cell, is a code, a two-letter code for the loot sources, and that you can see down on the bottom right. A loot source is what, the where in the world you would find that item. So SC means scene. It means it exists in the scene. You walk into a room, there it is, sitting on the floor or sitting on a shelf. It's somewhere you can just walk right up, you see it, and you can grab it directly from the world, as opposed to a container. A container could be a dead body with something already on it. It could be a chest. It could be a bookcase. I've seen games where bookcases are scenes, and I've seen games where bookcases are containers. You can do it either way.

Containers are interesting because some containers can be locked. That factors into what the player will need in terms of a skill and or items to get at that container. Then I have GD for generic drop. That's a drop off of just a unnamed generic monster, so like a wolf would be a generic drop, as opposed to ND, which is a name drop, which is usually a named NPC. There might have, you might have like Greyman, King of the Wolves. He's a very specific character in the game. He gets an ND, a name drop.

Another source of items are quests, QU. VE for vendors. CR for crafting. Now, just like what I mentioned with item types, you can expand these into different, you can make more of them if you want. For example, for quests, you might want to differentiate main quest from side quest. For vendors, you may want to have like village vendors versus city vendors. You may want specialized vendors like guild vendors, and you only want the source of the best items to come from those guys at a particular level range.

So let's throw all this together, and I'll talk about what these cells mean. So we have player level and loot type intersecting at a cell. What that means is that loot type of item, that item

 type in the game for that player level range, the best ones of those type drop in that from that loot source.

Let's take a look at this, levels 1 through 5. So the best helmets for level 1 to 5 say SC. That means the best helmets you find in the game are found in the scene. They may be in a dungeon lying on a floor. They may be in a room somewhere on the top of a piece of furniture, and you can just grab it. Maybe it's guarded, maybe it's not. Chest armor comes from containers, so you find them in chests and in a safe, possibly locked, possibly not.

The best pants at levels 1 through 5 come from generic drops, so you find those off of maybe a bandit. But the best gloves come from ND, which is name drops. So the best gloves at level 1 to 5 to find are from name drops. Might be the Bandit Leader, it might be the named guard in town, it might be the named Necromancer at the bottom of the dungeon, but that's where the best gloves come from.

The best boots, QU. Quest. So the best boots they could find at this level would come from a quest. They'd have to finish a quest to get the best boots. The best weapons, VE, come from vendors. That means they sell them for that level range. Now you may question, what does that mean for that level range? Well, you can do it multiple ways. You can say maybe it's a vendor you don't expect the player to reach until they're this level range. You might say that the vendor has the item, but it's priced to be only available to a player of that level range. So at level 1 to 5, it's very cheap. If a vendor was a source of a weapon at level 46 to 50, you might expect that weapon to be very, very expensive, so you don't expect a level one to be able to buy it. You can even go so far as say that they don't sell it until you're that level range. Maybe you can see it in their inventory, but they're like, no, that's not for you, or maybe it doesn't appear in their inventory until the player's that range. Their pros and cons are doing it both ways.

And then finally, the best consumables at level 1 to 5 say crafting, CR. That means that the player will have to get the ingredients and make their own consumable to get the best one at this level range. Now, when I say best, that doesn't mean like, like, let's talk about consumables. Maybe for healing, there are bandages that heal just a few hit points, and they do it as a hot, a heal over time, so they take a while to do it. Those can drop anywhere, but a heal potion at level 1 to 5, which heals you 1 to 10 hit points immediately, that can only be crafted. That's what this chart is saying, that the best at this level range come from these sources.

The advantage of doing it this way is every row, you want to mix it up so that from 6 to 10, you can see consumables, the best ones came from crafting, but level 6 to 10, the best ones come from scenes. The same way that vendors sold the best weapons from 1 to 5, at level 1 to 5, but crafting makes the best weapons from 6 to 10.

What's great about this is it means that if the players find a really good sword at a vendor when they first start, that sort of good and that sort will get them through many levels, but there start to see better swords later from quests, from name drops, so they're always getting a source of better weapons. If they don't use one of these particular channels, for example, let's say you decide to play a game and you don't want to craft. Well, what that means is at level 1 to 5, you're not going to get the best consumables. That means at level 6 to 10, you're not going to get the best weapon. That means at level 11 to 15, you're not going to get the best gloves. Now, will you survive? Yes, you can go a few levels without having the absolute best gloves in the game, but if you're the kind of player who wants the best every time, you're going to have to pick up crafting.

And you also see the advantage of crafting. This kind of loot distribution highlights the advantage of doing quests, of killing bosses, of crafting because at some point in the game, they will be the best source of something that you want.

Now, a couple of caveats with this method. In this particular one, I set it up so that the number of item types and the loot type columns equaled the number of sources in the game. You don't have to do that. They can be slightly unequal. Well, what does that mean? If you have more loot types than you have sources, that means some sources will be repeated on every row, meaning for every given player level, the best weapons may come from two different sources, or you just don't include a source on every row, which means maybe crafting isn't the best source of anything at a particular level range.

If you have more, um, uh, items, if you have more sources than you have item types, did I get that backwards? If you have more sources than you have item types, you're going to have to duplicate some sources on a row or not use them. If you have more item types than you have sources, then you're going to have to have m sources per row to handle all the item types, and you're not going to be able to avoid that. You're going to have, like, I don't have enough to, to go around.

In general, keeping them equal is helpful. If they're slightly off by one or two, it's not that bad. It basically means the player will either go a level range where he sees multiple sources for an item type, or he goes a level range where a particular source isn't, doesn't generate an it, the best item type. Both of those are okay, but if the difference, if, if your loot types are drastically different than your, the number of loot types is drastically different than the number of sources, that disparity starts to become really noticeable, and they will, it matters less that you're trying to vary up the source because you either have a lot of duplicate sources or you won't see a particular source won't be the best for a long time. So I recommend trying to keep them close, equal or close to equal.

There's another thing I mentioned where you don't have to make a two-dimensional chart. You could make extra axes. For example, a 3D chart would include, if you did classes in your game, would include classes, so it would be this chart, but when you go through it, it's like, well, the best armor for mages comes from this source, but the best armor for fighters comes from this other source, and that way, when you have a party of people playing, it encourages you to go do different things so that everybody in

 the party can get their best items. You don't have to do that. You could collapse it and say all the sources are the same for all the classes, or you could do what some games do. I know WoW did this where when you, the source drops a token, and when you take the token to a vendor to spend it, you can only buy something that's good for your class, and that way, you could say the best weapon comes from a name drop, but he really drops a token for a weapon, so that will always be good for your class. Good ways to do it. This is just how I did it.

Now, the way this is used by your designers is, let's say a designer comes up to and goes, I just made a really cool bow for a player, and it's about a good level 28 bow. Where should I put it? Well, you go to the chart, and you say, well, weapons at level 28 use GD, so that means a generic drop, which means you will find these bows dropped maybe by, it's, it's on a bandit, just a generic bandit as a chance of dropping. That's where it comes from.

If instead, um, somebody has put in, say, a wolf, and say, hey, I put in this level five wolf, and I'm not sure what to put on it. Well, a level five wolf, a GD is pants. You can have the wolf drop anything. He can drop crafting materials, hides. He can drop teeth or whatever you want to drop, but occasionally, you're find one that has pants. I'm sure he's not wearing him. He ate somebody wearing good pants.

Um, hey, fantasy.

So that's how this chart is used by designers making items, and it's how this chart is used by level designers who are putting in encounters and need to know, what do I populate the loot chart with? The great thing about this is item designers can look at it and go, hey, I'm, I really haven't made up a lot of items for this level range of this item type. I need to put more in. Um, level designers may go, ooh, I don't really have a lot of of loot tables at this level range that have this thing. I need to add more named creatures, or I need to have more, uh, I need a quest in this level range because we, it's kind of stark here. There's nothing dropping in this level range for quests.

It's a good way of keeping your game balanced in lots of different ways and coordinating it through one chart that you share with the entire design team.

That took longer than I thought. Anyway, that took almost as long as the, the game economy video. The game economy video itself, that's how I do. That's my theory of loot table construction. I hope this helps. It's not the only way, but it's the way I find helps balance as many things as possible in one simple, easy to make, and easy to read chart. Hope that helped.

Lord Of Light CRPG.md

https://youtu.be/hglS31y7ZbE?si=YilWf_pg_aW0sujy

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim. Today, I want to answer another question, this one from Aramel Whisperwind, who asks, "I read Lord of Light a couple days ago based on your recommendation in one of your earlier videos. Now I'm sitting here thinking about your notes and how it would translate into a CRPG. Perhaps you could talk about that."

Okay, my favorite book. This is my Eastman Press copy, which is gilded and leather-bound. Smells really good. So, I looked through that and looked through some of my notes, and this is what I came up with.

So, first of all, I've always talked about the three important things about any RPG that you design: first, which is setting, mechanics, and story. So, let's talk about what I would do for those three things for Lord of Light.

First of all, setting. I think this setting very much needs to support exploration by the player. That's what you want to do in an RPG, you want to get out there. So, what I would do is I'd go through the book and look at all the really cool places that are mentioned and sometimes only lightly touched upon but never really fleshed out by Zelazny. For example, he mentions a bunch of cities, but he barely talks about what's in them. There's also the Mothers of the Terrible Glow, which all we know is live underwater and emit some terrible glow. We don't know anything about them. Only one of them survived in the book, but we could set this before the time where the gods were going around getting rid of all these terrible monsters and imprisoning demons, so the player can be active in that time period. They also mention Zelazny mentions that there are witches on the Eastern continent who do not truck with the gods. Maybe that's a separate crew spin-off that didn't set themselves up as gods and instead set themselves up as witches. You have to question, you know, what was it like before the demons were imprisoned? We know they make deals with people. If maybe you can find a demon, he will do things for you, but you have to offer things to him, gamble with him, and they say they honor their gambling debts. That could be interesting. What kind of information was there on vanished or Earth, which is what they called Earth, you know? Could you uncover clues about the Star of India, which was the ship that arrived here, about what happened to Earth, about the God slash crew? I think there'd be interesting things to embed in the setting so the player can explore around.

Now, the mechanics. This mechanics have to be reminiscent of the book but still allow kind of aspiration on the side of the player. Part of me wonders if I should make it skill-based, you know, put skills in perks based on a pre-industrial fantasy world that is Lord of Light. But part of me wondered if I would do classes because when I get later, I'm gonna talk about putting the game in two stages. The class you pick in the first stage isn't necessarily going to restrain you during the second stage. And then he mentioned that there were soldiers and monks and priests and thieves, so it sounds like we got the beginning of a pretty good class system already in the book. And that, of course, would help me bundle a lot of the skills and traits together. If you have a class in stage one, later on, when you become a god or be offered godhood, which is what I'll get to, it might inform what kind of godhood you're offered.

So, I think it's important that the story that the player play through is not the book story. That's why I'm saying either set it early when there was the all the monsters and demons and elementals and all those nasty things were free on the planet, or you could do something like what I described for the Middle Earth game we were going to make, the Lord of the Rings game, where the player was in the shadow Fellowship, which was a fellowship that was doing things ahead of The Fellowship of the Ring. They were kind of clearing the way but they ended up going their own path because they got up over the pass of the pass that got snowed in, and the fellowship the ring couldn't get across it, you did. So, you went did the other side of the mountains. Similarly, you could have a player going and do things that were mentioned in the book but the gods aren't really involved there. Maybe you hear about the Buddha, but you don't actually go see him. Maybe you are present and the reinvention of the bicycle and the printing press, which are then put down and destroyed by gods. Maybe you witness the passing of the Thunder Chariot. All these things can happen and be involved in your story somehow. Maybe you even have a Divine visitation. They said they happen sometimes, either by on a screen or even in person. So, maybe that's you experience a god or two, and you understand how powerful they are. But the basic storyline should involve exploring this world and having your own adventures. Maybe you can even find a magic item or two, which would be just really advanced tech that either the crew lost before they became gods or that a god misplaced, you know, maybe they there was a Divine visitation and he left a wand behind.

So, what I would do is I break the game into story-wise and mechanically, I would break it into two halves. The first half is that standard fantasy game I just described. The second half, though, is where you are approached by an agent of Heaven, possibly a god, and offered godhood. Now, I could see this happening in many ways. If it was a skill-based game, they look at what your higher skills are. If it's a class-based game, they give you something based on your class. It doesn't necessarily have to be that. It could be that that's what they offer, but you can say, "Oh, I'd rather, oh, I know I have really good skills in this, and you think I should be a fire god, but I really want to be a thieving god. Let me do that." So, I could see you deciding your aspect and attribute with maybe bonuses if you pick something along the line of how you played in stage one. And then you get a very primitive aspect and primitive attribute, maybe you can barely do anything or you can't do anything at all psychically yet, but they give you an item and maybe an article of clothing to let you seem like you can do some stuff. And every time you go up a level, you gain a stronger aspect, and you start to develop your attributes. You can do things without having an item, and that'd be really cool. You're effectively developing mental powers, you know, superpowers, psychic powers, telekinesis, whatever we want to call it, you're developing it. And at the same time, what you do is very different than the first stage fantasy game. You're getting quests from Heaven. Maybe you're the one who goes out and puts down inventions of bicycles and printing presses. Maybe there is a demon that didn't get imprisoned by Sam, and you're sent out to deal with it. Maybe they discover some of the other creatures that have escaped the earlier pilgrims that the god did. So, maybe there's

 a mother of the terrible glow out there. Maybe you gotta go deal with a zombie outbreak. There's things going on. Ultimately, as you play along that arc, you have to decide, are you going to support or oppose Heaven? If you support heaven, then you're against all the other factions. You will put down inventors. You will go after demons. You will go after Naridi the Black. Or maybe you can join one of those factions. Maybe your fight for the people, maybe you're doing what Sam did and say, "I'm gonna join with the demons and fight Heaven." Maybe you do what nobody did in the book, and you're like, "I think Neridi the Black and his zombie army is the way to go," and maybe you join that. What I love about this is all of this is hinted at in the books, but it's not anything that happened in the book. But the elements are there.

So, I think that this gives us a really good basis for a CRPG design. It's got a really cool setting with tons of exploration. It has a really good set of system mechanics. And what I love about it is it's got two sets of system mechanics: stage one fantasy player, stage two god. And then it has a really good story you could play, which is standard fantasy story where you, you know, raising power and maybe get your own keep or castle or town, and then finally you become a god and you have to decide what faction are you going to join, what is the ultimate outcome of this planet going to be, and then you play your role in it.

So, I think a Lord of Light CRPG would be really neat. I think carefully crafted, it could really pay homage to the book, and I think it's something that Zelazny would think is cool. I certainly think that I wouldn't do what Foundation, Rings of Power, and Wheel of Time, which is kind of a reimagining of this. I don't think it needs to be reimagined. I think the elements of a really cool game are in here already.

So, I hope that answered your question, Aramel Whisperwind, and you know, leave a comment. Leave what you would like to do with this book if, especially if people read this book. Oh, the one thing I forgot to mention, the book goes backwards and forwards in time, or it starts and then it jumps way back and then it moves forward past where it started. I would not do that in a game. That is very, it was confusing enough to read. I think that would be very confusing in the game, so I would not support something like that. Otherwise, I think the book makes a great basis for a game. So, let me know what you think.

Making And Maintaining An IP.md
Youtube Link:
https://youtu.be/waUjJ2VjvaE?si=ypfT5dKzmW304Qax

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim, and today I want to talk about making and maintaining an IP. By IP, I mean intellectual property. Now, I've talked about writing design docs and how to make a good setting, so I'm going to link those two videos below. This is something different. I want to talk about intellectual property in general. Intellectual property is more than your setting; it's more than your story. Those are specific to a game. I'm talking about the intellectual property as a whole: the tone, the art style, the distinct core essence of your idea. That's what I think of as an IP. So yes, it does include the setting, but it's not like Fallout; the setting is a post-nuclear world. Fallout, the IP, the game, was this part of Southern California. So that's the difference I'm thinking of, and I want to break this up into making an IP—how can you tell what a good IP is and you're on a good track to make a good IP—and then maintaining an IP, which is doing more things in that IP past the first game, like sequels.

### Making

An IP, like I said, should have a very distinct core essence. You should be able to express your IP in a single sentence. That is the simplest, most straightforward definition I can think of for a good IP. Maybe it'll take you two sentences, but basically, if you have to write an entire three pages to get the idea of your IP across, it's probably too complicated. Let me give you some examples. Arcanum's IP sentence was a fantasy world that's undergoing an industrial revolution. Already, that starts you thinking about things like, "Oh my goodness, it's definitely going to have orcs and elves, but it's also going to have factories, trains, iron mines, unions, and pollution," and it just starts you thinking about all these things that aren't normally in a fantasy realm. That sentence is evocative, and that's true for any IP you make. I think I've mentioned the elevator pitch three-word sentence for The Outer Worlds was "Fallout meets Firefly." Immediately, that makes you think of all these evocative things. It's going to be set in space but it's going to have the clunky tech and the kind of dark setting that you expect in a Fallout game, and the kind of humor that you get in Fallout and Firefly.

### Uniqueness

In addition to that single sentence, I think it's really important if your IP can be reduced to and easily recognized by an icon. And there may be more than one icon, but it should be very unique. For example, Fallout: we had the vault door, that geared vault door, was very iconic to Fallout. Vault Boy, of course, super iconic; there are hundreds of him appearing in those skill decks cards and in the manual and in cinematics. You see Vault Boy, and you think Fallout. You talk about Fallout, you eventually think about Vault Boy. Those two are intertwined. The Outer Worlds, we didn't go out of our way to do that, but the Moonman ended up being our iconic figure, and Spacer's Choice—"It's not the best choice, it's Spacer's Choice"—did become a very recognizable slogan connected to The Outer Worlds. Going outside of games, you see this happen everywhere. Star Wars: the X-Wing Fighter is very distinctive to Star Wars. You don't see things like it in other sci-fi movies. The lightsaber, very distinctive for Star Wars, not just its look, its sound, the vibe of it, the idea that people would be using a sword made of light is not only really cool but showing how it holds up against, you know, ray guns. You're like, "Wow, this makes sense," and it's very cool and it easily makes it distinct.

So when you're making your IP, make sure that your idea is very distinct. Notice I didn't say unique, I said distinct. It can be something similar to what people have heard before, but different. So, Arcanum being a standard fantasy world, well, we've seen that a billion times. We even referenced Lord of the Rings and Tolkien as our basis, but it's undergoing an industrial revolution. That's different.

### Dilution

Now, once you've made an IP, you should be able to write down a lot of simple rules about it, about things that do and do not appear in your IP. And this should be true for all the games, not just the sequels, so that people understand this is what belongs in this world, and this is what doesn't. And you should make those rules pretty firm. I've mentioned in the past that I don't like making sequels. I like to move on to new IPs and explore those. Part of the reason I feel this way is staying in an IP is really hard. It's a hard thing to do because you've already explored it, you already made a game or book or movie that explored that IP. If you have to keep doing it, one of two things tends to happen: you either find new areas within that IP to explore, or you dig down deeper into the area you did before, and you have a tendency to overanalyze it. Both of these things that can happen in a sequel lead to the same problem, which is dilution of the IP.

An IP gets diluted when it is now unclear what can and cannot appear in it, when the crux of the main one has either been overanalyzed or spread out into areas it shouldn't be, and it's just too much. You're getting either too much of a good thing or the good thing has been spread out so much that it's no longer a good thing. And I can give examples. I've mentioned this about Fallout before, so I don't feel like I'm complaining about Fallout in a way I've never done before, but I feel like the Fallout IP is being diluted. I did it myself in Fallout 2. I was the one who added the ghost to the den, and I remember Chris Avellone telling me I shouldn't do that. At the time, I was like, "No, I like this. I like putting supernatural in," but now that I've had years to think about it, Fallout doesn't need supernatural, and it shouldn't have it because it pushes back the definition of the IP and makes it too broad suddenly. And by doing that, now the IP for Fallout is diluted. You have supernatural stuff. If you have ghosts, why can't you have vampires, why can't you have afterlife, poltergeists, raising people from the dead? You have ghosts; you've basically weakened the IP. I've said this about synths, which I saw mentioned in and play a little role in Fallout 3 and then are huge in Fallout 4. I don't think they belong because Fallout went out of its way to establish what kind of technology it had. Changing that, I get why people were like, "No, it's okay to change it in a sequel." For me, that just broadens the IP and therefore dilutes it and therefore weakens it. The whole point of Fallout was supposed to be what the '50s predicted the future would be. Synth, I think, doesn't fit into that, but more so

, when I play some of the later games in the series and I see '50s props everywhere, I'm like, "Well, this now feels like the war happened in the '50s, not this is what the '50s predicted the future would be, and here's all the cool tech and stuff." So again, the IP has been diluted, and every time you make a sequel, that's how you run the risk of doing that. You run the risk of kind of weakening the base core concept of your IP. In fact, the whole summary of this video could be IPs need to be kept very simple and very distinct. Don't dilute it, which is exactly what most sequels and extensions of any kind, even DLCs, do. They run the risk of diluting the IP and making it less strong.

I highly recommend you watch my how to write design and how to create a good setting videos, but if you like what I was talking about here, what made me think of this was a really good video on a YouTube channel called Like Stories of Old, and I'll link it below. I think it was called the moralize dive into this dilution and weakening of IP and how that's happened in more recent cinema than it did in the past, and I think he does a way better job of explaining this than I do. So if you liked what I said here, I'll put the link in for this Like Stories of Old video below, and you can watch it because I think he does a way better job of describing what I'm talking about than I do.

Anyway, I hope this helps you make a new IP and understand why I have never been too interested in doing sequels.

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim. Today I want to talk about making good factions for your games. This is something that every time I go into making a setting, and remember, I think setting is the first step of what you need to do to make a game. I always try to think of what kind of factions are going to be there. And just to be clear, what I'm going to talk about, I'm talking about designing the factions, not writing the factions, not writing dialogues for particular characters. I'm not good at that, but I am talking about making factions that you've designed so that they seem like they belong in your world and have their own goals and are just fun to interact with. I'm going to talk about how I think you should go about doing that. I'm going to use examples from Fallout because that is the oldest game where I did this, and at this point, I don't believe there can possibly be any spoilers for that game, although when I talked about China nuking first, apparently that was a big spoiler for people. Anyway, we're going to talk about Fallout, so let's dive into it.

First of all, when you're designing a faction, you really want to make sure that it's not a simple monolithic entity. So the factions I'm thinking of in Fallout, things like the mutants, the Brotherhood of Steel, Junktown, The Hub, these were not simplistic monolithic where everybody in those factions all felt the same thing, acted the same way, treated the player the same way. What I liked about him was there were all sorts of characters that could be written to be part of those factions. I give you an example, in the mutant faction, the Master, the Lieutenant, those were very different characters than your standard dumb mutant that you'd encounter in combat. In the Brotherhood of Steel, you had free, the scientist, or Rhombus, or Cabot at the front door. These were very different characters from each other and from a typical Brotherhood of Steel Grunt in power armor.

Now, let me digress a little bit into writing, even though I won't be telling you how to write because that would be a whole another video done by a Hally different person. But when you have to write, you have to make sure that you write different kinds of characters. I think I've even said multiple times I'm so tired of narrative designers who think that sarcasm is the first and best and most Touchstone e way to make a character. I've seen so many sarcastic characters that if I didn't, if I played a game that didn't have any sarcastic character, I'd be happy. It's, it's too much of the go-to, it's too easy, it's too obvious. So if you're thinking of a character and his the main point of this character is he's really sarcastic, think again. Um, I punted several of those characters for my games, on the only com, uh, feedback was this character is sarcastic, we have enough of those, figure something else out. There's a whole bunch of ways you can make characters. You can make characters that are really smart, really, I mean the character themselves are intelligent. They are thinking of everything like a scientist. They want data, they want information, they're trying to be logical in whatever they're doing. You can have dumb characters, you know, that are just as dumb as the player character when he gets dumb dialogue. Those are fun, you know, you're trying to outsmart them or at least in one case in Fallout out dumb them, so you can get past them, and that's fun to do. You can make characters that are violent, that their first Touchstone, their first, you know, course of action is just violence. Just, you say anything wrong, they're gonna kill you, or they're gonna, you know, they don't want you part of their group or whatever. They're very insular. That's pretty fun. You can make characters that are passive, that are very easy to, for the player to convince of things, just go along with what the player is thinking. Um, those are fun characters to have when you write dialogue for player characters that are, um, skill-based. We have dialogue skills. Those are fun characters.

And so, to make a fun faction, you've got to have room in it to have all kinds of characters. If it's monolithic, if everybody who's part of that faction acts the exact same way, that's bad. Now, that isn't to say that the faction doesn't have a goal that most of the people in the faction would support, but they'd support it in their own way. For example, and usually, you want that faction to have really realistic goals, so that it makes sense when the player learns about them. For example, the mutants seem to just be attacking people, but once you learn more, you find out they're raiding, they're raiding towns, and they're raiding vaults. And as you get far enough along in the story, you find out that they're looking for humans to dip in the Vats, and they've recently figured out that humans that have less radiation turn into better mutants when they get dipped in bats of FEV. So their raids are concentrating on finding what they call Prime humans, humans that didn't receive a lot of radiation or haven't gone out much. That's why places like, you know, towns are better because there might be some people never leave the town or rarely leave the town, and maybe they have less exposure to radiation. When the Master heard about vaults, he really started sending out his mutant squats to try to uncover locations of vaults because vaults are full of prime humans, especially the ones that never opened. So once you learn that, you're like, oh, that makes sense to me. I see what's going on here. And also, because there's a bunch of dumb mutants among the raiding parties, and then there's people like the Lieutenant, you're like, oh, I get it. I get why there are different kinds of mutants and why the smarter ones are rarer. It just starts to make sense, and that's what I love about those factions. They support the storyline.

The Brotherhood of Steel in Fallout was another good faction because you discover that their goal is to find and preserve technology. But you're like, wait a minute, we've have cases of them attacking and destroying stuff. Yes, they destroy anything they leave behind to make sure it doesn't fall into the wrong hands. From the Brotherhood's point of view, this entire post-apocalypse was caused by technology in the wrong hands, and from their point of view, the only right hands are their hands. They are very insular, however. They don't like people to know where their base is. They let very few people into it. They are not a police force. They don't go out and police human settlements. The only time they leave their vault is to look for Tech, to get Tech, blueprints of tech, examples of working Tech, and to destroy all the rest of the tech. That's their goal, that's their raison d'être.

Now, you may go, why do I need to make these factions like this, and why do I have to come up with these

 goals and these variety of people? Well, first of all, it's realistic. For those of you who think that's good, personally, I don't care about this, but I threw it in my list because people well, it's realistic to be the way, sure it is. I don't really care about that. The thing I care about is factions like the ones that described that are non-monolithic and have goals and a variety of characters in them can be used to support the story. If you're making stories that take place in the Wasteland, you're going to need a lot of NPCs that either help or oppose the player for different reasons. By making factions that have goals and lots of different characters in them, no matter what the character the player character is trying to do, every faction probably has someone within it that would help or oppose them and therefore get involved in that part of the story. Similarly, having factions with lots of different characters in them supports a lot of the different player character builds. If you're making a very combat-oriented character, then it's good that there are some NPCs in each of these factions that fight because that's what you do. And it's not fun just mowing everyone down. It's kind of fun, but you want some kind of challenge in each one of these factions, so they're like really powerful guards in the Hub. The mutants are all pretty powerful, especially the ones that wearing armor and use miniguns. The Brotherhood of Steel, they're rough, a tough faction to take on, combat-oriented. But if you make a talking character, you still want NPCs in all those factions you can interact with. There are tons of people to talk to in the Hub. There are some smart mutants like the Lieutenant and stuff that you can have interactions with. And when you discover the Cathedral and all the followers that are there, they can be talked with too. So it's fun that it supports that kind of character. And if you make a sneak character, in Fallout, all of those factions have big maps that you can sneak around, you can steal stuff, you can pickpocket people. There's a lot of fun things to do and good items to find because those factions are big and rich, and we deliberately put in stuff to support those kinds of characters.

But I think the single probably most important thing of having big, rich factions is it supports lots of players, not player characters but players. There are some players that love humor. They love talking to funny NPCs. There are a few players who love sarcastic NPCs. You can have them. I'm just like, I think they've been overused. Um, and they're also, that's just a form of humor too. There are some players that like mean NPCs. They like them because either they themselves are mean and like, oh, there's a fellow mean NPC. I'm glad I'm supported when I'm wiping out all these people. But they also like mean NPCs because it gives them a reason to take them out or screw them over, whether it's attacking them or stealing all their stuff. They justify by going, well, they're mean. So by having these big, rich factions that have lots of different characters in them, no matter what kind of player character the player makes, the player still is going to have a preference for what kind of NPCs they like to interact with. So having lots of NPCs ensures that there's no one faction that the player feels, oh, this is the only faction I can support. In fact, one of the things I loved the most about Fallout New Vegas was at some point, I could not figure out what faction to support, so I ended up saving the game, and I've replayed it, supporting House, supporting Yes Man, supporting Caesar's Legion. I just, I supporting NCR. I just wanted to see what would happen, and I liked people in all of those, so I liked joining them, and I liked opposing them. I played once where I blew up the Brotherhood of Steel. I felt bad about it, but I wanted to see what would happen, and there were some characters down there I didn't like.

So, what's the TL;DW? I know it's too late, but here it is. If you're making a game, definitely have multiple factions. But within those multiple factions, definitely put lots of different kinds of characters. The faction can have a goal, and it should be a realistic goal that all of the different characters in the faction support in their own way. But because you have lots of different characters in that faction, there's a lot of different ways that different player characters can interact with them, and there's lots of things that will attract that faction to different kinds of players. So, try to make as many different factions as you can, with very different faction members. And that's pretty much it.

Making of Bard's Tale Construction Set (1991).md
Youtube Link:
https://youtu.be/v9j5k3K29Rw?si=CkYNgBGNk6OO0d6p

Hi, it's me Tim. Today I want to talk about the making of Bard's Tale Construction Set. That was the first game I made at Interplay, and I was a contractor. I didn't get hired until after the game came out. The way it all came about, in late '90, my father passed away. We weren't terribly close; my parents had divorced when I was young, but the impact of having a parent die, especially he was only 57 (he's my age now), and I was only—I thought I was 24; I was 25. And I was still in grad school, and it just made me rethink what I wanted to do. I was on course to become a college professor. I rethought that.

I had so much fun making Grandstand Bridge, and I'd never stopped making games. In fact, I'll do a video about—I got really involved in the MUD scene, multi-user dungeon. I'll do a whole video about that because, ironically, it ties a little bit into Fallout. But what I did was, in early '91, I went to the bookstore and bought several computer gaming magazines, like Computer Gaming World, PC Gamer—I forget which ones they were—and I went through the ads, and every video game company that had an address, I sent a resume to. I don't remember how many I sent, but I got two responses. One was 360 Pacific, which I think was in Oregon. The other one was just a few miles from where I lived. I was on campus at UC Irvine, and over in Santa Ana was a company called Interplay, which I'd heard of, and I played Bard's Tale Two. I hadn't finished it because I was in the gold box games, and I'm like, okay, I'm gonna play this.

So I responded, they responded to my letter, I called them up, I talked to someone named Tom Decker, who later on I would work for, and I got an interview. I was so nervous about the interview that I went to a friend of mine, John Roy, and asked if I could borrow one of his suits, and he gave me this really fancy, expensive Italian suit. And if—oh man, it fit so well, I was like, this is a nice suit. I went in for the interview. The receptionist thought I was their insurance salesman. So as soon as I walked in, says, "Oh yeah, your appointment's very soon." I'm like, "Great." I sat down, and then she said, "Okay, you'll be meeting with so-and-so from HR." And I'm like, "Shouldn't I be meeting Tom?" She goes, "What's your name again?" and I told her, and she said, "Oh, I thought you were our insurance salesman. No programmer shows up here in a suit." By the way, Jesse Reynolds showed up for his interview a few years later at Interplay in a suit, and yes, I made fun of him for it.

Anyway, so I had my interview with Tom, and he told me there was someone else who had applied for the job, and she and I were neck and neck. We had about the same amount of experience. I think she might have even made a game before, and I had one game under my belt already, I had Grand Slam Bridge published by Electronic Arts. By the way, that was the interview where Tom actually looked—he owned a copy of Grandstand Bridge, and he looked at it, and my name, my name is not the credits, and that's where I found out. I was really upset. He said later that he believed that I worked on it because I looked so honestly upset that my name wasn't there. But what sealed the deal for this job was he said it was a Bard's Tale, and that was, you know, like D&D, and I said, "Oh, I play D&D all the time." And he said, "Can you tell me what THAC0 is?" I was very excited. I proceeded to tell him that THAC0 stood for "to hit Armor Class 0," that for the classes in D&D, there were four THAC0 tables based on the base classes of fighter, cleric, thief, and magic user. Then I told him what the THAC0s were for level one against ACs, what the number was for the THAC0, and said, "And the trick is, you can take whatever your armor class is and subtract it from THAC0 to get your to-hit value. So if the THAC0's 18, then AC 10, you only need an eight." And I said, "But it doesn't work for a magic user because THAC0's repeated six times, and that isn't the first 20 on the magic user column." Tom had been quiet during this entire exuberant explanation and he said, "Yes, THAC0 is to hit Armor Class 0." That's all he wanted. I found out later that the other programmer, she didn't know what THAC0 was, and he was impressed and a little taken aback at how detailed my answer was, but he said, "Yes, you certainly played D&D." So I got the contract. It was a 14-week contract, 14 weeks to make Bard's Tale Construction Set, using the code from the original Bard's Tale, which I was told was a black box, meaning I should be able to lift that code up, set it down, and just shove new data into it. So what they really were hiring me to do is to write editors for data so that a the player of our construction set could create an item, or a monster, or a new spell, and just fill in data.

Problem: I was supposed to come in every two weeks. A few days later, I called Tom and said, "This code is not a black box." I actually drove over; it wasn't too far away, and I showed him like, deep, buried deep into combat code, there was a line that said, "If monster equals 59, then do dragon breath." This is all C code; it was so not a black box. I mean, there's no way I could use that. There's no way that combat code could be considered a black box. Who knows what monster 59 was going to be? And obviously, it was a dragon, but there was no enumerations for types. There were monsters didn't have a drop-down for a type, didn't have an enumeration set in them, so I could go, "Oh, this type is Dragon, so let's see if it's time to do dragon breath." All the rules for like, how often something could happen, like you could—how often think Dragon was hard-coded, so there's no way to change it. And these were all things they wanted done. There was another problem, too, is they couldn't find the source code for the version they wanted me to build it off of. I think they wanted me to build it off of Bard's Tale Two. I don't remember with two or three, but they couldn't find the English version, so they gave me the German version. And I don't read German. And yes, the strings were embedded in the code, so I was like, "I

—I can't do this. This can't be done in 14 weeks." So first, I got, "Spielvo, you agreed to do it in 14 weeks." And I said, "I also you agreed it was black box." So I will do what you asked for, but it won't work. I will write editors for data and put it into the code that you said was Black Box; it won't work. But if you're going to stick to the letter of this contract, so will I. That kind of worked. They assigned another programmer to do the—when you're playing Bard's Tale, there's some data up here, there's rolling text here, and then there's a picture here, and the picture is animated, so it might be a person pretending to talk; it wasn't lip-synced. It might be a monster, you know, doing this. They got another programmer, Phil Britt, to do all of that. And that was actually a lot of work because, again, that wasn't something that was easy to extract in the code. But also, I wasn't really that up to speed on PC graphics. If this was an Atari, boom. It also meant that he interfaced with some of the artists a little more than I did. I like talked to Todd Camaster, who was their 2D art Master. Todd was an amazing artist. And I did things like the menus and—and um, editors and things like that, but Phil worked with them on all the animations. So that was great. That let um, that freed me up to basically spend weeks, and I was doing this all in my dorm at UCI. And there wasn't room anywhere else, so I pretty much threw everything off my desk in my bedroom and plopped a computer down, which they supplied because my PC couldn't handle this. It was in VGA, not super VGA, but my computer was EGA. That's how old things were.

Oh, and our construction had to run in VGA, EGA, and CGA. CGA was four colors, and you didn't get to pick them. It was black, white, they were called cyan and magenta. Even back then, my color vision was so bad, it kind of looked like an off-white, and then this puke-iest purpley color that I've ever seen. I don't know who picked those, some insane person. But it had to run in all three of those modes. Luckily, the resolution was the same, so it was 320 by 200, either in Four Color, 16 color, or 256 color. Honestly, I really think it only looked good and played well in VGA, but they just wanted to support it to make it backward compatible. So I went back to doing all this work. Funny story, the very first check they sent me bounced. I got paid when I went in every two weeks to say Tom, they paid me a check. At some point, and I forget how many weeks in, I took it to my bank. The next day, the bank called me and said that check balanced, and I was like, "Oh." And they said, "There's a fee for bouncing." I was like, "Ah." Caught up in her play, talked to HR. Uh, the one there apologized, said that they had such a constant payroll amount that she forgot to increase it when they brought me on as a contractor. She issued me a new check, plus the amount of the bounce fee. Everything was good. She was mortified. I was like, "Look, it's fine. It's fine." I didn't tell her that as a grad student, I pretty much lived, you know, paycheck to paycheck. And now that I was doing this job, I didn't sign up to be a TA, uh, teaching assistant, which I normally did every quarter. Which that was interesting because, even though it was an AI grad student, I ended up TA-ing programming languages, operating systems because that one was at eight in the morning, and I was the only one would get up that early, a whole bunch of things that were not AI-related. But I didn't do that anymore, so I could do this.

Anyway, we finished it. There was quite a big bug push at the end, but we had really good QA. Um, that was where I met Chris Taylor. When I'd go in every two weeks to talk to Tom, Chris Taylor would often come in and just stand there and listen, and I didn't know who he was. He would just stand there at the wall, going. And it turns out he was just really excited about this being made. Um, kind of wanted to be part of it, just loved coming in and having me say every few weeks, "This feature's in, like you could do this, you can do this, you can make maps, you can make spells, you can make traps, you can make monsters." Um, we finished it up, got it debugged, it shipped in the fall. I want to say October of 1991. The first game I'd had out since Grandstand Bridge in '86. It got reviewed in the Dragon magazine a few months later and got five stars. I was stoked. I mean, I had a subscription to Dragon magazine. Have my—a game with my name on it in Dragon Magazine. That was cool.

So, of course, that was so much fun. Went home for Christmas break, back to Virginia, visited my family, came back, and basically told Tom, "I want a full-time job in the game industry, and I hope it can be an Interplay, because that's where I want to do it. I want to make more RPGs with you guys, but I'll send my resume out if that's not possible." And Tom went to bat for me, and I got the job. So, that is the story of the very first game that I ever made for Interplay.

Making Rags To Riches (1993).md
Youtube Link:
https://youtu.be/_aDdWpYcIok?si=mUrVHvI4AqeolAp8

Hi, it's me Tim. Today, I want to talk about *Rags to Riches*, which is the first game I made at Interplay as an employee. So, the previous game I made there, *Bardstyle Construction Set*, I was a contractor, so I did it all at home and I would come in weekly for them to check the progress of what I was doing. But *Rags to Riches*, I got hired as an employee. This was in very early, I think it was January of '92. They had completely filled up, Interplay had filled up all their offices, so they had rented an upstairs office at the in the building they were in. That one was also filled up. So when I was hired, my desk was in the... I was told it was the vestibule, it was basically the hallway into the office between two producers. I had Rusty Buchert on one side, who was very stressed out. I worked at Interplay for six years. I don't believe I saw Rusty in an unstressed state. And Bill Dugan, very tall, lanky fellow, he was the producer which event he was the producer would eventually become producer on Mac play. The way he introduced himself to me that day is he leaned over the cubicle wall and over top of me and just said, "Hey, I'm Bill Dugan, producer. Who the hell are you?" That was day one.

So I was assigned to work on *Rags to Riches* under Tom Decker, who was my producer on large gel construction set. This is the first game that I made that was both super VGA and the first game where I was the only coder. There were other programmers on *Bard scale Construction Set* and other ones on *Grandstand Bridge*, but every line of code in *Rags to Riches* was my own pristine, flawless diamond C code. It also was my first super VGA game. Super VGA was a new mode that video cards were supporting. Before that, we had VGA, which topped out at 320x240, 256 color. Super VGA could do 640x480, 256 color. But because the way memory mapping worked on a PC, you could only access 64k of a video screen at once. 64k was enough to do 320 by 240, but not 640x480. In fact, you needed to memory map it into five regions and then Bank switch between those regions. It was called Bank switching. Thanks for watching. Not only had to be done in Assembly Language, but it was different for every single video card. And not just by brand and not just by model within the brand, but there were video cards I'm looking at you, Trident 9600, that came with different chipsets. They had chipset A, B, and C, and all three of them did Bank switching in a different way. This predates VESA, which was a standards for him how to do super VGA. So when the game started up, we'd ask people, "Do you know what video card you have?" Most people didn't. And even if they did, even if they like, I remember buying a Trident 9600, they might not have known what set was on it. I'm not even sure that was on the box. If you looked at the card and knew which chip to look at, you could see the chipset, um, model number with the suffix letter. So we had a way of detecting it. It wasn't a hundred percent. So when we made the game, it was like, "Pick your lip, pick your video card off this list or let us detect it for you." And then, thankfully, right before we shipped and the VESA standards came out, I could say, "If you have the VESA driver running, I'll just use that." So that was fun, and that was the first thing I had to do. Um, it was just hard wrapping my head around it. I think *Rags to Riches* is the first Super VGA game that Interplay made, so I was in untested waters.

The game itself was based on a board game called *Speculation*, made by Lee Audrey. Um, we would talk to him about how the board game worked, and Tom and I were trying to convert it to how a computer game would adapt to those roles. What I remember the most is I received so many design documents on napkins. I may even still have one. I looked, I couldn't find it. It was a picture of Lucy Luster, and she's like, "Buy gold!" and then a swear word. Um, Tom and I would go to lunch frequently. I forget why we were doing this. We were trying to find the best Caesar salad in Orange County. I don't know how that became a goal. So we would frequently have lunch together and talk about *Rags to Riches* and things I had to do, you know, like I'd be coding that morning, I'd run into problems, and I'd ask Tom what to do, and sometimes he'd design right there in the restaurant. Um, by the way, the best salad I think we found was at Marie Callender's. They had a really good Caesar salad with chicken. That was a good salad. And I believe that's where he drew the Lucy Luster napkin design document. So that's kind of how stuff worked in the '90s.

And let me just tell you, I loved working on *Rags to Riches*. It was, I love being back at a game company. I loved the vibe, the feel of how everything worked. It was very vibrant. Um, but one office next to me, there was a programmer, Mark Whittlesey. Mark was working on *Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers*. I was super jealous. I read, read the *Lord of the Rings*. I've reread it multiple times. I wanted that project. Imagine how surprised I was when I was talking to Mark to find out he had a degree in economics, and he wanted to do *Rags to Riches*. So we hatched a brilliant idea or go to Alan Pavlish, the executive producer, and say, "Hey, we're going to swap projects." Brilliant idea. We, we both are experienced programmers. Why not put us on the project that we are most suited for and love and are passionate about? Alan said no. I still remember the meeting. He listened to both of our arguments on why Mark wanted to be on *Rags to Riches* and why I wanted to be on *Lord of the Rings*. And he said, "We can't let people work on the projects they want to because what if we're making a game that no one wants to make?" And there was this long pause, and Mark and I kind of side-eyed each other, and then I went, "Okay, I'll ask. Why would Interplay make a game that no one at Interplay wanted to make?" And he was like, "Well, contracts and obligations." And I've like, "Okay, I get it, but why not just swap us? You don't have to say anything. The projects are both relatively small. No one would know." And he said, "No, people would find out. It would

 set a bad precedent."

So I finished *Rags*, and Mark finished *Two Towers*. *Rags* shipped in late '93. That was the time I had chickenpox. I mentioned this in something else. I had a really bad bout of chickenpox. I was, I also got strep throat on top of it. This was in... Chickenpox was so bad that year that some adults were getting it who had had it as children. It was such a virulent strain, and a few adults in Orange County died of the strain I had. It really bad, with strep throat. I was taking massive antibiotics. I was out for two weeks. Interplay got so desperate that they sent Tom's assistant producer, Fred Royal (not Fred Hatch, that my assistant producer later involved), but Fred Royal to my house, carrying my desktop. So I answered the door, and Fred just took a step back. I was like, "Oh my God." I looked horrible. I was covered in splotches and that. And he goes, "They want you to finish the game." And I was like, "I can't sit up. I literally can't sit upright for more than an hour. This is not happening."

So when I got back after being out for two weeks, and I believe Bill Dugan saw me went, "Oh dear lord, what's wrong with your face?" Um, I had to Crunch for a few weeks to try to get that game out, which was very weird to Crunch when you're in that state. Really nice, there was another programmer, Christa Salvo, who eventually did the Mac version of canal for *Fallout*, which is a whole other story. Chris actually, there was one night I did an all-nighter. Now, I'd gone to college and grad school, and I never pulled off an all-nighter there. I just always would fall asleep. I did an all-nighter at Interplay, and Christa Salvo hung out with me to help co-code. He was, you know, he'd look at my code and like, "Hey, I'm not sure what's going wrong here," and he'd go, "Uh, you're missing a semicolon," or something. But he just did it just to help keep me up. And I still remember that night because I remember we were, we were coding, and I looked out the window, and I'm like, "Hey, I think the street lights brightened up." And he goes, "No, that's Dawn." And I realized I had stayed up all night.

So the game shipped in, I think was November of '93. And after that, they didn't have anything for me to work on. I jumped from game to game. I remember doing the critical error Handler on *Stone Keep*, which was... CD-ROMs back then, you could read data, and it would give it to you, and then you could go back to read the data again, it would say, "Yeah, there's no data there. It's or or error." And you'd have to do it multiple times to get the data off of it. And so the critical error Handler I wrote basically allowed, if it ever got an error off of CD-ROM, it try it again and again and again. And you could control it. I wrote, um, *Ganahl*, which was my operating system abstraction Library. That's something that I have to do a whole video on. I also did a lot of installers. That's the time when I was making installers for other games and I had to make so many of them that I eventually wrote an installer installer, which was a program that if you gave it the parameters for your installer, would generate an installer. So I would have like producers come to me on Monday and go, "I need an installer for my game, and I need it by Friday." And I'd go, "Okay," and they'd leave, and I'd be thinking, "I could have it to them by lunch, but I will have it to them by Friday." And I would go back to working on my engines. And I made a voxel engine and a 3D engine, and they were terrible. And I made a Sprite engine, and it was good. And that's what turned into *Fallout*.

So I think it's interesting that *Rags to Riches* and the short period after that is the Genesis of *Fallout*, but you would never have been able to plan for that. It was just a culmination of learning super VGA, uh, trying to make three engines, um, not being assigned to any one direct project, so I could float, and learning a lot about how things worked on the other projects kind of gave me this insight into, "I could put together something here." So because of that, I like to think of *Rags to Riches* as like the first my first Interplay employee game and the game that directly led into everything I did after that. So I like that game, and I'm glad a couple of people ask me questions about it because I haven't talked about it. That's kind of its story.

Marketing The Outer Worlds.md

https://youtu.be/v22ACVVC4C0?si=cEVYqOrzyMbJ08bz

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim, and today I want to talk about marketing and specifically marketing on the outer worlds. Now, I've had a few other videos about the outer worlds and I know people want me to talk more about its development and the team and its design, but the thing is a lot of the things I would talk about are still ongoing with Outer Worlds 2 and proprietary, so there's not as much I can talk about that game. So, I've gone and talked about a lot of my other games, but then it occurred to me there was recently some news you may have seen it about the outer world's hitting 5 million sales. Now, that doesn't include game pass because a lot of people on Xbox played it on Game Pass, so that's not including people played it that way. This is people who bought, I think they call it sell-through, people who bought and have a copy of the outer worlds whether it's physical or digital, and that's a lot. That's, um, I think it's safe to say outer worlds is my best-selling game ever.

Now, I have a video we talk about games quality versus popularity versus sales and all this, and they're correlated, but they're not causation. But it made me want to talk about the marketing because the marketing on this game was a little different, um, and I liked it, and then I'll talk about why it was important if you're thinking about making your own game. So, my early games, especially in the 80s and early 90s, had marketing, but not a lot. You, when your game's coming out, you might get an ad. I mean, early on, for like, um, Grand Sign Bridge, that might be an ad in Byte magazine because there weren't magazines specifically for computer games. Later on, with CGW, we got that, Computer Gaming World. So, like Bart Taale Construction Set, probably got an ad in something like Computer Gaming World. I know though it was reviewed by Dragon Magazine from TSR because I have a copy of the review, and they liked it. They gave it five stars out of five stars, which I thought was very generous. Um, and then I think like Rags to Riches, I think got an ad in Computer Gaming World.

And then with Fallout, we got, well, we got I think two or three ads, but my involvement in most of these games was nothing more than what was called sign-off in other words, they had meetings apparently about these things. I wasn't there. Um, they would put together something, and then it would go into a room when it was all made up, and this is a physical paper mockup. You would go into this room, and only producers were allowed in the room and people, I guess, in marketing and people who were directors and admin, and you would look at it. You would look at this paper mockup, and you'd look at everything. You look at spelling, you'd look at what the phrases were, you'd look at the fonts, the images that were on, and you'd sign off on it if you agreed. And you were partially, sometimes mostly there for accuracy, like, "Oh, this is not a screenshot from our game. This is a mockup we made," or, "Oh, we don't use this phrase in this game." But mostly, we were there to just sign off on it, say, "Yep, this has approval to go out," and then it would go out.

Let me tell you, the outer worlds was very, very, very different than that. Um, it was different in a way that was the first time I'd ever really experienced anything like this. First of all, we had an enormous budget for marketing, um, and because Private Division was part of Take 2, there was a team that was dedicated to Outer Worlds, and they involved us in the marketing campaigns. I mean, they would have meetings, um, sometimes over video, but sometimes they'd fly out because they wanted that one-on-one. They wanted to sit down and just talk with us about what do you think is important in the game, what do you think the tone of the marketing campaign should be, and this is before anything got started, which, from my point of view, was wildly different than what has happened in the past, where people come and go, "Here's your marketing campaign. What do you think?" This was, "Hey, we looked at your game. We played it. We've noticed brand slogans and characters." Like, we did all that without any idea towards marketing. If you think we made the moonman because we're like, "Hey, that'll be marketed well," no, we thought he was funny, especially when Paul, the writer, did the moonman in the helmet. That's a funny character. His name is Martin. Go to the um, ground. I'm so bad with the names. Go to the ship in orbit and go check out Martin. You can't miss him. He's got a giant moonman head. But the slogans we wrote that just were funny and made us laugh, like "It's not the best choice, it's Spacer's Choice," were things that the people from Take 2 marketing really wanted to pick up on, and I, I mean, I love that. I love that it got picked up on like that and was used within the ads themselves.

And we had lots of meetings about, rather than them inventing stuff, them wanting to pull things that we had invented from the game to use in the marketing, and they actually hired, and I'm going to name them because they were so good, there's a company in LA called Buddha Jones. They were phenomenal. Um, they played the game and watched gameplay footage. There was one guy on the team who had played several of our older games, and he was super excited to be on this. He had has to be on it because he goes, "I want to be involved in the marketing campaign for this game." And what was really interesting is the first time they came down, I thought they were going to pitch us things, but they came down in person. They just wanted to talk to us about the game. They wanted to talk about the nature of the game and its humor because this was a new IP, and there's something really, really hard to market. It is when your game is brand new. Sure, you know, if you're making a Call of Duty marketing campaign, you literally have, what, a dozen games to pull on? People know what Call of Duty is. Nobody knew what the outer worlds was, and it had a very specific kind of humor, and they wanted to get it. They really, really wanted to dig down into the outer worlds and see what, what made it tick, what it was like, and they ended up making so many good trailers. The advertising trailers for outer world were made by Buddha Jones. They were so good. Um, really good footage. They loved, um, when we started showing them the science weapons and things like that. Some of those showed up. We didn't want to give them all away, but some of those showed up were just people explosions and people flying, people being chased by monsters. It was great, and they also picked really good music choices. I mean

, if you looked at the those trailers and those ads, they have really good music choices. Never in a million years would I thought I'd make a game trailer that would have "Blister in the Sun" as its marketing song, but it was great.

And what I really loved about Buddha Jones was, it took them a while. It's hard to get humor, but they got the humor. So, what they gave back to us as ideas for trailers and songs and elements to show in those trailers from the game were spot-on. That kind of [Music] um, working together. I know there's a word for it, but that kind of, um, coherence between a development team and a marketing team, in my experience, was somewhat rare. Usually, the marketing team wanted to come in and tell us what they were doing. This was a marketing team coming in saying, "What did you guys do? What are the salient things to pull out that we can show people in 15 seconds?" And that's the other thing that's tough about marketing. They had to make 15-second trailers, 30-second trailers, and 60-second trailers because they were used in different places for different reasons. If you think it's easy to make a 15-second trailer about a brand-new IP, it is not, and these guys figured out how to do that, so that was amazing.

So, you're probably watching this going, "What does this have to do with me making my games?" Well, as time has gone on in the industry, and there are so many games out there, discoverability is a huge, huge issue. There are so many games on Steam that if you think you're just gonna release your game and the accolades will will pour in because it's a good game, no, no. That just doesn't happen anymore. You may make the best game in the world, but if nobody knows about it, and they can't find it easily, no one's going to play it. So, I said before, and I'll repeat it, and I will repeat it in a harsh way so you guys hear it: It has never been easier to make games than right now because engines are free, there's art and code available for free, there are so many oral, you can watch. It's never been easier to make games than right now. In fact, I would go on to say, if you're not making a game, you don't want to. You just want to talk about making a game. You don't want to make one.

Having said that, because it is so easy to make games, people are making a ton of games, a ton of them. That means it's really hard for people to find your games. It's, you go on Steam, Epic, GOG, there are just so many games, and you try to reduce it to genre, and there's still so many games, and you try to say, "Well, show me just what came out in the last month." There are still so many games. So, this is where good marketing comes in. If you have a really good marketing campaign with really good people who got what your game was, what will happen is people will see the ads, and then they'll go to watch trailers or, you know, Steam let you buy a game and give it back in two hours if you didn't like it because our ads were very much like what the game was going to be. I don't think anybody felt like they were misled by our advertising campaign, which, which I've seen happen, where you see an ad for something, and you're like, "Oh, this is going to have a lot of choice or player agency or whatever," and you don't really have that. I think our marketing campaign was really good at pulling out the essence of Outer Worlds and giving it to people, and that made the Outer Worlds easy for people to hear about, to find, if they wanted to buy it. We had a lot of, um, streamers play our game, and people could watch that and see what it was like to play, which is really important.

It all boils down to the same thing, though. Really good marketing will get make your game more discoverable, which these days is more important than, I don't say it's not more important than making a good game, but those two things go hand in hand now. You have to make a really good game, and then you have to have really good marketing. In fact, for a lot of games, those budgets are equivalent, and I know a few games where the marketing budget was bigger than the development budget, and there's a reason for that. The number of games is not going down, and you have to compete with everyone else who's out there. So, what's a takeaway from this? If you're making a game, think about how you want to market it. Think about, and think about how you want that marketing to reach the people who you think are the most likely to buy your game because that's a really hard thing to do these days. And I think if you can find a really good marketing team, PR firm, they can really get you ahead. It costs money, yes, but I think it's money well spent. Anyway, hope that helps.

Hey everyone, it's me, Tim. Today I want to talk about why I got into MMOs, like why I even went to Carbine in the first place to make an MMO because a lot of people thought that this was a bit of a divergence from what I had done before, because I made mostly, at least since Fallout since '94, I'd done nothing but RPGs.

Well, I already talked in a previous video how much I really got into LP muds in grad school. I talked about Darker Realms, Snow Cows, and stunts I pulled as a wizard. That of course got me into MMOs when Troika started in '98. That's when EverQuest came out and EverQuest was pretty much a mud with graphics thrown on the front end. And I was having so much fun with that game. I would go home and play it every night. I had dozens of characters on multiple servers. The mode, the characters were most successful we got the highest level. I had a wizard named Mung Bean. And he got high enough when you were high enough you could throw a spell called gate which took your party and moved it to a new location but gate was very slow and in EverQuest if you got hit while you were casting spell got run. Well if you get high enough you get a near instant cast version not completely instant but pretty fast version of gate called evacuate. And in the fine print of the spell, it said not guaranteed to transport the entire party. And I'm like well you know what I'll cast it and you know fate to the wind. I was playing with a pickup group in the estate of unrest anybody remembers that place it was very unstable place to play you had to be careful how you pulled we were down in the basement scary down there. Someone pulled too much the leader turned to me and said Mung Bean your time to shine evacuate. Boom cast a spell bubbles appeared around everyone in the party except me. And then they all disappeared and then all the monsters turned and faced me while my message window filled up with other people in the party going we're at the evacuation point Mung Bean where are you. And of course I died and that's how I found out that the random party member or members who can be left behind included the caster.

I did play EverQuest a lot with my friends from Interplay. I stayed friends with a lot of people even though I was still at Troika and I wasn't allowed to go over there but we played EverQuest. We made a group called The Spicy Girls. So it was all five was Baby, Scary, Sporty, Posh, and Ginger. I remember Scotty played Ginger because he wanted the red hair. I was Posh and I was a Bard so I was the only member of the Spicy Girls who could play her own instruments. But because they allowed six people in EverQuest, Chris Taylor wanted to play and we made him manager. And we had a rule we'd be running around EverQuest if we ever heard anyone call for help or we saw someone about to be killed we would rush over and help them. So what these people saw was coming over the hill around the corner of the dungeon were the Spice Girls and they would dispatch the monster and then check the person was okay. We had a Healer, I think it was Baby Spice who was played by halfling, that was Jesse Reynolds, they would heal the person and they'd often say hey you do want to get a screenshot with us so you can tell the zone you can shout to the zone that the Spicy Girl saved you and he'd do it and then Chris Taylor would step in his manager and go I'm gonna have to charge you. I think some people gave us some money for doing that anyway so that was super fun.

So when Dark Age of Camelot came out I wanted to play that. Got another group together we were the Powerpuff Girls. I wanted to be Bubbles and I didn't get to be bubbles because it's Dark Age of Canada you could dye your armor and I was gonna make it baby blue and I was gonna be Bubbles but I logged in late. I had to be Blossom. But that was fun one of my friends called it Dork Age of Camelot she never caught anything the right way she was like Eric DeVille that way. But then Everquest 2 came out and again we were back to six party members so we made the Brady Bunch. And I remember we had a lot of fun with that. I was Jan, my I would always go Marcia, Marcia, Marcia. I played a necromancer because come on of the six Brady bunch of kids you know who would be a necromancer. It's gotta be Jan, there was a darkness to Jan.

That was about the time Troika went under, started Carbine. I thought it was great I get to make my an MMO note I thought this is wonderful life is great. Kept playing all these games I played WoW, but played WoW to death joined a guild. Had a Little Gnome Mage named Nugget, loved being a fire specialized Mage, fire spec so much fun although the later I became uh ice spec that was good too. There were some guys in the guild who were going to Disneyland I went to Disneyland that's where I met my future husband so did we meet in WoW did we meet in Disneyland well physically in person Disneyland. Moved on to City of Heroes where we all played we played a superhero team themed after Tim Gunn from Project Runway you had to make a character you need to make him look like Tim Gunn or Tim Gunn had to be in his name. I played a really strong guy named Tim Big Guns but I believe there was a 10 big guns who had two big guns. People saw a bunch of Tim guns running around fighting crime that was fun. Recently Star Wars Galaxies had its anniversary and I wrote RAF Coster one of the original designers thanked him for his work and basically told him about my character. I played Han Solo's cousin Pibo Pibo Solo. Without being a dashing rakish Rogue. Played DC heroes and I honestly can't remember a single thing about that game probably for I have to go to camp. Did Lord of the Rings and I brought back something I did in Temple of Element where I played an all Hobbit group because I wanted to test everything out. We made an all Hobbit group in that game you know started in the Shire I think and ran around.

I played some more MMOs after that I just I found MMOs to be interesting from both from a play point of view it was very social we could have as much comedy as we wanted no one had to take it seriously and then from a design level I really loved how it played with RPG tropes I mean it's an RPG but when you have multiple players it's a very different kind of RPG it's hard to make the world reactive because what player you're going to be reacting to. It was hard to make systems so yeah you had classes but the classes had to play a role which reminded me a lot of the pads in WildStar but the head of a role like you had to be a tank or a crowd control or a damage dealer. That was very different than what I was how I thought of roles in single player. So MMOs not only like scratch niche I had as a player but they were they just fascinated me from the point of

 view of design and I learned a lot of lessons playing all these games that I tried to uh bring to WildStar. And what was interesting was when I stopped playing or when I stopped working at Carbine I pretty much stopped playing those it was just part and parcel of all the same thing and I stopped playing it's fine other games came out multiplayer games I mean that's when I really got into Borderlands and some other online games. So that continued but pretty much my love affair with MMOs lasted from like 1998 to about 2011. and that's what that's 13 years that's a long time to just be in one genre and I just want to say that I really did like them you know why I got into them kind of know now why I left them but it made sense for that part of my career to be really into those.

Modding

Youtube Link:
https://youtu.be/LH4llMQmJ1E?si=mdq_UI5AS373-FqN

Hi everybody, it's me, Tim. Today I want to talk about modding. I get a lot of questions about modding: do I like mods, do I play with mods, will I review mods. So let me start off and say I love mods and I love when people mod my games. There's just so much to say about modding I had to write a list to make sure I covered it all.

By mods, I'm talking about anything from people making new levels or areas to add into games they play, or to people who change a system mechanic or add a system mechanic or modify the UI, or change what the skills or abilities do, or even add some, or even delete some. I love these things because, first of all, it's very creative and, second, it shows a kind of effort that goes above and beyond just, you know, critiquing games. Even if you're just telling your friends, "I like this game; I don't like this game," modding a game goes above and beyond.

And yes, we've hired people in the past, companies I've worked for have hired people who got their start modding. So when I say make a demo, that includes making a mod for a game you like.

Yes, I do play mods. I play mods in games I like. I like when there are mods available. But I will say this, the first time I play a game, I like to play it vanilla with no mods. I will play any patches that the company's put out because I've heard people go, "Oh no, you have to play the game the way it first came out." I wanted to play it the way the developer intended. Well, the developer probably didn't intend to have all those bugs, and the patches are developer intent. So I would definitely patch a game with the official patches from the developer. I wouldn't add the DLC though. I like to play that first game patched, no DLCs, no mods, just play it.

Later on, I'll add mods, and the mods I tend to add to games are ones that add new areas, new quests, and new NPCs. I less often play ones that change the base system mechanics or even move system mechanics because I'm like, now you're changing the fundamental foundation of the game. Like if I'm playing a game, what's a heavily modded game? Skyrim is heavily modded. I tend to lean towards the mods that add a new map or add new dungeons or add new NPCs that give you quests for things to go do. And I tend to avoid the one that go, "I've redone the entire magic system," or "I've changed how archery works." I'm less interested in those.

Now, I mean, I'm less interested in those as a player. If someone applied for a job and I said, "What do you have as previous work?" and like, "I do lots of mods," then that's interesting. If they go, "I've not only added areas to this game, I've changed the system mechanics because I felt like it needed more of this or I wanted to balance that," especially if that's relevant to what they're applying to. If they're a level designer, I want to see some areas you made. If you're a system designer, it would be really cool to see, like, "I took Fallout 3 and redid the skills." That would be an interesting thing to see.

Also, no, I'm not going to review the mods I use. I don't think that's not what I'm here for, and it's not what I want to do. And also, a mod I love or hate may not be a mod you love or hate, so it's not relevant to me. So that's why I don't do it.

Now, I've encouraged modding in all my games. In games I had a lot of control over, like Arcanum, we made sure that we could ship the tools for it: World Ed, the sector and map editor, and Sock Monkey, the scripting engine and script system script editor. We shipped those with Arcanum. And the reason we wanted to do that was we wanted people to make mods, and we convinced the publisher to allow us to do that because since they wanted multiplayer, we were like, well, multiplayer people are going to want new maps; they're going to want to make maps. So we got that put in, ostensibly to support multiplayer, but it was pretty easy to make single-player ones too.

So I love seeing my games modded. It's fun to see. While it's interesting to read reviews or game forums and have people go, "I wish they had done this," and "I would like it better if they did this," and "I didn't like this part," when someone mods a game, that gets like additional respect from me. And the reason is, first of all, it did mean they like the game, at least well enough that they thought some changes would make it better, or they liked it and wanted more of it, especially if they add more areas. It's usually, "I like it; I want more of it." But it also means they worked hard enough to learn how to mod it and then make those mods. There's a huge difference between somebody saying, "I wish the skills work this way," and a modder going, "I made the skills work this way." One is, "That's an interesting opinion; some people agree, some people disagree." The other one is, "Hm, let me take a look," because rather than argue over whether it's a better skill system, I can play it and see how it actually works and see how it interacts with the perks and leveling and other skills.

So I really respect modders for the fact that they actually did something. It's far harder to do something than to say something, and the internet's full of people who say things. I prefer doing. It's why I always say, I pay a lot more attention to what people do than what they say. People have said all kinds of things to me. I usually pay attention to their actions.

Now, I can't always prioritize making it easy to mod my games. As I mentioned with Arcanum, I had to convince the publisher. I'm not sure how much convincing it took when I mentioned that I was putting them in the build because we make the build. I said it was to support multiplayer, which is what they wanted. Can't always do that. We've often had publishers who pushed back when we were saying, "Oh, one of the things we're doing here is we're exposing these functions to scripts so that they can be modded." If we ever said that, they usually go, "Look, we're not paying you to make this game easy to mod. We're trying to pay you to finish this game," especially because you always come down at the end to you're running out of time. And especially in this era where if you're not going to crunch, that means you're going to delete stuff. You're going to delete skills, you're going to delete content, you're going to delete quests, you're going to delete NPCs. In the time period where you're deleting stuff in order to make your schedule, you can't prioritize adding in new stuff like

, "Hey, let's expose stuff to modders."

So, and we similarly, we can't always ship tools, and that comes with a variety of reasons. Part of it is sometimes the tools that you use are proprietary. Like if we buy a third-party tool to do lip syncing, we can't provide that tool with the game. We had to buy it, or and often now there's subscription, so we had to pay yearly to use it, so we can include it. But the game requires those lip sync files in order to have a person do their VO, so it makes it hard for the modder to make new dialogue. Similarly, you may make a tool that because there's teams are bigger now, some tools require networked resources. The best example I can think of this is at Obsidian, we use a string tool, and that string tool basically keeps text and keeps it in a big database for the game, keeps track of how many things are referencing it because sometimes you write one line of text, it'll get referenced in multiple places, keeps track of what languages it's going to be translated into, what language it has been translated into. And since different people use the string table for different reasons, it's kept separate from the game, and it's kept in a network location, so it's not on any one person's computer.

Well, it's hard to ship a tool like that because not only is it proprietary to the company, but it's the company's tool, so maybe they could decide to release it. But that would require you to have set up a network and do all this backend work just to let the tool work at home for you. Now, yeah, you could say, "Well, can't you make a version that's not networked?" It's not why we're doing it. And again, it's hard to justify that time when other people need tools on other games, and those games are being funded by publishers.

So that's why you sometimes see games that ship in a not easy to mod format. Some people like to ascribe it to those developers don't want their games modded. I think a better way of viewing it is modding was not prioritized either by the developer, the publisher, whoever held the purse strings. But I will tell you that a lot of games are now made on common engines: Unity, Unreal, Godot. So all those engines use a very similar data format. So once you learn one, and that's one of the reasons game engines get popular, once you learn one, you have the ability to make mods. Not all mods, but certain mods for all games made in that format. So that's another reason why you might want to pick up Unity or Unreal if you don't want to make your own game. Maybe you want to mod a game you like.

Now, I still like it when games ship with tools specifically to mod their games. But push comes to shove, learn a game engine and mod with that. So, to sum up, because so many people have asked, yes, I like mods, yes, I play with mods, yes, I love when people mod my games, yes, some of my games aren't as easy to mod as others. But a lot of people have asked these questions, so I hope I answered them all, and now you know what I think about modding.

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim, and today I want to talk about multiple Quest Solutions, and I want to use an example from Fallout that I used in my talk at the reboot conference in 2017, so that is rescuing Tandy from the Raiders. So this is the map it happens on, very simple map. I should point out one building, couple tents, sorry, it's shown here after killing some guards or some Raiders. The context here is you meet Tandy in Shady Sands when you first go there. When you go back to Shady Sands, she will have been kidnapped by Raiders, and Aradesh asks you to go, her dad asked you to go rescue her. The reason I always liked showing this particular Quest and its Solutions is it reminds me of my early GURPS role-playing where I'd make a very simple dungeon, but it would play very differently depending on the skills of the player characters who went through it. I talk about that in one of the Fallout videos about how GURPS influenced Fallout. So, let me walk you through this very simple map and all of the solutions that exist for rescuing Tandy. I'm going to number them in increasing order of complexity, and by complexity, I mean it's a combination of how hard it is for the player to figure out how to do this but also how hard it was for the developers to make that Quest solution, and that's really what I want to get at when I after I talk about all these.

So, the simplest way to rescue Tandy is just kill all the Khans, just go in there, kill them all, and get her out of the cell. It's straightforward. It's already supported by the game. You just kill all the NPCs. They're hostile to you anyway, and well, yeah, I think they're mostly hostile to you. I know you can talk to the leader, but anyway, I'll get to that. This is the simplest solution. It's pretty much the straightforward solution of almost any Quest, just kill everybody and take what you want.

There's another solution, number two, which was also pretty easy to figure out and also pretty easy to implement, which is you go around, you sneak, and you go around the back, you quietly kill the two guards at the rear of the building, and then you sneak in, and you have to pick the lock to get Tandy out of the cell she's in. Again, all of this is supported by the game systemically. Yes, you can kill those guards, and if you don't make a lot of noise, no one else will hear you, and then you can pick the lock on that cell if you have a pretty decent lockpick skill.

The third solution is similar, but I pull it apart from the second solution because it uses a different skill, which is you still kill those two guards at the back and sneak into the building from on the rear door, but if you don't have lockpick, you can use Dynamite on the cell door to blow it open. Now, there's no hard and fast rule of how to do this, but that explosive does make noise, so you should wait until anybody who's outside the building has moved away, any of them that are moving, so that there's less likely a chance they hear the noise and come investigate.

And then the fourth solution, you can go up to the leader, Garl, and enter dialogue, and I think if you don't have any of the skills I'm going to mention from now on, there's not a lot of options here, but if you have at least a 45 speech skill, you can intimidate him to get him just to release Tandy. So that's solution four.

Solution five, you can try to purchase her. That doesn't require speech skill, but you do have to have the money. So that's the first one was restricted by your speech skill, this solution five is restricted by you having money.

The sixth solution is you can tell Garl that you will fight him one-on-one in unarmed combat, and if you win, you get to take Tandy. Now, this is an interesting one because there's no restriction exactly, I think, on you being able to get this, but the only way to really do this, you're going to have to have a pretty decent unarmed skill, you probably want a pretty decent strength so the damage you do from unarmed is pretty high, and you probably need to be on a high enough level that you have enough hit points that you can take some hits from Garl. Garl is pretty strong, so that was solution six.

Solution seven, and the seventh solution that I know of to this scenario is, this is something that a scriptor added, it has a lot of preconditions. If you're a male character, and you have a Luck out of at least nine, and you're either wearing leather armor or you're using a stealth Boy when you talk, you can get by the guards, and then when you talk to Garl, there's a chance that he will think you're his dead father. Then you need at least, uh, there's a minimum intelligence, I think it's six, and it's a Charisma speech check. You can then, once Garl thinks you're his father, you can go with it, roll with it, and get him to release Tandy. So that's a lot of prerequisites. It's one of those solutions that when I discovered it, I'm like, okay, this can only really go in because we have the other ones. It is hard to find. I'm not, I would love to know if anybody figured this out on their own when they were playing, or if it was discovered later when they dug through the data files. And also, if I was to implement this one today, I'd probably say it works with a female character, and Garl thinks you're his mother. Because we had male-female divisions in the speech dialogue, in the dialogue files, so why not go with that?

Okay, here's what I think is interesting, though, about these seven solutions. The first three, completely systemic. And what I mean by that is, once you put in the building and the guards, set their factions, put Tandy in a room and marked it as locked, those three solutions required no additional code support, no scripting, no dialogue, nothing, they just worked. And that's one of the things that I think was successful in Fallout is right there, just with the way the code is written and skills were made, you have three solutions to a quest without anything special being done, boom. And one's combat, and the other two are stealth.

Now, the latter four solutions all needed scripting, and in particular, they're dialogue related. So whether you intimidate Garl with a speech skill, purchase Tandy with money, fight Garl in unarmed combat, or pretend to be his father, those all required associated dialogue. Short of using AI these days, I'm not sure how you can avoid this, but just so you know, the repeated dialogue subtrees that I saw in a lot of Fallout dialogues, things about asking money for something, trying to say an insult, I'm trying to think if there was another one, maybe asking to persuade someone or lie, these were things that encouraged me to make the generated dialogue in Arcanum,

 which I've talked about in another video. And the reason for this is two things: one, it felt like a complete waste of resources and time to remake all those dialogue subtrees, the text for them, the space they used in the dialogue files, the space they used in our localization files that we were localizing very similar strings, but they weren't identical. It's like, hey, I want to ask for money, hey, give me some money, oh sure, I'll accept a bribe, those variants that occurred, they were never written the same way twice, so we had all these places in the game where someone would ask you for money, and we had to localize all of them separately. The other thing that led to generated dialogue was all of those also required some scripts to control, to take the money from the player, to check that the player had enough money, and all the scriptors did it differently. Sometimes if you didn't have enough money, it wouldn't even offer the option, others let you ask for it but then the person would like, hey, you don't have enough money, the other person would ask, other people would script it so you could ask for it, they'd say okay, and then you would say, I don't have enough money, and the fact that they were done in the simple thing was done in all those different ways annoyed me because it made the game feel inconsistent.

So, what I loved about the multi-quest solutions in Fallout were two things: one, that a lot of them fell out systemically, and two, the ones that did require extra work were almost always dialogue, and that which let me, in Arcanum, to doing generated dialogue to help support just those things to make it easier and more consistent for narrative designers to include those things in the game, which then led to more Quest Solutions. The easier you make things, the more your designers and other developers will do more things. So, more tools mean more things.

Anyway, that's what I wanted to talk about today, is multiple Quest Solutions, how they pop out systemically, and the ones that don't, you can assist in how they're made. So, I hope that helps if you want to make multiple Quest Solutions in your own games.

My AD&D Mods.md

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim, and today I want to talk about modding the original Advanced Dungeons and Dragons. But before I go into that, let me just say that a lot of people ask me about modding and what I think of current mods and mods for different games. I love them. I've said I loved them. I'm not going to review them, but I've been playing and enjoying mods since probably back in the '90s with Quake and as recently as Fallout 4 the last time I played it. I did a playthrough, and then after I finished the main story arc, I loaded it with a bunch of mods just to see what people were doing with that game. Also, when I tell people, if you're thinking about getting a job in the game industry, you should make a demo. Modding an existing game is perfectly okay. If you have an idea for a cool new feature and you can take an existing game and just mod that feature in just to show off how it works and how it makes the game better, perfect. We hired someone for Outer Worlds based on a mod he made for Skyrim, so it happens. People pay attention to that stuff, and I can tell you that that guy's mod moved his resume to the top of the pile.

So, if you're thinking about modding, do it. But what I want to talk about today, because I'm going through all my stuff (people have asked me to go through it too, and they like hearing old stories from when I played AD&D a lot in high school, and college, and grad school, and a little bit at early Interplay), so that was about 20 years of playing AD&D, so I have a lot of stuff on it. This is one of my books. I told you my mom worked for the Judge Advocate General office. She came home one day with a few of these. This is the California Power and Light Company orientation manual for nuclear and fossil operations personnel. There was nothing inside, so I filled it with my campaign notes, and these are all the NPCs that my high school campaign hired, and then a bunch of other notes, which is what I want to talk about. But I've got another one that's full of all the dungeons that I made by hand because I didn't have a lot of money, so I ended up making a lot of dungeons by myself without having to go out and buy them.

But one thing I want to talk about was, I know with Basic D&D and with AD&D, they encouraged you to change things. I believe the beginning of the Dungeon Master's Guide, Gary Gygax even talks about while the general framework should be the same, individual DMs are free to pick and choose what they want to include. And in my campaign, we did a lot of that right at the beginning. We decided to go with the 4d6 generation method, which was an optional method from the DM's guide, and we didn't use the other ones. This is for attributes. We got rid of the weird restriction that women couldn't have higher than an 18/50. That was explained to me by my graduate student group that it was a dumb rule, and we got rid of it. There are some other things we got rid of, like we had a house rule that said if you rolled more than one attribute that was less than six, you could just roll the whole character, which kind of made sense because the rule said you had to be a particular class if you were under six, and you can't be two classes. I mean, I suppose you could make a multiclass, but it seems to imply you can't be any other class but that one.

Some of the things we threw away, like the grappling rules in the DM's guide, we just threw those away. They were complicated and nonsensical. And we also threw away, in the Player's Handbook, there's this big chart which is weapons versus base armor type, and it was an adjustment on the to-hit for weapons versus base armor types. We threw it away mainly because it was really hard to determine the base armor type of non-humanoid wearing armor. Like, if a lizard man is AC7, is that leather, or is that something else? If a dragon's AC zero, well, the base armor type only goes down to two, so what do you do with a zero? So we just threw all that out. But we also extended the game, and by "we," I should say, I started extending my own D&D campaign. I made additional rules. Some of them I made up. In fact, the first one I'm going to show you, I know I made this one up. Some of them, I think I either read in a magazine, probably Dragon, or saw on a module, and I copied it out. But when I copied it, I made changes, and now, 40 years later, I don't remember what my changes were, so I'm going to show them to you.

So let's go through the biggest four that I found in this California operations manual folder, and these are changes I made to my high school AD&D campaign. So here's the first one. These are called major malevolent, minor malevolent, neutral, minor benign, and major benign changes to your character. We did this for a while. What happened was when you made a character, you rolled percentile dice. You can see at the top if you rolled under 95, nothing happened. If you rolled a 96 to 99, you rolled once on this table, and if you rolled double zeros, you rolled twice. Now, if you rolled under 40, you got something bad, and if you rolled over 75, you got something good. Of course, everybody wanted the good stuff. It was things like regeneration and ultravision and infravision and really cool stuff. But the bad stuff was really bad, like being deaf or blind or losing points on your attributes. We made this. Now, keep in mind, this predates me ever seeing GURPS by at least a decade, but this is basically GURPS advantages and disadvantages, just a poorly thought-out version because there's, you know, who knows what you're going to get, and you get no bonus for getting a penalty, and you get no penalty for getting a bonus, so it's really unbalanced. People loved it if they happened to get a really good benign one. They hated it if they got something bad. They'd often ask to reroll or something, and I made them play. I think we ended up stopping using this when my friend William made a character, and he rolled double zeros, which means he had to roll twice. He literally rolled two major malevolent things. His character was blind and had hemophilia. What that meant was he couldn't see, and if he ever got hit with an impaling or cutting damage weapon, he would bleed until he was fully healed. Guess what? He wanted to reroll. I wouldn't let him. His character died in the first battle, and he didn't even try to live. He was like, "This is a dumb character. I'm getting rid of it." So, this wasn't really a pretty smart thing to do, but we used it for a while, and it was interesting. It was fun. Maybe this is the

 origin. Maybe I should call this the origin of flaws. Maybe I should have brought this up when I talked about the evolution of flaws, but this, to me, is kind of like my first thing of chewing on advantages and disadvantages, perks, and flaws in D&D when I was 14 years old.

Another thing I did, this is a major modification, and we kept this one. Everybody loved this one. When you made a character, you had to pick a god, and I had all the gods, and I had them all. I had a big chart for, depending on your class and alignment, here are the gods you could worship. Also, there was a subtable for if you were a particular race. Here were some additional gods, like the Elven gods could be worshiped by elves of any class or alignment, and then there were even some NPC-like, here's what sailors tend to worship, here's who sages tend to worship. But what I did special for clerics, and this was really popular, and this is well before D&D version 3 introduced something like this, every deity granted an ability and a restriction to their clerics. So, for example, if you were a cleric of Astore, your ability was one undetectable lie and one phantasmal force per day. So once per day, you could just say, "I'm going to lie," and no spell would detect it, and the person would believe it, and one time per day, you could cast a phantasmal force as if you were throwing the spell, the magic spell. But the restriction was, every time you went up a level, there was a 5% chance per level you became a pathological liar. Once that happened, you always lied. You lied about everything. You never ever told the truth. Interesting character adjustments. Aura, which is the one right after Astore, this was the one that was most popular because one of my long-running characters, or players, had a character who was a cleric of Aura, and their ability was they could see through illusions and disguises with the same chance is a thief of the same level pickpocketing minus the disguiser level, and two clerics would also communicate two sentences of 25 words or less with no range as long as one of them knows the other's general whereabouts. That was super powerful, but the restriction was they had to hide their temples with great care in every country except Vendia, which was the country of their origin, and they also had to burn any waste products coming off of them, including their hair. So that was a huge restriction, and I kept my friend Joel's cleric. He had to follow these restrictions, and that was hard. You know, you're in a dungeon, you have to make sure that anything that comes off you can't just discard something. You had to keep it to destroy it later. He was the player who eventually kept a pit of green slime in the bottom of his temple in the basement, and he'd just go throw things in there at the end of the day. So, what I loved about this is it made clerics more interesting, and it made the characters that the clerics were more interesting, and we used this throughout my entire campaign run.

One of the things I should have mentioned when I did the economy video was I actually experimented with economy measures in my original D&D campaign in order to keep money in check. I think I found this in a magazine. I honestly don't remember, but this was an addition. In D&D, you had to pay money to go up a level. It was 1,500 gold times the level you were going from. So if you were second level and you're going up to third, it would cost you 3,000 gold to go up a level. What I did here was there was basically taxes and duties on things. So if you brought goods into a city, you had to pay 1% at the gate, or if they were luxury goods, 5%, and that's if you were a citizen of that country. If you were in another country, it was more. We had an entry fee into the town based on heads and wheels. So if you were riding a cart with a donkey pulling it, that's two heads and four wheels. There was an annual tax that was levied on people. There were sales taxes on anything you sold in it. So maybe you had to pay a duty to bring it into the city and then a sales tax when you sold it. Property taxes on buying stuff. Religious tithe for services, meaning you had to pay 10 gold per month, plus you had to attend church. If you didn't, they would not give you services like cures and resurrection. There was a foreign currency exchange. Gems and jewelry had a much higher sales tax. If you had a guild, it cost 100 gold per level per month, but that usually paid off well because fighters' guilds gave you access to mercenaries cheap, you know, that you could hire. Thieves Guild gave you access to a black market goods vendor and lockpick sale, and then there was a toll road use. We used this for a bit of my campaign, and it did keep the money in check. It was just really hard to keep track of. I mean, in a computer game, this would be one thing, but doing this by hand, we just got tired of it really fast.

The last big one I think I changed was I redid the falling damage in D&D. It was really a d6 per 10 feet you fell past the first 10 feet. I thought that was a little normal, a little generic, so for a while, we used this falling chart. Again, I think that I got this out of Dragon, but I don't know. It basically is to roll percentile dice, and you might take less damage, excuse me, per 10 ft. You might do the standard d6, but you might take even more, d8, d10, d12. There was also chances of sprains and breaking something, which would then require either rest, which remember would cost money. You know, you have to go to an inn and rest for a month, or you'd have to go to a temple and get a cure, and it better be a temple you're tithing at, or they're not going to do it. So these were all things I put in my campaign. I think this one eventually we got rid of too because it was a little... It was a form of realism that wasn't fun, and I have a whole video about that. So we eventually got rid of it. But the whole point of this is I played AD&D for a while unchanged, and then after a few months, we started doing our own mods. I think that makes sense for any game, and I think if you're a game developer, you probably should do that. I don't know a lot of people play board games without some house rules. Everybody had Monopoly house rules when they were kids. You start with house rules on board games, go into your favorite video game, and mod it. It's a great way of exploring your ideas with a very low barrier to entry, other than learning how to mod, but the engine's there, the art's there. It's a great way of you exploring your own

 ideas.

So that's kind of the theme of this video, but I also wanted to talk about mods I tried to do in AD&D when I was 14 years old. Anyway, hope you liked that, and I'll see you tomorrow.

My Bad Game Development Skills.md
Youtube Link:
https://youtu.be/v6a-neSq0VA?si=xqH3s9Uuj-lEsD3e

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim. Today I want to talk about game development tasks that I'm bad at. So I thought I'd talk about those game development skills that have that have eluded me over many decades and that I finally resolved myself to you're not going to learn these, you're not going to get better at these, it's better to let someone else do it. So let me talk about that.

So first of all, I think the biggest thing when I look back at my games, it's adding or editing, paring away features. If there's one problem I always have, it's I want too many system mechanics in one game. I just, when I start thinking, it's like I want this, I want this, this one makes sense, but only if you have this one to balance it, we need more of this. There's hey, I'm worried about this kind of character being made and not being supported, so we need to add this, this, and this. In every one of my games, it adds up to too many system mechanics. I think Arcanum was probably the ultimate expression of that where if there was an idea that anybody had, it went into Arcanum and Arcanum just had everything. I mean it had, uh, you picked races and attributes and skills and backgrounds, and there was magic and Tech and Companions and summoned companions, just if we had an idea, it went in there. But it wasn't just that, like Temple of Elemental Evil was a good example of when I told them I didn't think we should do paladins and bards and maybe Druids because they were just, it was, they were two specialized of classes, and Atari pushed back and said no we need to have them. I should have said that's not something you're getting in 18 months. It's the problem we had with temple was 14 people should not have been making a game, or actually I think it was only a dozen, a game of that magnitude, of that scope, something had to give, and what gave was story and, uh, just total play time, and then we shipped with a lot of bugs, and that's all another thing, but basically, it should have been cut back. And that's true on Minimate games, they should have been scoped back. Our worlds, I think, was correctly scoped back, and I remember even before we shipped, people on the team were like, "People are going to complain the game is too short." And I remember saying, "If that's what we get, that's the complaint we get on this game, that it's too short, I'll take that. I'll take that over, it's massively buggy, it crashes all the time, it's imbalanced, um, it's not fun, whatever."

So I think that's the first thing I'm bad at. The second thing I'm mad at, which touches on that first one, is balancing game systems. So not only do I add too many in, I end up not balancing them. Backgrounds, traits, perks, skills, magic spells, the now, I was the first one to say I care more about fun than balance, but there were just times where I didn't balance well enough, and it we ended up with things like in Arcanum that harm spell was just the best spell, was that everybody takes it. In Fallout, that nobody liked the gambling skill, wasn't worthwhile, and there were some perks that just don't bother taking these, they don't, they're not powerful enough, or we had a level cap of 20, but we gave you two perks at level 18. Have fun playing those for two levels. There were just things like that on all my game, that when I my games, that when I look back, I'm like, why did I do that, why didn't I change that, and the answer is always the same. When you're prioritizing bug lists, balance never gets a high priority for me. I go after crash bugs, I go after you can't finish the game with this build, it either dies all the time when it gets to this level, or you end up needing to check skills that this particular build will never have. I look for things like the main story can't be completed by a certain build. So yeah, there's there's things like that that just always prioritize on my list way above balance.

The third thing I'm bad at is writing dialogue. I used to say writing, but now I say writing dialogue, and because here's what took me a long time to learn. My first few games, uh, grandstand Bridge Bard's tail, construction set, Rags to Riches, I didn't write anything. There's I don't think there's a single line I wrote in that game, in any of those games. In Fallout, there are requests I suggested that somebody else wrote, but then I wrote the Cinema, opening cinematic, and that got so much praise that I'm like, I must be a natural writer. No, I was not. With when Arcanum rolled around, I didn't have time to do writing. I basically made huge lists of quests, suggested quests, and how they would play out, but I didn't do any of them. That's why when a lot of you ask quest questions about Arcanum, I don't have the answer. Let's I deferred to Leonard in both of those chats to answer questions about the quests. The but when I got to Temple, well Leonard and Jason and Chad Moore and Sharon showman, they were all over on vampire, and they wrote good dialogue and quests, so I thought I'll do it. So I wrote a lot of the dialogue, well, I'm with Tom Decker on Temple, and these weren't very good. Mine were not very good at all. However, I have learned that I can do lore text. I did a lot of it in our world. I'm good at that, short things. I can write cinematic narration, not conversation, not character development. A narrator doesn't have a character, he doesn't have a personality. So I'm good at that, but I'm not good at conversation, character building, writing. So I've learned to be precise, and like, I can do some narrative design, but not all.

And then the last thing that I'm really bad at, contract negotiation, and that's something I learned at Troika, but then realized later I was bad at it even for my own personal negotiation. But let's talk about Troika. So on the very first contract for Arcanum, we used a lawyer, and he caught a lot of things, but even then there were things he and all of the three of us, Leonard, Jason, I missed. The biggest one for Arcanum was digital rights, they're not included. It specifically says it's for physical boxed Goods that are being sold, so I, I know it excludes things like digital sales, but I think it also excludes if there's ever like if Arcanum plushies had come out, we wouldn't have gotten anything from that, and that was bad. We did include it, we're smart enough to include it in the next ones, but the problem was we were negotiating both Temple and art, and vampire contracts why things were

 still happening, you know, we were still doing patches on Arcanum after we had those new contracts. That's when we realized that the Arcanum contract, and now the temple and vampire contracts, did not include our right to make unofficial patches. So all three of those games, the same thing happened. Once the publisher had paid for a few patches, they didn't want to make any more patches, and on all three, we're like, great, we're doing our own patches, no. And we're like, we're making unofficial, no. And we were told we literally were not legally allowed to make patches, which is super frustrating and super annoying, but the worst part is, you have fans telling us how we've abandoned our own games. Oh, by the way, you're often not allowed to talk about contracts when you're under them, because I don't know, rights. The one thing I wish I had added, the one line I wish I had added to all of those contracts, well, I probably couldn't get it for temple, vampire, but definitely for Arcanum, was IP reversion for non-use. You basically throw in a line that says if you end up not using this IP for five years, and maybe you let them negotiate you have to test the 10 years, then we get it back. What's great about that is if they say nope, we're not gonna do that, we're like, well, look at it this way, if you're, if it makes a lot of money and you're using it, we can't use it. But if you don't use it for that period of time, we get it, but what's a loss to you, you're not using it, you're literally not using it. It's the same thing, um, I had a friend negotiate a contract, he was working on as an employee, and he said he didn't want to travel, and they're like, well, we can't, uh, guarantee, but we're almost positive you're not going to be traveling in this role, so we added a line, and he said, if I travel, you have to pay for a first-class ticket for me. And they were like, we're not going to pay that, he goes, you just told me I wouldn't be traveling, so this Clause will never get activated. So they agreed. He traveled twice his first year at that company, and what was funny is they had to pay first class, and they were mad about it, but he's like, you effectively lied to my face, and now you're mad that you're the one paying for the lie, and that's what I wish I had done. I wish I'd had put in more Clauses that were, this Clause will do nothing bad for you unless what you're telling me right now isn't true, in which case kicks in, because they don't want to admit they're lying to you, so often they'll agree to that conditional clause, and then when the conditional happens, too bad. But guess what, I was terrible at that. I was also terrible with that for my own contracts. I never managed to negotiate royalty when I was at carbine, or bonus for sales or whatever, for WildStar, even though other people there did, and I knew about it. And when I asked for it, they're like, at that point, I should have just left at that point, but I'm just really bad at personal negotiation, and you know what, I know I've talked for 10 minutes, but I'm gonna throw in two bonus things. These are Game Dev activities that I'm good at, but I hate doing.

The first one was HR. I was the human resources person at Troika for the last couple of years. Sharon did it at the beginning, but eventually, uh, she left Troika to be a stay at home mom, they had three children, uh, Sharon is Jason Anderson's husband, great artist, did great HR. I took over. I was good at it, and I hated every moment of it, the paperwork for hiring, the paperwork for insurance, state and federal paperwork and reports, oh my goodness. I don't even want to start because I was that person. I don't even want to start on the paperwork I had to do to shut Troika down. Troika was started by literally signing a piece of paper and paying a filing fee, boom, company exists. Shutting it down, nightmare, about eight months of work, multiple state and federal paperwork and reports, things that rules that contradicted each other, one rule that said I had to do A, the other one said I had to do B, and A and B were exclusive, my programmer brain exploded.

Then the other thing that I was good at and hated doing was accounting. I was basically, although maybe that I shouldn't call myself that, maybe I should told myself troika's bookkeeper, but again, for the last couple of years after Sharon left, I did all the bookkeeping and bill paying at Troika. That's why I was, between those two things, HR and accounting, is why I wasn't full-time on vampire, so that meant I bills would come in, I'd confirm them, because occasionally companies will send you a bill that isn't really a bill. You didn't order this, you didn't ask for this service, they're just billing you for it and hoping your pay. So I pay their legitimate bills, sometimes you have to look at a bill and go, that's not due for another three weeks, and we don't, we get a big payment coming in a week, I'm gonna put it off, you had to juggle stuff like that at a small company. I also did the QuickBooks, which we would then send to our accountant, who would make sure that everything was good, and he complimented them at one point on how everything was accurate to the penny and categorically correct that I was putting expenses in the right categories, it helped him out a great deal, and I'm like, I'm good at this, and then he'd leave from that meeting, and I'm like, and I hate, hate doing it. I hated it, every time something came up, and I knew the next hour or two hours or all the rest of the day, I'd be doing something with our books, I was just like, I just deflated a little bit, another reason I didn't want to run a company. And by the way, I know there were a lot of comments, people, why didn't you hire a business person, with what, what, we didn't have any spare money. I, the first year or two, Leonard, Jason, and I had to pay each other like half salaries, we had no money to hire a business person. Now you might go, well, you'd hire a business person, then you get more money, that's true, but it's a catch-22, do we, how do we hire a business person with money we don't have to then maybe get money that we could use to pay for a business person. Anyway, uh, here's my bottom line with this, you know what, it's okay not to be good at everything, and it's okay to not like doing things that you're good at. The Secret of

 all this is, you have to find the intersection of things you like doing, things you're good at doing, and things that people will pay you to do. If you can do that, you're golden. For me, luckily, that was actually rolling up my sleeves and making games, either programming or design. I like doing it, I think I'm good at it, people will pay me to do it, it's a happy intersection. Find that intersection for yourself, you can be happy too. So good luck.

My Biggest Lesson.md

https://youtu.be/GqNcNtxHU6E?si=C4ttOyHc3D2Kbsmh

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim. Today, I want to answer a question about lessons. Zamala asks, wondering what Tim's self-editing answer with some background because I want to talk about working with teams, and this isn't what you think it's going to be. I actually like working with teams, and I think that goes back to I loved I know I started playing D and D in high school; that was fun. I worked with teams in even in elementary school. I talked about in one video trying to do a New York Times crossword puzzle for a whole week in a reading class. Project Classes I like that. Then I went to engineering school, where you're put on project classes. It's just part of the curriculum, so you learn how to do that. I know a lot of people, especially in high school and college, when you're assigned to project classes and you're given a team, it can be a miserable experience because there are some people out there that just really try to slide by and do nothing. But let me tell you something, that's no different when you go to a company. You're going to encounter that. So, but let me tell you, in hindsight, after decades of working in game development, I think I liked working with the people more than I actually liked the games that we made. And bear in mind, I really, really like those games. It's just, I have all these memories of being in a team and working together, working really hard, working long hours, but you create something, and it's amazing. There's really no other feeling like that, and if you haven't experienced that, I hope someday you do, especially if the thing you're creating involves something creative. It's just, you make something that's bigger than any one of you that no one of you could have made. So, of course, it means all of you were needed. It's just an amazing thing.

But here's the lesson I want to point out, and it was the hardest lesson for me to learn, and I will tell you what I've been told repeatedly by people I work with in the industry, that I am naive and optimistic because I keep learning this lesson and then I relearn it and relearn it and relearn it. And the lesson is simply this, two words: people lie. People lie all the time. People will lie right to your face. They look right, look you right in the eye with a smile on their face, and tell a complete fabrication. Or worse, I've met people who find a way to lie to you where they're not stating anything that's provably false but it leads you to a conclusion that is false. So later on, they go, "Why didn't actually tell you that. If you believed it from everything I said that led up to that, that's your fault." So, I've learned, sometimes ask questions like, "So, do you mean X?" Even then, there're sometimes lie to you, especially if someone won't send you something in an email but will only tell you verbally, they're probably lying.

But let me put a spin on this that makes it even more complex because I always like to talk about nuance. There's a lot of people I've met who lie to themselves. They lie to themselves about things. So when they're talking to you, they're not really lying to you. They've lied to themselves. They believe the thing they're telling you is true. So they're only lying to you by proxy. They've lied to themselves. They believe this thing to be truth, and so what they're telling you is a truth. They don't even know they lying because they believe it. And let me give you some examples because people always go, "Well, I don't know what you're talking about." And I know some of you are like, "Oh, you're just, you know, defending employers, or you're going to bag on employees." No, I've seen this lie at every level. I've watched my co-workers lie. I watched my employers lie, and I've watched my employees lie.

One of the biggest lies I get is, "I'm on top of this. Yep, I'm doing this. Yep, it'll be done on time. Yep, I'm well along; it's going to be done." People have said this to me to my face who haven't even started it. They haven't even begun, whether it's a design or code or art. They haven't even done the very first line or pixel or word. Sometimes I have discovered this because in the era of perforce and, you know, manage check-ins, I can actually go to someone and go, "You say you've started this, but I see no check-ins for you for the last month," and they're like, "Uh, well, I'm, I'm doing research." I'm like, "Show me your research." "I don't have it; it's in here." That's tough. Um, you know, you want to believe them, but after a while, I've that "trust but verify" phrase means more and more to me.

I've also had people say to me that they're, they're going to finish the project we're on, but then they want to look for something else, and they have really good reasons. Sometimes they need more money. Sometimes they want to move. Sometimes they're like, "Hey, I came here to work on this thing, but I'm not interested in the other projects coming in the pipe, so I'm going to leave after it's done." In every case, they looked right at me, or I watched them say this to their boss if I was like in another project, and then guess what, they left anyway. And in all the cases I'm talking about, it's not because the game took longer than expected, not because of schedules changed. They pretty much lied about staying. In one case, it was because they wanted their name to go in the credits, um, so that they could use that credit, which they knew was coming out, to say, "I was in this role on this game. I'm," and they parlayed that into a better job.

In one case, I watched somebody say they, they were looking for another job, receive from their company a counteroffer, meeting and exceeding what they're getting from the other place. They asked for it in writing. They then took it to the other place and got a better offer and quit anyway. And by the way, I'm not saying don't do this, but it's like everything, it's like when people say, "I have free speech." You do, but there's also consequences to it. If people don't believe you anymore after this, that's a consequence to it. If you look someone in the eye and go, "I promise I'll stay," and then you leave 3 weeks later...

One of the worst ones I've heard, usually from employees, is, "No one's going to get fired over this," and then someone's fired. I've had it happen where we were doing some test uh project tests. We were trying to do levels in different ways, so we assigned different groups of people, and we gave them very different ways of putting a level together. We gave them different

 um assets, we gave them different a different team mix, and we gave them different goals, and I was said, told this was done as an experiment, "No one's going to get fired over this. We just want to see the best way to do things." And I'm like, "This is great. Never worked anywhere that ever did something like this." They did it. There was one team that was a very clear winner. Irony, they didn't use that team, but they then had me fire someone, saying, "Well, now that we know how to put together, we, this this person, we don't really need them. He's redundant. He doesn't have the skills we need." And I even said, "You said to my face nobody would get fired," and they basically ordered me. I had to go fire this person. That was such a low point in my career that after I did it, I felt so crappy about it that I went to my boss, and I said, "I'm never going to do that again. The next time something like that happens, you do it, and if you order me to do it, and there's no other question, I will quit on the spot. Would you like that in writing?" We had a big argument over it, where he said, "You know, you were the technically that person's boss, and that's your job." And I'm like, "No, cuz I wasn't going to fire him."

The worst part that happened is there was someone who was doing, I thought, a pretty good job, but my boss wanted him fired. He didn't like his work. I did; my boss didn't. After I left that company, that person, um, that employee was told I was the one who wanted him fired, and that it was my boss who saved his job. And I think he did that because after I left, he realized that guy really did do good work, and he really wanted to keep him. And I was like, by the way, I could do a whole video on how willing people are to accept lies. I mean, forget all the people who tell them. There's a lot of people just go, "Yes, your lie coincides with what I believe, so I'm not even going to try to verify it. I believe you with absolutely no evidence." That has happened time and time and time again. And I've been told, "Tim, you're naive. This keeps happening to you. Why do you keep believing it's not going to happen again?" And it's just because I'm optimistic, and that's been a very hard lesson for me to learn. I've learned that over and over, people lie. Not just employers, not just employees, not just people on your peer level, everybody lies, and they always find reasons to do it, and they always feel validated for why they did it.

So, I know that's negative, but you might want to just always keep that in mind. Like I said, trust but verify. Ask for things in writing. Now, ironically, I'm not going to talk about what I find to be the most fulfilling thing about game development, and that is the creating, not the creation. I love making an IP, a new IP from scratch. I love that. That's my favorite thing. Fallout was super fun. Arcanum was super fun. Wild Star was super fun. Pillars t as little as I was involved in both of those, and then Outer Worlds to a huge extent. Those were all super fun to make from scratch. Loved it. But then there's a reason I think I move on after each game and not as interested in the sequels because to me, the most amazing part was just done. And that, to me, I think is the most fulfilling experience for me, is making a new IP with a group of people. It is intense, but that collaboration is incredibly gratifying, especially like I said, you will make something that you never would have made on your own, and in many cases couldn't have made on your own. Whether it's someone else had a better idea than yours, and you slotted it into the game, or someone had the technical or artistic skills to realize an idea you had that you never would have been able to do on your own, or if just in the middle of a wonderful brainstorming session, an idea comes out, and afterwards, there's no one person you can point to and say, "That was their idea." It was just this collection of people talked, and this idea emerged like from the ether. Those have been amazing. I've done crazy joint code debugging sessions that decades later, I still remember, combing through the code, finding the most egregious bug, and fixing it, and then suddenly your game is 10 frames per second faster, or doesn't crash, or, you know, just some feature suddenly works that was completely disconnected. Those are great experiences. So whether, and also making system cool system mechanics or making cool content on Fallout and Arcanum, those experiences were just incredibly fulfilling. They were wide in scope. The intenseness of doing it, that is probably what I remember the most and what always brings me back to game development, is you always want to recapture that, and it's happened on every game of mine, but I think it happened most frequently on Fallout, probably because it was my first game I was in charge of, and it happened on Arcanum, probably for me, the deepest and most intense because I mentioned in other places Leonard handled most of the publisher, so I was completely focused on the game.

So it's funny that working in teams is the source of the hardest lesson I've ever had to learn, that people will lie to you, but also the most fulfilling game dev experiences that I've ever had, which is making something amazing that exceeds any individual's contribution. Wow, that was a long answer. I hope, Zamala, that that answers your question, and I hope everyone else enjoyed the story time.

My Colorblindness and Games.md
Youtube Link:
https://youtu.be/fHUAFYDzN3U?si=XvGz4JdFBaPOcAnb

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim. Today I want to talk to you about color blindness, and specifically my color blindness, which is a weird one, the weird form of it. I want to talk to you about exactly what my color blindness is and then I want to talk about how it's affected how I play games and make games.

So I have a form of colorblindness. I think the total description is adult onset Progressive full spectrum color blindness. What this means is I had full color vision when I was a child and as a teenager, but starting when I was 20, I missed one of those Ishihara color plates you probably have seen them at the optometrist. There's a bunch of little bubbles and they spell out a one two or three digit number, and you have to tell the optometrist the number you see. I've taken those several times, I always got all the numbers. They just do it really fast I think to see if you have macular degeneration because one of the first indications of macular degeneration is color loss.

Well, when I was 20, I was in college. I wanted contacts. I didn't want to wear glasses anymore, and my optometrist, who had used all throughout my life, he said, "Well, let's just knock out some plates," and he puts them out and the first one, I didn't see a number in it, and I thought he was kidding. I was like, "This is one of those test ones right, that doesn't have a number?" He goes, "No, there's a number in it," and he looked on my chart and he said, "You saw that number five years ago." I couldn't see the number. He did the entire 38 set, and that was the only one I couldn't see. So, he noted it, I got my contacts.

A few years later, I moved out to California to go to grad school. After a year there, it's really dry, and I was like, "I can't wear contacts here," so I got glasses again, had new optometrist, she gave me the test, I missed three. I was like, "Wait a minute," and she was worried she was always regeneration, she did all the other tests for it, no macular degeneration, but I was like, "Well I used to see them, all of them, and two years ago I missed one." So she said, "Let's keep an eye on it." I don't think I went back the next year. I think it was two years later, I missed five. This isn't good. By this time I was 24.

The next year, I bailed on grad school and went to Interplay, and that was the first time I really had a problem. Interplay was making a new game called Out of This World, and for copy protection, they used a color wheel. The way it worked was a symbol appeared on the screen, you had to rotate an inner wheel to that symbol, and then say pick the symbol that was on the outer wheel from a selection it provided. Most of the symbols were pastel colored, and that's important, pastel. They made it pastel because a black and white copier wouldn't help you at all, and a lot of color copiers in the 90s really didn't reproduce pastels correctly, so they figured people couldn't make photocopies of this for their friends. But I was losing pastel, pastels were the colors I was losing first. So I got a copy of it, and I wanted to play it, and I tried three times to get my copy protection and I failed every time. So I ran downstairs and told the executive producer, "We can't ship the game with this copy protection, colorblind people like me can't do it," and he thought I was lying, which is funny because one time I had laryngitis and one of the producers thought I was lying. He said, "I think you're just you just don't want to talk." I was like, "Have you met me?" Anyway, I convinced him I couldn't see it. I think they still shipped with it. Sorry, colorblind people.

What was interesting is every year or two when I got new, I went to the optometrist to see if my prescription changed, I asked them to do it, to test me with the Ishihara plates, Ishihara, and it was getting worse and worse and worse and worse. Just so you know, two years ago, and I'm in my 50s now, so I loved being 54, 55. I missed 26 of the 38. In fact, the optometrists like, "Okay, yeah, you're not doing well." We just played plate, plate and occasion, I go, "Wait, that's a 37." I don't match. I'm not really red-green, I'm not really blue-yellow, it's across the spectrum. For some reason, I'm holding on to my blues longer. I've lost a lot of reds and greens. There's reds and greens that I remember but don't see. Deep, deep blue, I still have that, but like, unless the sky is a rich azure, it usually looks Battleship Gray to me. I bought a brown shirt, turns out it was green. Years ago, I was at Disneyland, I bought a tan shirt, it was orange. Why would Disneyland make an orange shirt? I don't know.

A few years ago, when I was still at Obsidian, I was explaining this to the company-wide art director, Rob Nestler, who by the way was also the 3D art director at Interplay when we made Fallout, and he was trying to grasp how I saw the world, and I was trying to describe it as sepia but not quite like watercolor. So what I did was I took a picture of, and I'm going to show it to you guys, I took a picture of some fruit arranged in apparently a spectrum, and I put it in Photoshop, and I desaturated it, I moved the desaturation bar just until I saw it change, and then I moved it back up to where I couldn't see it, and I showed him a side by side. I said, "These two pictures look the same to me." I'm going to show them to you now. So for me, both sides of this picture look exactly the same, except maybe the left side is a little brighter, but pretty much look the same. This made the art director sad. He said, "Wow, you really don't see color well." And I said, "Yeah, imagine being in my shoes and trying to pick out a bunch of bananas. It's like, I'd bring home green bananas all the time."

And when everybody was playing Skyrim and saying, "This is so monochromatic," I was like, "Welcome to my world," because I think Skyrim looks great, and I think the color palette is just as rich as a lot of other games I play, which let me tell you about playing, playing games for me is rough sometimes. When we were making WildStar at Carbine, the art director liked making creatures that blended into the background, and for me, it was really hard to see them

. But he said, "Well, that's what they should look like because they evolved in nature," and like, "But we're not trying to make this game realistic, we're trying to make it fun." When I came to Obsidian, they were making a game in Armored Warfare, tank game. I tried playing it, and I kept shooting my friends because friendly fire was on, because I couldn't tell the difference between the green outlines and the red outlines. This has been going on for me now, probably starting about 15 or 20 years ago, it was really hard for me to play some games. If you played World of Warcraft, it was years before they put a colorblindness mode in the crafting, so that next to the recipe names, it'd be like a plus or a plus plus or a plus plus, depending on what level of difficulty it was for me. Once they weren't gray, they pretty much all looked like the same difficulty, so I couldn't tell whether a crafting recipe was going to get me give me points or not, make my crafting go up.

When we made Fallout, I was somehow in charge of the palette, but I did it all with RGBs, and there's a story once of, I know I've told it somewhere, where I had to approach Leonard Boyarsky, the art director, and say, "Hey, there's some colors here you're not using, so you better use them or I'm gonna take them and put them on other things." Well, it was all the blues and yellows. He said, "No, no, I'm saving those. That's going to be the player's starting suit because we hadn't made the Vault suit yet." And sure enough, that's where the Vault suit came from. It used blue and yellow, those two ramps, which he deliberately wasn't using in other things, so the player would pop when you saw them on the screen.

Well, when we were making The Outer Worlds, I wanted to make sure that I could play this game, and since normal colorblindness settings don't work for me, when they say, "Oh, are you there's like chromaticy, there's hope, there's like red-green colorblind, some blue-yellow," those don't work for me often. They, I click them in this, it becomes hideous colors, and I'm like, "I can see the difference, but everything looks vomit-inducing." So what I did was, and this is for Glenn and Chris, our UI artists, that are UI designer, I had them do all the initial UIs for The Outer Worlds in grayscale. You could use anything you wanted, as long as it was gray. And they would put it in, and they would show them to me, and sometimes even put them in the game that way, and I could play the game. Then they could add color to it because at that point, you know, you can change the color as long as you don't change the HSV space, the value, I'm fine. So they made all the UIs that way, so I could easily see when you know my health was getting low, the color would change, or icons were different colors and shapes, because you could see it in grayscale, it meant I could definitely see it, but it also meant that worked for everyone, regardless of whether what kind of colorblindness they were because if I can see it, anyone who's colorblind can see it. So that turned into the UIs that we shipped with, so we didn't need a colorblindness setting because there was just there was no need for it.

To this day, when I play games, I will occasionally buy a game, and I'm having a lot of trouble playing it because red-green is like game developers' favorite, like enemy and friendly, or you know, "Oh, your health bar is getting low, it's turning from green to red." I can't see that, and either can a lot of other colorblind people. It's frustrating, but people are gradually getting better, and we're also getting better at adjusting font sizes and doing subtitles, just so that everybody can play the game, and that makes sense. By the way, we wanted bigger fonts, but we were having trouble doing them, which is why we added them, we had font sizes in The Outer Worlds, and then expanded it later after we shipped.

So now, I'm 57, it seems to have roughly stabilized at about half of my color vision is half of the Ishihara plates are missing, which means a good spectrum of the world just looks plain to me. Interestingly, my brothers and sisters have all developed the same color blindness, although they did it much later than 20. We're not sure why I developed it so early. One optometrist I had theorized it's because I use computers a lot, and that makes people color desaturate. It's why if you use a brightly colored monitor and you look away, sometimes things look desaturated. My mother started losing her color vision in her 50s, and her father, my grandfather, he was always colorblind as large as anyone could remember, and as far as he could remember. So if he developed it, he developed it early on. He might have even been born with it, but that's the line it comes from. There's a mutation on my maternal line that generates this in men and women, which of course makes it a really bizarre color blindness because most colorblind people are men because it's some, it's a defect on X. Since men have a Y, there's nothing to correct it, where women can only be colorblind if they have the same defect on both X.

So it's a strange thing. It is a disability, but it's not something anyone can see, but it still affects, you know, I dress myself, I drive, I know I can see the lights, but sometimes if I can, at night, and it's, I, you know, I look and it's the top one that's lit, boom. Went to Austin once, was it Austin or Dallas? I was in Texas, and the lights were on their side, and I was slowing down as I approached the intersection, going, "Is left stop or is right stop?" and the car next to me went through it, and I was driving, going, "Left mean stop, left mean stop, okay, I know how to drive here." Those are the kind of things I deal with. I was at the grocery store, and I run the card, and the cashier will say, "Press the green button to accept," and I'm like, "Could you tell me what button?" is it. One time, a cashier is like, "The green one, I told you, the green one." I'm like, "I'm colorblind, use your words and tell me." She goes, "Bottom right." There we go. So it doesn't happen very often that it like impacts my life, but when it does, it does it in a very frustrating way, and so I've been trying to make all of my games in a way that I don't want any colorblind people or anybody who's has vision or hearing problems to have any kind of impact on how they see this, they experience the game. And that's why I'm really

 glad Microsoft has a lot of really cool accessibility options too, for controllers, so a wide spectrum of people with different disabilities can still play, and the games are accessible, and I think that's great because I'm one of them. Anyway, now you know. Thanks.

My Development Preferences.md

https://youtu.be/gj60AoeWvAE?si=yJnnIM9LkphA2bUA

Hey everyone, it's me, Tim. Today, I want to talk about my development preferences. So, I've already talked about what I think what elements of a game make it an RPG for me, and I've also talked about what I think makes a good game, in other words, the metrics you can measure a game by for you to decide whether it's a good game. You can go watch those videos. This one is more about what I consider to be my own preferences in one of the games I'm making. Part of the reason I'm doing this is I've had people ask questions where they seem to be assuming that I want something in a game that isn't necessarily what I want. One of them was, "Well, don't you like complicated system mechanics?" and I'm like, "I've made a lot of games with complicated system mechanics, and I've made games with simpler mechanics. I don't necessarily have a preference, but I know a lot of people do." So, what I'm going to talk here, you can view this talk as what makes a Tim Kaine game. I'm going to talk about those things I prefer if someone said to me tomorrow, "Make a game." This is the immediate way I start leaning whenever I make a game.

So, first of all, I like making RPGs, duh, that's pretty obvious from the games I made. I've made non-RPGs, but I like playing tabletop RPGs. It's what I grew up doing. I like role-playing games, and I like making them. For any one of my games though, you know that I'm also really big into reactivity and specifically player agency, player choice, and consequence for those choices. I want the player to be able to do what they want, and then I want the game to have consequences for that. This is why I got upset once when someone said, "I can't believe your game let me kill a child." I'm like, "My game didn't make you do it. It just allows it." And the fact that you know it's possible means you're a bad person, and there's really bad consequences for doing it. I never really wanted a strict player agency because someone says, "Well, that's a bad thing to do." Of course, it's a bad thing to do, and the game tells you it's a bad thing to do, and after you do it, bad things happen to your player character. I don't want to restrict choice because then I have to start restricting consequence, and then that induces a morality. It imposes immorality on the player, which is getting my next point, which is, I love gray morality games. I like games that don't necessarily say you're going to be a good person, or you're the background, you're the sheriff of this town, and you have to uphold the law. I don't want to make a game like that because I don't want to play a game like that. I prefer to let the player choose whether he wants to be good or evil and then live with that. Now, I've had to, you know, make allowances when I'm making IPs that aren't mine. So, when I made my DND game, alignment was something that was built into the system. Yeah, I could have yanked it out, but it's kind of baked into D&D, at least it was at that point. It felt like an odd thing to pull out. For the same reason, I don't want to make a real-time D&D game. I felt like the whole game was designed to be turn-based. Leave it alone.

Which gets me into my next preference, given my choice, is given my druthers, I would rather make an original IP, then make a game in someone else's IP. Now, I've broken that rule a number of times. I made Barstow Construction Set. I made Temple of Elemental Evil, you know, I made a South Park game. But I can say that if I had a choice, I would have rather have made an original IP because, first of all, I've got so many ideas that why would I spend time implementing someone else's? D&D meant something to me, and Vampire was already started up by my co-workers, so I worked on that. But if it's my own personal choice, I want to work on an original IP, my own original IP. That said, I had a ton of fun working on Pillars of Eternity, which was Josh's original IP, and Tyranny, which Chris Avellone started, and I really like exploring an original IP with the IP creators right there so I can ask them questions and go, "Okay, if I understand it, this will happen, and these will be consequences." So, I like that. So, I guess what I'm saying is, if I'm not the original IP creator, I prefer for them to be sitting right next to me, and it'd be a real-time creation that we're involved in.

This kind of goes into my preference for not making sequels. I've never been one for making sequels. Even when Fallout shipped, even before Fallout shipped, I was telling my bosses, "I don't really want to work on Fallout 2." I know a lot of you are like, "Oh, how could you not want to do that?" Well, I was great. A lot of you knew it was great. I just wanted to work on something else. I had worked on Fallout for three and a half years. I had other ideas. I had ideas that didn't fit into Fallout. People on the team had ideas that didn't fit into Fallout. I think after you've spent a number of years in something, you've kind of earned the right to work on something else. Now, I admire people who make one game IP for a decade or two of their career. That's hardcore. It's not me. I would rather make a new game than keep working on sequels of a particular game I've made.

Similarly, I prefer to make a game that has humor in it. I've tried to add humor into every game I've ever done. Some of my games are a little less humorous than others, but I like putting humor in a game because I think overall, games should be fun. I've stated multiple times I prefer fun over balance. Now, and I've said, don't forget that I said, an imbalanced game isn't fun. If it's way in balance, it's not fun. But I think it's okay for some character classes or some player builds to be more powerful or less powerful than others. That's part of the challenge. It's fun.

Similar or related to that, I think, on games I make, I want the player to make his own character. I hate handing a character to a player. When I have to, I try to make that character as generic as possible. So, for Fallout, when you get voted out of the Vault, the reason I wanted that voting out is because they just wanted anybody to get kicked out of the Vault. You know, if you make the super dumb character, you may go, you know, "Why is why would that be the person they send out to save them?" No, they voted them out. They just wanted them out of the Vault. They

'd wait two weeks and then send someone else out. When you played Outer Worlds, and you were a frozen colonist in the opening cinematic, it shows Phineas going through different people, and he was rushed. The ship started getting attacked, so he just grabbed someone and ran. That's what I loved about it. That left the background of that character up to the player.

Which gets me into settings. So, remember, I told you I always go setting, story, system mechanics. So, let's talk about the three of those and what my preferences are. Just like I like making new white original IP, and I don't like making sequels, I like making different settings. I don't want to stay in one setting too long. It kind of wears out its welcome to me. So, every time I've made a new game, I've tried to change the setting, and I always want to have a twist in there. It doesn't have to be an M. Night Shyamalan twist, but I like my twists. So, Fallout was post-apoc, you know, like Wasteland was, like other games had been, but our twist was it was retro futurism. It was the future that the 1950s thought would happen. That had a cool twist. Arcanum, yeah, it was a standard fantasy, very Lord of the Rings-esque fantasy game, but it was undergoing an industrial age. Hmm, all kinds of scenarios pop out in my head about that: quests and characters and stories. The game room I was making at Carbine for WildStar, it was science fiction with spellcasters. That was very different than Arcanum. Arcanum wasn't science fiction. Arcanum was fantasy getting into an industrial age. WildStar was pretty strongly science fiction. Oh, but there were spellcasters. Magic worked. And then with Outer Worlds, we said, "Okay, we're going to do a pure science fiction, hard science fiction, but let's make it dystopian. Let's make it colonies that corporations have set up." In fact, I often talked on the team that this was a pre-apocalyptic setting. That if we could jump forward 100 to 200 years, there's probably going to be something apocalyptic happening, if not on the colonies, then widespread Earth and the colonies.

Which gives me the stories. I prefer stories that are non-linear, of course. The games I make, I like to say that because I want player agency. I want the player to be able to choose the path they take on the story, so the story has to be able to adapt to that. Which gets me to the second thing I like about my story is that they're player-driven. When my narrative designers like, "I have this story, and it'll be like, it'll hit beats A, B, and C," I'm like, "I always get concerned right there and go, 'Wait a minute, what if the player doesn't do B? What if the player doesn't even go to the location that has B?'" So, that gets back to non-linearity, but also, it means that the non-linearity is driven by the player. It's not driven by an external agency. I want the story to react to the player, not force the player to react to the story, and I think that's an important distinction.

And then finally, when I made mechanics, I always wanted something unique in them. I never wanted to ship a game where somebody said, "I've seen all that before." So, for Fallout, we had a lot of new stuff in that. I mean, I think Fallout was the first CRPG to use anything like perks. I mean, correct me if I'm wrong, but having a huge number of fairly disconnected bonuses that you could just pick from in a pool when you went up level, I don't think any computer game had done that. And the dumb dialogue, I don't recall seeing in any game before Fallout, and I've seen them in other games since, so I knew we were onto something. Similarly, Arcanum had fate points, which were the things you got for doing major quests, these points that you could then spend to force die rolls to be a certain way. You could force a critical, you could force a full heal, you could force an enemy to critically fail. I like stuff like that. I like that sense of the player's got this incredible power he can't use too many times, but he's got it there waiting to use. Similarly, the whole Magic-Tech balance in Arcanum, I thought, was a really interesting feature that wasn't just talked about in the story, and you know, you had characters talking about, "Oh, God, the elves are getting upset at the rise of tech. The, you know, tech people are like, 'Okay, elves, it's not your time anymore, and the dwarves are gone, so it's human time.'" I like that, but we also, it was reflected directly in your player character with that Magic-Tech meter that would go up and down, and you couldn't be full magic in full Tech. It was like a continuum. On Temple of Elemental Evil, I was a little more restricted on what new ideas I could bring to it because it was D&D, and I didn't want to make it not D&D. However, I did introduce the idea of party alignment, which was, well, if you're forced to pick alignment for characters, party alignment was what restricted your party from having too many disparate characters. It's like, I couldn't understand why a paladin and an assassin would be in the same party. So, I came up with the end of party alignment where you picked a party alignment, and everyone alignment had to be one step from that. And then from there, that jumping-off point, that gave us the opening vignettes, which were based on party alignment, which we had had time to do more with those vignettes. I really wanted them to be a couple of hours each, but I thought that was an interesting addition to D&D. In WildStar, we had the whole path system, which wasn't the class. The class was the game telling you how you could play. Paths were you telling the game how you like to play, which was things like, "I like exploring. I like killing. I like classifying everything I run into. I like socializing." Those were paths that were right out of Richard Bartle's book on MMOs, but I'd never seen that put in a computer game before. And lastly, with Outer Worlds, I had been thinking ever since Fallout for two decades, I've been trying to figure out how to put disadvantages, which I saw in GURPS and really liked, into a computer game. You know, why would people pick them? In GURPS, it was you got points back at character creation, but I wanted to have more reactivity with the world. And since Fallout, achievements had started becoming bigger and bigger in computer games, and achievements require the computer game to track everything the player is doing. And I thought flaws were an interesting way of reflecting back to the player, "Hey, I saw what you did there," or, "I saw what happened." So, if you get, you know, if you're constantly

 taking lots of damage or being critically hit by robots, it makes sense to go, "You want to be robophobic. You want to be scared of robots. You have a lot of good reasons to be scared." And I like that, and I'm hoping that's something that will be a jumping-off point. I hope I see that in other games, or similar kind of mechanics ideas behind things. You can make a game more reactive to what the player is doing. I hope I see that in other games because I want to play that.

So, I think that's a big chunk of my development preferences, and I think if you put all of those together, that's what I think a Tim Kaine game is. And notice, there's a whole bunch of things I didn't say because I don't think they're as important. I don't necessarily need complicated system mechanics. I don't need 80-hour games. I don't need a game that ends when the story's over. I'm fine with an open-ended game, but as long as the consequences are there for the player. So, there's a lot of things I've heard people say, "Oh, I bet Tim liked this." No, some people are right, some aren't. Oddly, people seem to have no idea of how right or wrong they are. They're just very confident that's what I want. But I think everything I listed here will give you a good idea of what I think a Tim Kaine game is. Not that you asked directly, but I think this answers a lot of questions I've seen in my YouTube comments. So, I hope I answered one of your questions if you're watching this.

My First Professional Game.md

https://youtu.be/3nLc-pULEhw?si=hNPeku4GCsOPReS2

Hi, it's me, Tim. Today I want to talk about the first professional game that I ever worked on. I had fun yesterday talking about how to get a job in the industry, and I said how I got my job, but this is the first game I worked on that shipped, and it wasn't why I got hired. I got hired at a company in 1981, and that, by the way, was when I was still in high school. My first purchase of parachute pants was still a couple of years in the future, and I wish I was kidding. I basically worked at this company doing tools for artists because the Atari 800 had really good graphics modes, and that's why I was hired. But a couple of years after I started, they decided to make a bridge game. Bridge, the card game.

Now, it's interesting, they also changed their name about this time. I got hired in 1981 at Pegasus Software, but they didn't do a copyright search, and that name was already in use, so about a year, year and a half later, it switched to Cybron. See, I told you naming is hard. So, they told me I'd come back to work full-time in the summer, it was either the summer between high school and college or my first summer back from college, I don't really remember. I didn't take a lot of notes then. I really started taking notes, um, my next game, because graduate school burns into you to take notes. But I was just a high school student; I thought I'd remember everything because it was also exciting.

So, I came to work for a summer, and they said, "We're going to make a bridge game." The first thing I thought is, "I don't play bridge. I don't know how to play bridge. I've never played bridge." But they had hired someone, Nathan Schneiderman, who was a good bridge player. He couldn't code. So, what he did is he wrote down the rules for bidding, and by the way, like 99% of bridge is just bidding. He wrote down rules and flow charts, and then I would convert those flow charts into C. The funny thing is, they were using C even though they didn't really know C, and I'd learned C and Pascal in high school and then used it extensively in college, so I really knew C well.

Also, the entire game was being done in text graphics, which I will show you in a second. So, I remember sitting down with the lead programmer, Fred Klein, and talking about things you could do in C, like I got to enumerations where you could actually use words instead of numbers, so you didn't have to say if your card was 51, you could say if card.suit equals spade, and card.rank equals Jack. You could put those in enumerations. Fred loved enumerations. Then I showed him recursion. Fred did not like recursion. I walked him through why you'd use it and also why you wouldn't. It wasn't a "here's a hammer, make everything into a nail" situation, but he wasn't super happy with that.

But I remember what happened was, I would play the game. I think after that summer, when I came back for winter break, I was playing the game, and it was really slow to shuffle the deck. Like one time, I thought the game had hung because it was like three or four seconds, which is an eternity. You know, you said "new deck," and it used to sit there, you're like, "What's happening?" So, I looked, and the algorithm he was using was literally, he had two arrays, right there, that's pretty bad, but he would pull card. I'd pick a card at random out of the first array and then put it in the first slot, then he'd pick another card at random to put in the second slot, but if he picked one that had already been picked, he had to pick again, which means as that algorithm went along and most of the slots in this array were empty, he'd be picking slots were empty over and over again, and the algorithm took longer and longer run. By the way, there is a chance, it is non-zero, that that algorithm will never finish. I told Fred this, and he was like, "No, it's fine, people didn't wait a few seconds," and I was like, "What if we use the Fisher-Yates Shuffle?" Something I'd learned, and there was a Twist on it, I can't remember the name of the twist, but it used one array, it was O(n), which meant it just went through the array once, and so in other words, it was not only guaranteed to end, it would end a lot faster than the other one. These shuffles were now near-instant. So, he really loved that.

So, let me show you. The game came out in 1986, and this was the cover, and I thought that was pretty cool, you know, and also Electronic Arts published it. I mean, how huge was that? I mean, Electronic Arts was big even back in the '80s, although for me, it made me think of, uh, there was a basketball game they made, Larry Bird versus Dr. J, which I thought was amazing because when you dribbled and threw the basket, and it broke the glass of the backboard, and low res, but still, in the '80s, everything was amazing. So, I thought that was cool. I was like, "Hey, I have a game has shipped by Electronic Arts, now we're still in college."

Oh, and let me show you the game too, because it was all done in text graphics that looked like this. These are all done with character ASCII characters. It looked pretty good for the time, and it was fast because it was a text mode, but now it looks kind of, you know, a little rough and ready. So, anyway, that was it, shipped in '86. I came back the next summer, in 1987, and I was supposed to work for them, but I think they were out of business; they were gone. And so, then I tried to get another job, um, through another friend, making a compiler, which I thought was really exciting. That fell through, and my mom, who's awesome, let's establish, she was awesome, she said, "You know, you are finishing college, and you're about to go to grad school. Why don't you just take the summer off and do nothing? It'll be your last summer to do nothing." So, I didn't do anything. Did bother me, though, that before they disappeared, that the guys at Cybron never sent me a copy of the game, but I didn't really think about it. I would, I saw a review of it in, uh, I might have been Computer Game Strategy Plus, this is a long time ago, and it would, it reviewed well, and I'm like, "This is great." So, I went to graduate school, I got a master's degree in two years, actually a year and a half, and then a couple of years later, I was in my Ph.D., and for various reasons, whenever I'd

 go into, I decided, "I don't want to do this anymore."

So, I set my resume around, and it got picked up, um, a local company, Interplay, asked me to come in and do an interview, and in the interview, I was all excited because they wanted me to work on a Bard's Tale game, and I'm like, "Yeah." The guy I was talking to, Tom Decker, who would later on be my producer there for various titles and was the original producer on Fallout, he asked me a question about my resume. He said, "You said you worked on Bard's Tale," or "You said you worked on Grand Slam Bridge for Electronic Arts." I'm like, "I did," and I started telling him some stuff I did, and he goes, "Now, wait a minute." Here's, he had, he reached up and pulled off a shelf a copy of the game. He goes, "This is the manual." I said, "Oh, I've never seen this," and he goes, "Look at the credits." And I went, my name wasn't there. Not programmed by, not additional programming by, not even thanks to, and what was weird is another programmer was missing. There was another programmer who worked on it besides Fred, and his name was missing too. Mad, in fact. Tom told me later, when I was an employee at Interplay, that he originally thought I was lying to try to get the job, but when he saw how mad I got about my name not being there, and also the stories I had told about what I had done and what it had been like to work at that company, he was like, "I believe you." By the way, I found out later that was pretty much par for the course. Credits have been contentious for the last 40 years in this industry. There are some companies that if you don't stay to the very end, they drop your name off the credits, which I think it's not illegal, but I do think that's unethical. My rule was always if you were there for majority of the time, or up to the end, or you contributed a major asset to the game, whether it's Code, art, design, you went in the main section, programmed by, art by, designed by. If not, you still went in the credits, but it was additional programming by, additional art by, additional design by, and my only exceptions were if you were only there for a short time and nothing you did ended up in the final game. Okay, you know, if you were there for two months and the game took three years to make, and none of your code made it in, I can see not putting your name in, but, you know, usually I did, it's additional programming by. I was nothing in that.

So, I was mad, but I did end up getting that contract job, which turned into Bard's Tale Construction Set, which then turned into an employment job doing Rags to Riches, so everything was good. But I thought that was cool, it was my first experience with the industry. In hindsight, I learned a ton of lessons that you would think I would have put to use, but those came later, things about being told things would be done quickly, and they weren't. I mean, this is a bridge game, I thought it'd be done in a few months, it took three years. Uh, not having my name in the credits, having a lead that discounted everything you said until you actually proved that what you were saying was right, optimization nightmares. There's a lot of things that happened on this game that were a microcosm for things to come. But anyway, that was my first experience in the game industry, was not my last, and I will see if I can find a picture of me in parachute pants, but I don't think any exists, luckily. Have a good day.
Title:
My Lost Decade.md
Youtube Link:
https://youtu.be/7ZyK9V9Q-xY?si=XgMSxjZrGfWIhbnO

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim. Today I want to talk about my lost decade, which is what I call 1993 to 2003, and I think this is a pretty appropriate thing to talk about after I've talked about my whole work-life balance slash passion thoughts. Some people know this, some people don't, but pretty much from the end of making *Rags to Riches*, which came out in '93, to almost the end of making *Temple of Elemental Evil*, which came out in 2003, I didn't do anything except work on video games. Many of you may think, okay, he's exaggerating. No, I pretty much worked every weekday, probably for about 10 hours, until we probably before the team started crunching. I always felt like I can't ask people to crunch, let me try to get some stuff done. So, starting about three to six months before I even think about asking anyone to put in extra time, I was working probably 10 to 12 hours a day, and Saturday. So, by the time crunch came around, I'd be working 12 to 14 hours a day, every day, which meant I'll talk about what that meant in terms of my life, but what you have to remember is that meant I didn't see any current movies for that entire 10-year period from '93 to 2003, no current movies, no current music, no current TV shows, at Interplay unless I did something at the Thursday night thing, that game night I told you about. I didn't do anything. So, we might have someone might have brought in a movie for us to watch or a TV show. I know we watched a lot of *ReBoot*, but if it wasn't there, I didn't watch it at home. I don't even think I had cable for most of that time because why would I have it? I'm not really home to watch it. Once I got to Troika, once I started Troika in '98, nothing. So, that means from '98 to 2003, for about five years, nothing. The closest I ever got to socializing was occasionally going out to lunch, but even then, I didn't do that every day, and sometimes maybe only once or twice in a month.

So, let me kind of put in perspective what changed from my point of view. Music, I talk about like the number ones, music went from Whitney Houston to 50 Cent. In fact, funny story, while we were making *Arcanum*, Jesse Reynolds, one of the programmers, mentioned Britney Spears, and I, in pure honest innocence, looked up and said, "Is that a new weapon in the game?" He just looked at me and said, "Hey, you need to get out more." I explain to me Britney Spears was. I think we watched, uh, one of her videos, um... God, I'm gonna Brita out here. I love *Community*. "Hit me with your Genie bottle," I forget, it was, um, the one where she's dancing around in classrooms anyway. Movies, the number one movie went from *Aladdin* in '93 to the final *Lord of the Rings* movie, *Return of the King*, in 2003. Huge range. Number one TV show went from being *60 Minutes* to *CSI*.

Now, I did play games in that period. I played a lot of games. I would often go home and play, oh gosh, pretty much most of the RPGs that came out in that time period, I played. I liked puzzle games, especially I keep my Links by in the bedroom nightstand. I'd play like *Chips Challenge* and stuff. I used to play a game called *Sherlock* on the PC, really got hugely into *EverQuest* as soon as it came out in '98, was into that game hard for three years. I'm talking, I had characters I soloed, I had characters that I played in groups. I told you about some of them, totally forgot to talk about the necro Squad where he made six necromancers that just grouped up. Evan told us it was a mistake to put that many of the same class in one group, but we rocked that game. We would do things way over our level because we just send in pets. The pet died, five other pets kept it busy until the sixth one made another pet. We went through a lot of bones, but a necro Squad in original *EverQuest* was very effective.

So, I've often had to tell people, you have to imagine what life is like when you're completely and 100% obsessed into your job. So, for a big chunk of, I go weeks, and if I was crunching, maybe months on end with never seeing my home in the daylight. I just, I'd leave when it was dark. I would get home when it was dark. I often, about, you know, once a week would, as soon as I got home, I just start a load of laundry. Then I maybe grab something to eat, maybe sit down and watch an episode of *Simpsons* or something. I would then switch the laundry into the dryer and just pass out and go to sleep, knowing that in the morning I could go downstairs and just grab everything clean out of the dryer. And I would do that sometimes for months. I would go shopping. I found a grocery store near me that was open 24 hours, every day of the week. That was amazing, and I'd go shopping at 2 A.M. Now, if you've ever gone shopping at 2 A.M., you know that it's an interesting collection of people, a lot of high people, a lot of drunk people, and then people like me who are, who people thought I worked a swing shift. But I got to know some of the people who did the grocery because they'd see me there once a week at two in the morning. I went for months without ever seeing the deli or the butcher shop open because those aren't open 24/7. I believe there was a pharmacy too, always closed, little Coffee Cafe, always closed.

My mom came to visit once, and I came home, and she had this really good fried chicken. I'm like, "Where'd you get this?" She goes, "Your grocery store." Like, "They don't sell this." Turns out they did, they sold rotisserie chicken and fried chicken, freshly made, but not at two in the morning. In fact, it was so bad towards the end of *Fallout* in '97 that my neighbors thought I had moved because they literally never saw me, and at night there wouldn't be lights on in my house. In fact, I ended up, when they told me that, I went out and bought timers to make my lamps come on in the living room and the bedroom for certain periods in the evening. And of course, when I told him I hadn't moved, it turns out I got the nickname in my neighborhood of the hermit because people thought, well, he lives there, but we never ever see him. They, I mean, they never saw me, so I'm not surprised.

It was a weird 10-year period. Just recently, I

 saw an interview with Donald Glover, and it's probably about four years old, but he talked about being raised in a very religious household, and he wasn't allowed to watch television or see movies or listen to the radio or most music. And he was on Stephen Colbert, and Colbert asked him, "How did this affect you when you got older?" And he said, well, when he discovered those things as an adult, they fascinated him in a way that people his age, people in their 20s, weren't fascinated by. They had gotten over all that in their childhood. And I related to that because there were many things when I started living again in 2003 that just amazed me. I mean, I had my first cell phone. I probably got a cell phone in the late '90s and just used it for work. That was when you paid a lot for roaming minutes. By 2003, it was what everybody used everything for. People were texting, you could even send pictures, although sometimes you only got a link, and you had to go look it up on a browser. It was interesting. It was wild. The world had changed in 10 years, and instead of feeling like I was in my 30s, part of me felt like I was so stuck back in my 20s.

What ended this was, while finishing up *Temple*, should say finishing, last six months, which for me was already crunch time, I was like, "This has to end. I can't keep doing this. I'm in my 30s. I see that this kind of mode of living can't continue." And I decided to date. I didn't know anybody. I hadn't, you know, even been out in the world for 10 years, so I went on Match.com and met an architect who was good-looking and funny and smart. And we started doing all these things. We went out to eat dinner in really nice restaurants. I went to some charity events with them. I have a talk. I had a tux. I ended up traveling a lot, which I didn't think I liked. I thought I hated traveling, based on basically how I used to travel when I was younger. He knew all the wonderful things about traveling and getting upgrades and using lounges at airports and going to really fun places. We went to France. We went to Hawaii. We went to South Korea. It was fun. It was eye-opening. In fact, when Troika shut down, I was in South Korea, working on a theme park with that architect when I got a call from Eric de Milt, who had worked with an Interplay. He was the producer on *Fallout 2*. If I wanted to come to Carbine, so that was interesting. I had to tell them I was in South Korea, and he goes, "Oh, the home office is there. You should just go by there." And I'm like, "No, I'm here working on a theme park."

So, I look back at all this, and I go, was it worth it? You know, do I regret losing those 10 years? No. Was it worth it? I don't know. I do think work-life balance is important, and I guarantee you, I did not have it, even before and after that 10-year period, but that 10-year period, no one can argue that my work-life balance was way out of whack. But I also made some of my most popular games, the cult classics, and I don't regret those, and I don't want those to not exist. But it was rough coming out of that decade. There are things you're just supposed to know in your 30s that I didn't know. And to this day, I found myself frequently still learning things. Like, especially since I started in the game history at 16, I never, you know, did standard teenager jobs like work at a retail store or fast food place, so there's just things I don't know. There's experiences I don't have. And similarly, there are experiences that people have in their 20s and early 30s that I don't have. So, there's a disconnect in a bit between me and other people on that. It has gone away as I've gotten older, but I noticed it really the most when I was first coming out of this lost decade. I wouldn't recommend it, but I certainly don't regret it, if that makes any sense whatsoever. So, whenever I talk about my lost decade, that's what I'm referring to.

My Time With MUDs (Multi User Dungeons).md

https://youtu.be/-lerxozozis?si=OBrCdTwtsi3VBOrK

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim. While I have a whole list of topics I want to talk about, and the list is getting longer, today I want to jump to the topic of MUD history. I spent all day yesterday thinking about MUDs, so I just moved it to the top of the queue. For those of you who don't know, MUD stands for Multi-User Dungeon. It was something that started decades ago, I want to say early 80s. It was a text-based multiplayer game, think Zork or any Infocom game, very similar. You know, a description of a room, things you see, you can type in text responses like pick up sword or attack monster, but other people were playing as well. Usually, I think they topped out at a few dozen, but I know later on it was hundreds if not thousands. So you could be standing in a room and suddenly it would say, "Look, Bob enters the room," and you're like, "Say hello Bob," and Bob would be like, "Let's go adventure."

And yes, there were puzzles in MUDs that required more than one person, which is what sparked my mind about wanting to do this. So, in the late 80s, it was either late '88 or early 1989, I've been at UCI for a couple of years, University of California Irvine. I had my masters, I was working on my PhD, and I discovered MUDs. There were a few online, and this is back when the internet was called ARPANET, and pretty much the only thing you could get to were other universities. There were a few MUDs online, and I'd go in and play with them. Finally, a friend of mine and I, we made our own. We didn't make it, he grabbed a modem. It's called LP MUD, Lars Penske had made a version of MUD, packaged up pretty easy to grab and use. So we made an LP MUD, it was called Wintermute. I believe that's after a character in the second Amber quintet, the ones about Merlin, not about Corwin. It came with a default area like a default village with a pub and a church and a general store and a jail, kind of just generic, and a few extra areas.

The way it worked was, you were a player, and then when you hit Level 20, you could get promoted to Wizard, and then a wizard could actually make new areas by coding them in a very C-like language, which is perfect because I knew C. So we played around in Wintermute. I got to level 20, got promoted to wizard, my character's name was Fred. It was very interesting because later on, in Fallout, my assistant producer was named Fred. And you're given an inflatable castle that you put somewhere in the world, and it explodes, and then you have to design it. So I made Castle Fred hay atop Fred Mountain. Even then, I'm super good at naming things. And I filled it with all kinds of fun stuff. There was a whole set of dungeons under it, some of the dungeons led to other dimensions. I made a copy of Fred mountain and Castle Fred and put an evil Fred in there. And many players who went through thought it was me because it didn't say evil Fred, it just said Fred, but he was evil, and he would attack them. And then they were running around yelling, "The wizard Fred is attacking me!" because you can shout to the whole Zone.

Interestingly, I made a post-apocalyptic world, and it wasn't accessible like the other dimensions were through a gate in the dungeons of Castle Fred. The way it worked was I made a nuclear weapon, a bomb you could find, but if you pressed the button, it said this is already activatable in the Town Square. So you'd have to go back to the town square, and what I did is I made an entire duplicate of the starting zone, but all the descriptions were changed to make it look post-apocalyptic. So the pub was burned, and the church was in ruins, and the jail, you know, all the bars were melted.

And what would happen was, people would find this bomb, try to make it go off, and said you have to be in the Town Square. They go to Town Square, and they'd blow up, and it would give them, you know, you a huge explosion, mushroom cloud, miraculously you survived. But they'd look around, in the town squares and ruins, and the villagers ruins, and inevitably they would shout to the zone, "I'm sorry I destroyed the starting Village," and everybody would laugh and tell them they were actually in another area.

Ronco Psychomatic, the other fun item I remember making, which is important to the story I want to tell, is the Ronco monster suck-o-matic. This is a little device, it could be set to suck or spew. The way it worked is if you went up to a monster, and before it started attacking, you could say suck monster, and it would put it into the Ronco psychomatic, and you could look at it in there through a little window. It could only hold one, so once you would sucked in a monster, you couldn't do any more. You could take it somewhere and hit change the setting to spew, and the monster would come out and would be angry, and the first thing would do is attack you and everybody else in the room. So of course, players started finding the worst monsters in the game. Another wizard had made a Terminator, it walked around his Zone saying, "Are you Sarah Connor?" and then shooting you. People would suck the Terminator in, go back to the pub in the main starting zone, and spew them out. Yes, it would attack the person, but it also attacked all the newbies that were in there, and it was like hahaha. They put dragons in there and all kinds of things. Finally, um, I made it so it obeyed properties of the room, so you could make rooms that the Ronco psychomatic wouldn't work in, and then it would say it's jammed or something, it doesn't work.

This is why that's important. So we played with Wintermute for about six months. We lost interest in it, but there were two wizards in our world who were coming in from a Texas University, I think it was Texas A&M, and they were really good, and they started their own LP MUD called Darker Realms. Their names were Raceland and Lucifer, and they asked if they could take my inflatable castle there, um, Castle Fred on Fred Mountain. I said sure, I bundled it up, and I let them have it. Apparently, Fred mountain is still floating around out there, and it still is in some MUDs. Um, anyway, they put it in Darker Realms, and it was popular. Uh, there were some other ones that were much better written and themed, mine was a little all over the place.

But what's funny is, Lucifer was very kind of a dour kind of guy, very modlin, very not like me. So I would play with this, it would do things to try to make him laugh, and one of them was, I would grab my monster

 psychomatic, and I'd go grab things from the realm and put them in his wizard workroom. So yeah, I put the Terminator in there once, so when he logged in as a wizard, the first thing you do is appear in your workroom, and the first thing that happened is it would be like, "Are you Sarah Connor?" and I would start shooting them. Now Wizards can't be killed, although when I looked at the code for that, they only protected the damage function, the heal function could work on Wizards, and it took a signed integer. So at one point, I showed Raceland a wand of healing I made that could shoot out negative healing, and I showed it to him by negative healing his wizard to death. I got in trouble for that, and they wrapped the healing function in a wrapper too, to make it not apply to wizards. But I digress. So I would leave things in Lucifer's workroom. One of the other Wizards had made a glacial Plateau with Shaggy cows on them, called snow cows, that would occasionally go moo, but if you stayed there long enough, one of them would suddenly go moo, moo, I say. I thought that was the funniest thing in the world. So I would often leave a snow cow, or perhaps a herd of snow cows in Lucifer's workroom, until finally, he not only wrapped it in the uh, property that I'd made so that the Ronco wouldn't work there, he eventually banned me and made it so I couldn't go in his workroom anymore.

The funny thing is, Raceland, Raceland was so good. I mean, I looked at their code, I would look at these other Wizards' code, he was a good coder. This is about the time I had finished Rags to Riches, and I was making my own engines, and I told him what I was doing. He said that sounded really fascinating, and he was really interested in 3D. We needed a programmer for Starfleet Academy, and I had the Jay Patel, our technical director, do a phone interview with Raceland, whose real name is John Price. He did so well on it that they flew him out. I met him at John Wayne Airport, this is back when you go to the gate, and I had a little sign, I think it said Raceland. Got him at the gate, first time he and I had ever met in real life, took him to Interplay, he had an interview, knocked it out of the park, he got hired. He was the programmer on Starfleet Academy, his three engine way better than my 3D engine. That's why Fallout's a Sprite-based game, and Starfleet's 3D. He actually wrote a scripting language for Starfleet that we ended up using in Fallout. But he would tell people the stories of our MUD days, and I, I told people about these stories too, and I think it was Chris Taylor, our lead designer on Fallout, who thought it was super funny, and since we had Brahman, that is why in Fallout, occasionally, I think it's in one spot, but I'm not sure, there's a Brahman herd, and one of the Brahmin will go moo, because it's a call back to LP MUDs.

By the way, one lesson to learn from this very dumb story, your creativity will come from all kinds of places. Yes, I had a busy day, Graduate Studies can fill your day. I still spent a few hours every night playing around in LP MUDs. Creativity is not something that has to be confined to something you do professionally or as a hobby; it can come from anything, anywhere, tabletop, MUDs. And it's not a nine to five thing. I applaud all the efforts to make work-life balance better for game developers, and I agree with that goal. I'm just going to say right now, excuse me, I do not think that any creative profession, whether you're an artist, writer, game designer, can be fit in nine to five. You're going to have a lot of ideas outside of those hours, and for any producer that thinks they can fit them into nine to five and schedule creative ideas, you're going to be unhappy. In fact, that could probably be a whole video itself about passion and work-life balance, but that's not this video. Anyway, I just wanted to talk about MUDs. Have a good day.

My Top Five Video Games.md

https://youtu.be/2j6qqh3H-0Y?si=_Xe4TvbW9wvPp9Kj

**Intro**

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim, and today I want to talk about my top five video games ever. I've been thinking about putting this list together for months, but I was never quite sure which ones to include, and then I realized I really had to go with the ones that were really influential for me and were also maybe the first of its type that I ever saw. The first either one of its genre or one with that feature and not not I was originally putting in the games I had played the most, I had the most hours in, but I decided to go with ones that I thought were the most influential and the ones I really remember and go back to. The in this list, however, there is not a single game that is newer than 24 years old, and one of them is 44 years old, so strap in. The first one I'm going to go chronologically by the way so these are my top five but I'm not going to tell you what the order is, this is chronological.

**My first game is from Star Raiders 1979**, star Raiders, this was the Atari 800 version. This game amazed me. This game is 3D, it is a true 3D game done in 8k. To put that in perspective, the Star Raiders clone that I made in unity a few months ago, the executable alone is 639k, which is almost 80 times bigger. When you throw in the data, it's 500 Meg, which is 62,000 times bigger, and when you put the project together, what it takes to build it in unity, it's 6.5 gig, which is 812,000 times bigger than the original Star Raiders cartridge. Now yes, some people may look at Star Raiders and go, "wait, it's using Sprites," yes, it uses Sprites for the ships and the asteroids and the photon torpedoes, but the game is in 3D, the locations are all calculated as 3D locations. When you rotate, it's doing correct rotations. When you shoot a photon, it's actually shooting it out into a 3D space and looking for intersections. It does do a little cheap Sprite intersection thing that's part of the 6502, so sometimes you shoot a photon, and it will go out, and even though the ship's really far away, it will go out and then immediately explode. I'll give you that one. Keep in mind, this was done in 8k, so amazing. It was also done in Assembly Language and fit on a little teeny cartridge that you could plop in the machine. I was so amazed. I think I was 14 years old when that came out. I was so amazed by it that I figured out how to pull the assembly off the cartridge, and I would pour over it. That game is what made me learn the Atari 800 technology, the different chipsets it had, the difference Graphics mode, the extended Graphics modes, and Assembly Language, all of which led to me getting my first job, so I cannot not have this game on my list.

**The second game on my list is Ultima III, Ultima 3 Exodus from 1983**, although I will admit I didn't play it until 1987. I was a little busy, but I'll go into that. This is the first Ultima I ever played. I hadn't played one or two. I went back to the others after I played this, but Ultima 3 was my first love. It was my first RPG love, computer RPG. I loved party control. I loved the puzzles, including like figuring out how moon Gates worked because they didn't hold your hand in those older games. You had to figure all that stuff out. I figured out how to get marks in dungeons. The dungeons were in 3D. It was a top-down when you played the game, but the dungeons were 3D. The Final confrontation with Exodus was amazing and surprising, and the whole thing was just great. As an aside, it was level scaled. When you were Outdoors, the things you ran into overland were scaled to your level, but dungeons were not. The dungeons had a fixed difficulty, usually pretty high, so if you went in early, you just got creamed, you just got destroyed. I like that. My old teenager brain noticed that, and it was in the back of my head the whole time like, "oh, you can do different kinds of level scaling. You don't have to pick a level scaling model and apply it everywhere." So I like that. Now I said mentioned I didn't play it until the summer of '87. I was in engineering school when this thing came out, and I just didn't have time, and I was working a video game job. Well, that job, they didn't need me the summer of 87, and that was after I graduated from UVA and before I went to graduate school at UCI, so I spent the summer playing this game and gardening. My mom told me to do it. She said, "hey, look, you're never going to have another summer off the rest of your life. Why don't you take the summer off and just relax?" 'cause that's how cool she was, and I did. I gardened every morning. I got up, checked on my garden, weeded it, talked to my two retired neighbors, Kelly and I don't know Mr. Burgess's first name, and Mr. Burgess. They would talk to me about what I was gardening, and then I would go inside and play Altima 3 the rest of the morning and the afternoon. Awesome summer. And then after I finished, after I went to grad school, the next two years, when I was working on my master's, you have no free time. The Masters is very intense. So since 1987, the summer of '87, have I played RPGs with better graphics? Yes. With better stories? Yes. With better characters? Of course. With better mechanics? Yes. But Ultima 3 is still better for me. It's the one I remember igniting the crpg fire in me, so it had to be on the list.

**The next one, Star Control 2, 1992's Star Control 2.** I had played Star Control one, which was just called Star Control, but I was really, I just played the two-player combat mode. A friend of mine owned it, and we'd go and we'd play it, and it was super fun, reminded me of Space War, which was a standup arcade game. But Star Control 2 was what exploded my brain case. It was not linear in its storyline. It was open world, actually more than that, open Galaxy. It had a great story full of funny characters that were very memorable, a really dark storyline when you dug down. It was a funny game with a dark storyline. This game was a huge, huge influence on me for Fallout. I cannot understate how much Star Control 2 influence Fallout. And while I loved the playing the storyline, I also loved the combat and playing different ships against each other. That's what made combat so fun was you had an armada, but you had to choose what ship to send in to fight their ship, and the different ships

, it was like rock, paper, scissors. You had some ships you're like, "this ship is so weak, but it's really good against this type of ship." And the music in that game was phenomenal. I still hum the music today. Every now and then I start doing the Utwig durge in my head. It's just, it was such a good set of music. Now for people who think, "well, it's weird this would be on your game," well, Star Raiders wasn't an RPG, Ultima was. I consider Star Control 2 an RPG. Your character, if you consider the character is your ship, everything about it's an RPG. You upgrade the ship, you have hit points on it, which is your crew. And as I wrote in Philip Pepe's book, the crpg book, I consider this an RPG. It's got every characteristic of an RPG; it just so happens that the character, player character, is a ship. So that one's got to be on there.

**My fourth one is from the next year, 1993's Star Wars X-Wing, Star Wars X-Wing.** Yes, I played Wing Commander, but I loved Star Wars and the original trilogy, and I loved this game more. It just absorbed my mind. I went out and bought a joystick for my PC just to play this game. It was true 3D, and what I loved about it is what that meant was, and I suppose because Star Wars, all the ships are gray, so the fact that they were just usually flat Poes, it didn't matter, they looked good. The X-Wing Fighters and the Tie fighters looked good, but when they turned, they really turned. And in Wing Commander, because they were Sprites, they went, which you kind of noticed but pretended not to. The Star Trek game that they were making at Interplay when I started, Star Trek 25th anniversary, it had the same Sprites that tilted like that. But X-Wing was true 3D, and I loved it, and the music and sound effects were spot-on. They sounded right out of the movies. The weapons felt like they were from the movies. I love that you had to balance power between the engines and the Shields and the weapons, and that was under your control. It was just an amazing simulation of being in a starfighter. I loved it. I think I ended up playing it so much I wore out my joystick, and then the first GDC I went to in '94, I won a joystick at the Logitech Booth. I forget what I did to win it, but I won it, and so I got a new joystick from that and kept playing X-Wing.

**And then my number five, remember, these are chronological, was 1999's EverQuest.** Now I've done a whole video about how I compare EverQuest to Elden Ring and how I fell in love with LP muds, and I'll link those below, but EverQuest was my first experience playing a professional MMO, and it addicted me. It was big, huge world to explore, tons of lore. It was hard, it was fun, it was punishing, really punishing, and really rewarding. It forced you into groups. I've talked about my one of my groups was the Spicy Girls, where we all played a spice girl. I was Posh. I also had another group called The Necro Squad, which was all necromancers, and we just ran around. We discovered we go into zones way higher than we should have been able to because our skeletons could just, we could just keep creating skeletons as they died. I also had a group called The All Hobbit group. I have a picture, um, it was a tribute to Sam Wise from Lord of the Rings, so we had Fred Wise, I was Fred Wise, Unwise, Harry Wise, Ami Wise, and Kent Wise. So I thought that was funny. Keep in mind, I was working like 14-hour days making Arcanum, and then I come home at night and play EQ for a few hours. I was totally addicted to this game, and I learned all the ways that a single-player game differed from an MMO in difficulty, in combat, and exploration, and how to tell a story. It was just a different experience. All of those, those mechanics of an RPG change when there's a thousand players running around, just how you give a quest, how you advance quests, whether players could hurt each other, all those had to be figured out, and EverQuest was my first experience. I hadn't played UO. I played UO a little bit, but I played it later. Those games had to figure all this out, and this game, EverQuest, directly led to me wanting to make an MMO, which led to me working on WildStar at Carbine, so it had to be on this list.

Okay, so those are my top five video games, the most influential video games in my life. I'm sure you guys were hoping I'd list something else, probably was in my top 10, but these are my top five, and I think you can see influences of them in my games if you look hard. Anyway, hope you liked it.

My University Game Development Class.md
Youtube Link:
https://youtu.be/RY_tqjx_iFc?si=V2v-K1ylUigj59tb

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim, and today I want to talk about my university class in game design. This isn't a new thing, this isn't something I'm teaching. I want to tell you about a class I taught at the University of California, Irvine in the spring of 99. Now, I've got my glasses on because I actually found my course notes. I have an overview, which is what I'm going to go over, but I actually have the individual lecture notes for each one of these, but since each one was an hour, it would take me—it's a 10-week course—it would take me 10 hours to go over these, so instead I'm going to go over an overview of what this class was and what I taught.

It was IC 180G, which was an information and computer science project class. It was intended for third or fourth-year students, but it was open to non-computer science students, which turned out to be really important because since this is a project class, some of those non-computer science students were really in demand when it came to breaking up into teams—people who could make music, people who could do art, people who had really good writing skills. They were in demand, but I'll get to that.

Just as about background real quick, I got my master's degree in computer science and AI at UCI in 1989, and I was in the PhD program, but I left in '91. That's when I went to Interplay, contractually making Bard's Tale Construction Set, and then I moved in early '92 and became a full-time programmer at Interplay, and that's when I made Rags to Riches. So, it was a few years later when I got contacted by the university and said, "Hey, would you teach a class in game development?" And I was like, "Sure, let's do this." So, I worked with Dan Frost, a professor there. It was a 10-week course, and I'll go through what we did in each week. He taught Monday—I'm sorry, he taught Tuesday, I taught Thursday. I only have the notes on what I went over, so I will go over this, week by week.

So, let's start. 

**Week 1:** We actually met on April 6th, which was a Tuesday, and he had me introduce myself to the class and go over what I had done. And then on April 8th, I lectured on how the industry works, and the topics I covered were Publishers versus developers, internal versus external development, subcontractors, game genres—and I not only went over each game genre but I had sales information because they all sell differently. The one I remember is RPGs have really long tails, meaning an RPG can come out and it'll still be selling years later, unlike flight Sims which pretty much do 90% of their sales in the first six months. I also talked about consoles and the Mac because those are getting to be a big thing. I talked about the mythical 18-month development cycle, which now I laugh at 'cuz now it's 3 years, 5 years, 8 years, but back then, games were supposedly made in a year and a half. I described what an alpha was and a beta, and then going gold. I talked about how to get a contract, how to start a company because by then I was a year in DET tra. I talked about self-publishing, which is when you have a company that both publishes games and makes games. Monolith had just started doing that. I talk about direct sales and I did a comparison on how much money it would take if you wanted to make a million dollars, how many units you'd have to sell in direct sales versus self-publishing versus published. It was quite a bit of a difference, people were quite shocked. And then I ended up week one talking about retailers and things you have to do to get on the shelf, to get an end cap, to get posters up, just a bunch of things you have to do. But sizes of boxes, just a million things. So that was week one.

**Week 2:** I talked about teams, and this was important because very soon, I believe at the end of this week, they had to break up into teams. I talked about how teams are done in the industry; they're usually assigned but not always. And I talked about how Fallout, I got to attract some people to it. I talked about how sometimes a game is matched to a particular team if it's team has a particular strength—Graphics, networking. I talked about once you have a team, how you match up assignments to team members. And I went out of my way to say I thought the number one element of that was the person's interest and number two was their ability. Now, you didn't want to assign something to someone if they couldn't do it, but you also didn't want to assign something to someone if they didn't want to do it, if they had no interest in it. That put me at odds with a number of other producers at Interplay at the time. I talked about how to keep up motivation on a project, handling problem team members which came up. I talked about the difficulties of being both a manager and a programmer and a designer, so basically having to be running the team and on the team at the same time. And I talked about the importance of meetings. Yes, this was April 15th, 1999, and I was explaining to people why meetings were very important. To this day, people deny that meetings are important, and to this day, I repeatedly tell them how wrong they are. So, I've, I was telling them back then too. Too many meetings is a bad thing, but when somebody tells you meetings are dumb, we should never have meetings, that's not a person I want to work with.

**Week 3:** April 22nd, I went over design docs. I've kind of done already a video here about it. I talked about the separating a design doc into engine specifications versus the game specifications, which a lot of publishers want. Talked about the important of writing the background story so that people understood what world was being made with that game. Then design specifications for the game story itself, for locations, for different levels, for missions, for quests, anything that has to do with the game. Characters that you're going to make in the game, and characters that the player can create. I talked about artwork and I broke it up into game artwork and UI because those are often done in wildly different styles and by different artists. I talked about making and maintaining schedules, and I talked about estimating costs. I'm not good at the last one, and I warned them they wouldn't be good either, so they had to be flexible. If they think they're going to estimate things precisely, well, they're going to have trouble in this class. I said be ready to be flexible, be ready to drop features, be ready to have to do a little extra work to get something in if you really want it.

**Week 4:** April 29th, I talked about—um, this one was a little more technical. I was saying I'm talking to the programmers today. Talked about how to choose an algorithm, because there's lots of different algorithms you

 can choose, and often best isn't possible. You either don't have the memory, time, or there simply isn't a known good algorithm for the task you're trying to solve. I talked about texture mapping in open space 3D worlds, how you have to do make multiple texture maps to reduce level of detail when things are distant. I talked about pathfinding in a large world because I had done a pathfinding for Fallout, and I was in the midst of riding pathfinding for Arcanum. Uh, talked about when you make sprites, how they 2D or 3D, how to make the hot, how to find the hotspot, which is the point the sprite is rooted at, so when it animates it doesn't move around. So you know when a two or three-dimensional sprite enters a collision volume. Remember, this predates having an engine that did this for you, so I explained to people how to do this. I talked about the importance of caching art and other assets because 99% of the time back then, your available memory was way less than the memory the game needed to run, so you had to handle swapping and caching assets yourself. I went into detail on memory management. Um, this is where it really got technical, where I talked about malak, realic, and free. I talked about the difference between calling exit to shut down your program versus freeing up all the memory first. I talked about the difference between having a something fail versus having it return null. I talked about how to manage inventory, both as a programmer as user interface, and then how the players might think of it. And I reminded them that bin packing, which is if you have a grid and you're doing inventory on a grid, bin packing is NP complete, so keep that in mind when you make an algorithm to compress someone's inventory for them, which we did in Arcanum. I also ended up that lecture with the difference between C versus C++. I went into ta on both of them, why you may want to use C still. I was using C for Arcanum, but I was leaning towards C++, and by the time we went to Vampire in 2001, we were in C++. Notice I didn't mention C#. I didn't learn C# until 2005, so this was 1999. I didn't talk about it.

**Week 5:** were student pitches. We had broken them, everybody in the class, and I believe there was about 60, there might have been 80, we had broken them up into teams. Week 5 was them pitching us. That the day I came in, that Thursday, instead of me talking to them, I said pretend I'm a publisher and pitch me. So they gave me their pitches, and I gave them two responses. This is what I think a publisher would say, and then this is my recommendation to you. Um, for most of them, it was I think you can do what you're doing, you may have to reduce scope. Uh, I have questions about this, you didn't really explain how this is going to work. I need more information about this. Um, I would recommend, because remember, they had to have it make a demo, they had to have a project, a demo done by the end of the class, that was third grade. I recommended scope and content for their demo. So that was week 5.

**Week 6:** Which was May 13th, I talked about artists and programmers, uh, because that was an interesting way. Designers were somewhere in the middle, but artists tended to be one side of the brain, and programmers were the other. And I talked about how they could communicate, how I tended to do it. Um, I was often in between artists and programmers. I brought up Jason Anderson, who I started TRA with, who was the most—the best person I had met to date at being able to bridge the gap between programmers and artists, which is why he was called the technical artist on Fallout. Talked about what that is, uh, talked about how ideas flow back and forth between these different groups, talked about who makes final decisions, when it should be the lead programmer, when it should be the lead artist, and when it has to be the project lead. I talked about technical skills I felt artists should have, things they should understand about their computer and the tools they're using. And I ended up with a list of things that I knew artists hated about working with programmers. So I said, programmers, listen to me when I say this list because most of the artists you're working with in this room probably think this about you. I probably stirred some things up there.

**Week 7:** May 20th, was interface issues. I talked about interface because this has always been a big thing. It's still a big thing. Making interfaces are one of the big time sinks in any game you will make. Seriously, when I'm working on my Unity fun toys that I did a video back months ago, I almost always stop when I hit interface because interface to me is just... I don't enjoy coding it, but it's super important, so it's in my brain going, "You have to do this," but I don't want to. But it's important. I know. I told them too little interface can be non-intuitive because there was a big push towards, "I want nothing on the screen." Too much is overwhelming. It's like, somewhere in there, there's a game, but it's being obscured by this interface. Usually, though, the rule is less is more. So if you can figure out a way of doing an interface with fewer elements, that's a win. I talked about when to use a keyboard versus when to use a mouse. Um, I hadn't made a console game at that point, but I talked about then when you make it on a console and you have a controller, how you're going to map those things. And that some things that are at on the interface level are easier to do if you have a mouse, and other things are easier to do if you have a controller, and it's hard to make the same interface work well for both. Remember, this is '99, and we're talking about that stuff. I ended up with a caveat of thinking about multiplayer early, and I put this in the interface section because this is what people always forget about—all the extra interface stuff that's needed if you make a multiplayer game. And I'm not just talking lobby. I'm talking, once you get in the game, telling players from NPCs, having a player group, all the extra interface elements you get if you have a party. Think about that early because if people learn how to play the single-player game, they don't want the multiplayer version to be dramatically different in terms of interface.

**Week 8:** Which was May 27th, I talked about all the different kinds of development jobs. Programmers, I talked about scripter, junior, senior, lead. For producers, I talked about assistant, associate, and senior. For directors, I've talked about division directors, technical directors, art directors, QA director, music director. For artists, there was junior, senior, lead. For QA, there were juniors, staff level, and lead. For musicians, I broke—I, I didn't

 know how they broke them up. I've never had anyone say I'm a senior musical person. It was usually sound effects, music, and music was broken up into MIDI and digital. Um, then there were lots of non-development jobs, and I just—I listed them real quick to just go, there are so many people who are supporting what you're doing that you don't see every day. Marketing people, salespeople, uh, PR—press relations—people, production people, admin. These are the people that make all those players be able to play your game. And then I finished up that one, now that I grabbed all the jobs of—I gave my advice on how to land a job. And yes, even back then, I was saying, you got to make a demo. Now that there's game engines out, I pretty much say, make a demo.

**Week 9:** Was when they presented their projects to us, and it was interesting. I think we did it a week early because they had finals in their other classes, but also if there was something egregiously wrong, they had an extra week or two to work on it before we were done done. So, week 10, they—we came back, and we had another lecture.

So, on June 10th, I gave a lecture on creating games for the world market, which back then, you know, there was a lot of things people didn't think about. And I'm not just talking about translation, although I'll get to that. I started with talking about violence in art, which were things like showing blood, showing bone, which were legal or illegal in different countries around the world. I talk about violence indeed, such as can you kill children, which some countries said absolutely not, and other countries are like, "Yeah, we prefer if you didn't, but whatever." And then finally ended with all the ways that translation issues had to be addressed. This is everything from making sure that you didn't embed text in your code, that you always pulled your strings from a string table, what the formats of those string tables were. There's a million ways of doing it. Text length, which is what's the biggest string you can load in, and how do you display it, how do you fit it on the screen, which goes back to the user interface I talked about during week seven. I talked about procedural string generation, which is creating sentences on the fly, which even if you're not doing procedural dialogue generation, you may need to do procedural string generation with your character's name or strings that you're generating where you're inserting a gender or a reference into that string. Having to worry about male versus female gender, not for player characters, but also for words, and a lot of languages out there that have gendered words. I talked about special characters, which were extended ASCII, and then multi-byte Unicode, which has now become standard, but back then, people tended to just use ASCII, which was 8-bit, and then they would basically have a lot of pain if they were going to countries that only could use multi-byte characters, such as a lot of Asian languages.

So, that's what we ended up, week 10. And I even told them, these are things you didn't need to know for this class because you are making the game for me. I'm the publisher. But once you go out there and get a job, you're going to be thinking about, "What do I have to do because my game is going to go out to the entire world?"

So, that was my 10-week UCI class, IC 180G, spring of 1999. I hope you liked this walk down memory lane.

My Work Pattern For Designing.md
Youtube Link:
https://youtu.be/GwVocugnoEo?si=eZa0Us4yl9kEN_GE

Hi everybody, it's me, Tim. Today I want to talk about my work pattern for designing, and you can consider this a companion video to the one I did on programming, which I'll put a link in the description. This is actually answering a question from PostNuke Productions who asks, "You've done a few videos about what it's like to program a game, so could you give us an idea of what a day working as a designer is like?" I like this question. I'll clarify it though that I'm going to write down what I assume it's like being a system designer. A level designer and a narrative designer would have a very different day. Level designers would work with artists more. Narrative designers would be more interested in the quests and the storyline and spend a lot of their day writing characters. So I'm going to go as if it's a system mechanic designer, 'cause that's what I'm most familiar with.

By the way, you might want to check out the work pattern for programming because a lot of things I'm going to mention here are very similar to what I do when I'm a programmer. It's not that I view the same jobs as similar, it's just when I'm, it's just me how I do a job. So I'll get right into it.

First of all, I like to get in early. I've said this before, I like to get in very early because most game developers don't get in early. Almost everywhere I've ever worked, when they say we want people to be in by 9, most people roll in around 9:30. They treat work hours as suggestions. I don't know why. I've seen this in game development and brought it up to my friends who work in other industries, and they're like, "Whoa, that person would be fired. You can't just like roll into your job a half an hour late and go." But that's just how a lot of game development work. They usually say our core hours are, and they have a set few of hours, like between 10 and say 4, so some people come in earlier, some people come in later, but most people roll in kind of later in the day. I like to get in early because no one's around, it's very quiet.

I grab some coffee. Obsidian had the best cold brew coffee machine, which I believe is the origin of my addiction to coffee itself. I find coffee to be okay, coffee with a little chocolate flavoring, yeah, cold brew, amazing. So I'd grab some cold brew, I'd go through my email to see if there's anything I need to take care of, and then I jump in to actually writing design docs. Like I said in my programming video, I like to leave ideas, a list of ideas on a to-do list for me to start in on the next day. Usually, these are easier ones, like I'll have an idea for something, or I'll remember, "Oh, I didn't go and finish that list," or "I have to go change this mechanic," or "Somebody brought up an idea, let's explore it a little bit, see how it fits in with some other things in the game." I would put those on a to-do list, and I'd sort of organize them a little bit by priority but also a lot by what I thought would be easy to do. That way, when I get in in the morning and I start in on my tasks, you slide into working by doing a few easy things, you knock them out, you're like, "Look at me," and then when you hit a harder one, you're already kind of in the zone. This worked really well for me for programming, started doing it for design, works really well there as well.

I tend to have meetings in the late morning. Certain kinds of meetings happen late morning. By for me, late morning is 10 or 11 in the morning. Sometimes people are rolling in. I can't tell you how many times I went to a 10:00 meeting and someone would roll in 5 or 10 minutes late 'cause they literally just got to work. It was very frequently the same people. So, some like I said, some people just cannot deal with mornings. So the meetings that tended to be ones that I would attend as a designer were design meetings with other designers, like you're going to talk about combat, or you're going to talk about inventory, or you're going to talk about what we want to do with quests, and you meet with other people on the team who are doing that, other people on the design team who are doing that.

Contrast this with meeting with a strike team. A strike team is a mix of developers. It's an artist, programmer, designer, somebody from audio, sometimes somebody from QA, depending on how far along the strike team is, and a producer or an AP to actually work on defined designed features. So you may have a combat strike team, you may have a stealth strike team, you may have an exploration strike team, you may have a dialogue strike team, you may have a town strike team to actually work on, "We're laying out this town. We kind of, you know, want people involved in knowing who, how much rooms do we need to have, how do we make it look like a lot of people live here even though there's not rooms for everybody," things like that, and you get it worked out.

The strike teams are also where, because there's an AP there, the starts tracking tasks to see if they're going along at a pace fast enough that things will get finished on time. Strike teams have a usually have definitive start end date, so they're usually assigned like on this milestone, we're going to do ranged combat strike team, and the idea is ranged combat will be heavily worked on by this strike team, and since they meet once or twice a week, you can steer things like if it turns out something's taking longer to implement, you can steer and say, "Well, why is it taking so long? Oh, we have a lot of ranged weapons. Let's reevaluate our estimates. Oh, we have a lot more ranged weapons than we thought we'd have. Maybe let's get rid of a few." That happens during the strike team, which is why you need a producer person there.

Some other meetings I tend to go to in the morning would be meetings with other leads, like if I was a lead system designer, I might have a meeting with the lead quest designer and the lead narrative designer and the lead level designer. If sometimes there are director meetings and they ask some of the leads to come, so like the art director and the programming director and the design director are having a meeting on about the project, and they invite several of the leads from their departments to come along to talk about particular topics that are going to come up in that particular meeting.

And then the last, morning meetings tend to be if a publisher's in town. They like to come into town the night before, so sometimes you go to dinner with them, or they go to dinner with the director or the leads, and then the next morning meetings start, and so some of those meetings will the publisher will be in the morning.

You also sometimes do marketing and PR meetings with people in those departments when they're starting to build up

 what the plan is for your game, especially in the last half to third of the game's development, when those plans are rolled out.

Then after lunch is kind of a different vibe because, you know, everybody's there. After lunch is when I tended to have individual talks. This is when I would want to go talk to another designer for an idea I had. I call these "whatabouts" and "wh ifs" where you go and you're like, "What if we change this?" or "What about adding this?" And we talk about this is when we go do things on whiteboards. Sometimes I'm going to programmers who are working on a particular design of mine, and I go in and I'm just, "Hey, how's that going along? Hadn't heard from you in a couple days. Want to know if you've hit anything, stumbled on anything, or had an idea about something." And I'm like, "Hey, has this come up yet?" That's usually an afternoon thing.

But I also sit down and do a lot more writing. So based on all those talks, whatever decisions were made, I dive into some of the heavier stuff. So we've, we've chewed on things, I've done work in the morning, I've chewed on things with people at meetings and in individual talks. I try to crank out some of the heavier stuff in the afternoon. Anything I think of that's lighter goes on that to-do list for the next morning.

And then some things that can happen throughout the day would be anytime an individual designer wants to come in and go over something, that could happen whenever they want to do it. We usually use Slack, so instead of just walking into someone's room and going, "I'm interrupting you," you tend to Slack them and go, "Hey, do you have a free 15 minutes?" And they're go, "Yeah, come by in a half an hour." So we do things like that.

Also, the afternoon is when I tend to, when I noticed that's when questions would come in from programmers who were working on specific tasks from my own designs. So they might want a clarification of something, they might point out something that was left out that now that they're coding it, they're like, "Hey, I don't know how big these, you know, area of effect radii are," or "Could you tell me what the maximum range is you think anyone's ever going to throw anything, so I can work out how to do prediction arcs," and things like that. So those are things that tend to happen throughout the day, whenever those individuals need help.

And then what I described to is most of the design cycle. It's a little different at the beginning because you're really doing a lot of design docs, and there may not even be other people assigned to the project yet. But later in the development cycle, you start to do a few things that only happen later.

One of them is you play the game because it's now playable, and there's a lot of levels, and there's a lot of features put in, and you're looking for bugs, but everybody playing the game is looking for bugs. One thing a designer does specifically when they play games is they look for inconsistencies between the game and the written design. So this is the time where a designer will discover, "Hey, I did not want dialogue to work like this. We had a rule of like no more than five, no player response nodes for any dialogue NPC dialogue node, and I see several here with seven," or "You may go, 'Hey, the ranged combat isn't, um, you know, shotguns are still really powerful at a distance. I thought we talked about them having a really, you know, dramatic fall-off range. Is the data wrong? Because I looked at the data and it looks right. You know, could we look at the code?'"

Those are the kind of things that QA might not catch as a bug because they're basically not there, an inconsistency between the design and the implementation. Another thing you might do for QA, though, that would help them a lot, is give them test plans. This is something we didn't do earlier on that we started doing. I mentioned in the in the tra videos how the Atari QA barely tested bards or halflings, or they just didn't like them. And I could, I remember specifically the vampire Bloodlines QA, they didn't like playing Nosferatu, and so we discovered really bad bugs with Nosferatu because they were hardly tested.

This is a good time for designers to make test plans and say, "When you QA this game, test these classes, test these class race combinations, test this set of skill and perk combinations." Now, there may be the number of combinations may be in the tens or hundreds of thousands or more. What you want to do, though, is catch some of the big ones and make sure that, "Hey, range characters are viable, melee characters are viable, talking characters are viable, exploration characters are viable, dialogue characters are possible, stealth characters are possible." You want to do things like that.

I remember when I was playing Outer Worlds, I did an entire melee playthrough where I didn't let the character ever use a ranged weapon, and I got to one level that was almost impossible for me to play, and I pulled in the lead designer, and we both played it together, and he managed to get through, but he did admit it was way harder, and it was because there was a lot of verticality to the NPCs. We fixed that. We added some NPCs that would run down, they had melee weapons only, so they'd run down to get at you, and we added some cover at the base so you could hide from the ranged attackers.

And then the other thing that happens late in a development cycle is you tend to have more meetings with press. These might be video calls, or then press might actually come through. Sometimes they even have press days where they invite 5, 10, 15 journalists to come. You may be called on to give a presentation about the game. They may play the game for an hour and then have questions afterwards, and you may be invited to go to that Q&A. These are just things that happen during the development of the game that you have to be prepared for. And luckily, by this stage, as a designer, you probably have more free time than, say, the programmers or QA people. So you're called upon to do those because your knowledge of the game is pretty deep, but you probably have more time than those other developers.

So, I think that I hope that answers all of your questions, Post Nuke Productions. That's as close as I can think of as what a day in the life of a designer would be, and I think it's pretty similar to my day in the life as a programmer, except I'm doing design instead of code.

My Work Pattern For Programming.md
Youtube Link:

https://youtu.be/jIV4BTuq6QQ?si=m9CosJKM65et8Xju

Hey everyone, it's me Tim. Today, I want to talk about my work pattern while coding. This is something several people have asked. Um, the one I wrote down as a reminder to do this video, uh, what have you asked, "What kind of work pattern do you personally find most productive when coding? Do you set out designated time periods where you focus entirely on work, then take a break?"

So let me talk about that. I've done a lot of different things when I have worked. I've talked about started as a programmer, then started doing a lot of design as well, then got into production. Pretty much done everything but art. So, but this talk, I'm really going to talk about programming because I found that of all the tasks I've ever worked on in game development, programming is the one that is most sensitive to being interrupted.

When I'm coding, and I'm sure a lot of programs are like this, you're kind of building a structure in your head of whatever algorithm you're working on, what's left to do on it, what your variables are, what globals you're thinking about, what other functions need to be written. In fact, a habit I started doing early on is whenever I would get interrupted, I had a little keystroke I would do, it was slash slash zzz, so it was a comment with three Z's, which just meant I got interrupted at this point.

I'm kidding you not, I started doing that on Rags to Riches because Bard scale construction said I mostly coded at home, but Rags to Riches I was in an office environment, got interrupted a lot because in interplay I worked in a cubicle for years, and then I think I I shared an office for years after that, it wasn't until probably the last year and a half of Fallout that I had my own office. So when I'd get interrupted when coding, I'd put that slash slash zzz in, nine times out of ten if I ever got a bug report from my code, I found the error within a few lines of a zzz, and I could have Pages without zzz. So I knew that getting interrupted messed up my programming.

So what I did was, I decided to get all my code done in my most productive period. Now for me, that's in the morning, because I am, at least now, a morning person. I didn't used to be. I used to sleep late and stay up late, so I did a lot of my coding at night. But about 20 years ago, I adopted, 23 years ago, I adopted a rescue Shepherd, and this dog got me up at sunrise every day to do what I called his perimeter check, where he had to go outside through the back door, go along the fence line up front because it was a wrap around yard, up to the front, check all the fence lines, and then he'd finally calm down and sit on the porch until I let him back in. And until he did that perimeter check, I could not sleep or eat or do anything, he had to go outside.

So I got used to waking up five or six in the morning, still do that today. I'm a morning person now, thanks Cooter. So, what I found is every office I ever worked in was far less crowded in the morning. I mentioned this in another video. People view you as a hero if you stay late, no one cares or notices if you come in early. I like to come in early, hardly anyone was around, and I could get a lot of work done when the office was very quiet.

Now when I'm working from home, I still noticed the house is quieter, the neighborhood is quieter, I can just get a lot more done when it's the morning. Starting at Interplay, actually probably before, I would listen to ambient music while I coded. That's why a lot of my music I've selected for video games is ambient, it's inspired by the ambient I used to listen to when I coded. A lot of Brian Eno, a lot of Harold Budd, um, Aphex Twin, uh, Selected Ambient Works is a really good one. Basically anything without, um, vocals because it lets you focus, and some of those artists have really long tracks. I believe Thursday afternoon and Neroli by Brian Eno are two of his, uh, CDs that are just one long 40-minute track, so I highly recommend.

So I would basically put those on, focus work all morning. Now, I know you're supposed to only work, take a break every hour. I would tend to work two or three hours, especially if I got in really early. If I got into work at six or seven, most offices don't start picking up until around nine or ten, so I'd work for two or three hours and then I'd take a break. Those are important.

Now if I was at the office, I'd get up after my morning code session and go walk around. I would check in on other people, just the people wanted it. I know I've mentioned that some people don't want me to check on them until it's the last day that something is due, other people wanted me to check in on them every day. They probably discovered that I walked by their office in the morning around nine or ten, it's because I was taking my coding break. I would check out on them, I'd go get something to drink. There was a cold brew coffee machine an Obsidian that was like Mana orgasoma from Heaven, it was awesome.

Um, when I had my dog Cooter at Troika, I'd go take them for a walk around nine or ten in the morning. Um, that's when I walk my dog now, I'm home with my lab Abby. I take Abby for a walk every morning at nine. I see a lot of my neighbors then, getting ready for work, they see me go by every day around the same time. Abby likes it, I like it, it's when I take a break. I also find that just literally moving around a lot, taking a break from me is more than just standing up, I've got to get up and move around.

Then when I'm back, that is when I would schedule meetings. So I like my meetings to be late in the morning, or in the afternoon, uh, whether it's production meetings, meeting with Publishers. Now when I do [Music] um, con, I'm working as a contractor at a couple companies, tend to schedule those meetings later. I mean they don't know that I'm up at five or six am. I usually do these videos like right now at six in the morning, I'm doing this video. So, all that stuff gets pushed to late morning and afternoon, along with if I'm gonna do design work. I like to push that into into later in the day. For whatever reason, whether I'm working on system mechanics, writing lore, back in Temple when I was writing dialogue, even though I shouldn't have been doing that, I found that I could get interrupted on that, and it didn't matter.

I did the zzz trick a few times, never ever correlated the zzzs on design work with interruptions. Most of it was, if there was design flaws, it was either something inherent in the system, or that system interacting badly with another system

, or a balance issue, because I was never good at getting numbers right. In fact, it's a good system, but the numbers aren't aren't balanced. Those things had no relationship to my interruptions. So eventually for design work, I stopped putting in the zzz, and so by the time I worked on Outer World, where we had shifted from doing word Docs with, you know, comments in the margin and stuff like that, we started doing online documentation on Confluence and Jira for both tasks and bugs, I never did the zzz trick with those because I didn't need it.

However, one trick I did do, and I really loved doing this, and I've been doing this for probably more than 30 years, and it's going to sound simple, and it's going to sound stupid, but I guarantee you if you are a programmer, this will help you a great deal. And the trick is this: when you're working on your code, always save something very simple, something easy to code, something easy to get into right away, for the first task you do when you get in the morning. So if I, if I while I'm coding I come across one of those tasks, I stop, I don't work on it, I set it aside, and then what I do is when I, when I'm finished coding for the day, and I write my notes, the very first note is, "Why don't you code?" and I write down what that element is.

The reason I do that is I find when I get in in the morning, I'm often this playing slate, and I'm like, "What did I do yesterday? I don't know, I did a bunch of things, I don't really remember what I did." If I write down that really simple, easy to get into task, what I find happens is I get, I see that note, I start the compiler in my IDE, and I start coding that simple task. Probably connects me, makes me look at the code, makes me look at other things, within 30 minutes, an hour, whatever, however long it takes to do that really simple piece of code, I'm back in that mindset, and I can dump jump into harder and harder tasks.

Having that first task to ease me into that mindset again, it's helped me for decades with my work. It just, I, I don't know if you have this, but I just can't like switch on and go, "Okay, I'm coding now." I find that if I have that nice, easy task to fall into, by the time I finished it, like all my code part of my brain is active, and I can do, I can jump into harder and harder tasks. So I like to leave a to-do list, but I always start it with the easy task.

So at least for me, that's what works for me, which is to sum up, early morning coding for two to three hours, starting with an easy task, and pushing meetings, and design, and production, and all other work to late morning and afternoon. This is the best way I've found a code. If you're an evening person, flip this and do all your stuff, other things in the morning and afternoon, and then late afternoon and evening, make that your programming time, if that's the kind of person you are. But I think it helps, in general, to figure out what kind of rhythm works well for you, establish it early, and then see if you can make that happen, no matter where you work.

So I hope this helps, and uh, I hope this answered the original question.

No Simple Answers.md

Hey everyone, it's me, Tim. Today, I want to talk about a variety of topics that have been questions that people have submitted that I've put on a list that I called "no simple answers." These were questions that were frequently, "hey, do you prefer this or this?" or "could you tell me the pros and cons of this and this?" or "why did you used to do this and then you did this later in other games?" And it basically boils down to No Simple Answers. There's a lot of different ways of putting in features and working in groups and making games, and some of them don't have simple answers. There is no clear best. There's no best practice, there's no best genre, there's no best way of doing a genre. So, I'm going to run through a bunch of these questions that got asked, and I'll try to tell you what the pros and cons are, and that way if you're making a game yourself, you can decide. Oh, and by the way, I found a shirt I didn't wear. I forgot I got a bunch of dress shirts. I'm not gonna wear dress shirts every day, but hey, new shirt.

Anyway, let's look at the first one. This—sorry, someone asked this a long time ago; it took me a long time to get to it. Somebody asked what I felt about isometric versus first person in RPGs. Is Isometric or First Person. And there is no—this is a perfect example of there is no answer of the best RPG is—boom, isometric or the best RPG is first person. What I like—well, first of all, we didn't use to have an option. Fallout was isometric not because we decided it's the best to be isometric. We may fall out isometric because we tried making different engines, or I did, and the isometric one looked the best and was kind of the best for what game we were trying to make, but we didn't have a big option there. The first-person games were low poly, low resolution on the texture. I just thought they were kind of looking. So we went with isometric. Isometric is great for tactical fighting, anything that you need to kind of know the lay of the land. You want to know where cover is, you want to know where the other enemies are, you want to know line of sight. That isometric games are great for that. It's also great if you're controlling a party because you can see your party all at once. You can zoom out and click on them, and it's just a much better way of controlling the group. First person, on the other hand, if you're a single-player character, first person is great, especially for immersion. You mean you're right there, you're seeing things, you can walk around and look behind things, you can go into buildings without roofs without having to wear roofs and walls getting in the way. So I like both. It really depends on what kind of game you want to make. Now the way engines work, it's really your choice. Decide what game you want to make and then decide whether or not it would be better as isometric or first person.

I don't know if you can hear it. I've got a dog snoring at my feet, so I apologize if it's coming up on this.

The next one is a number of people asked me about complex versus simple game mechanics because that's something I left out of my development preferences because I've done it both ways. **Simple vs Complex.** I will admit, a simple mechanics bring in more audience. If you want more people playing your game, the less complex your game is, it seems you seem to get more people to a point. If people think you're pandering to them or the people wanting complex mechanics and get very vocal, that can be negative as well. But the thing I like is complexity can be added later. You can start with simple mechanics and then make them more complex as the player digs into them. It's very similar to what I used to think about lore dumps in games. A lot of games used to be like, you know, you talk to someone and then they get into this big description of what's going on, and you're like, "how do I end this dialogue?" Now often we say like, "oh, I found this book," or "if you want to know more, you should talk to this person," basically letting the player know here's what you need to know, and if you want to know more, here's what you can do to get it. It's instead of saying here's a bunch of lore for you to wade through, there's a bunch of lore over there for you to find. And I feel the same way with mechanics. If your character creator throws a wall of information and data at the player right when they start up, and it's just an awful lot to take in, and they're not sure what's good, they're not sure what matters in the game, they haven't played the game yet, maybe you should consider some games make you do character creation after you play a level. Some make you pick very simple things about your character like this is what I look like, and this is my gender, and this is my name, and then they start buying things later. In Outer Worlds, we just made it so that you really only had to pick like here's a category of skills I'm interested in having. I'll worry about those skills later. So I like both. I think you can have both in the same game. But it really is, again, up to the game you want to make.

Someone asked me if I had a preference for deterministic or dice rolls for skill checks. And I assume they meant in dialogue, but it could, you know, easily be outside of dialogue. Obviously, I use dice rolls for combat, but the reason I—I personally prefer rolling. I love that element of randomness. I love like, did you happen to disable that trap, or did you trigger it? Did you happen to get that lock picked, or did your lockpick break off and jam the lock? You know, did you—you're talking to someone, did you manage to persuade them, did you manage to intimidate them, did you manage to get them to believe your lie? I like that. But I also understand that in this modern age where people prefer saves on demand rather than save points, people will just save scum everything. So it kind of reminds me of modern air travel. People hate it, what it's like, but we've created it. We basically decided I'm gonna pick the cheaper airline whenever I want to fly, so airlines all there was a rush to become the cheapest and then add fees in for everything else. Because everybody saves scum, we kind of went to just doing deterministic. You're like, "oh, your skills 50, he's persuaded," or "you have a lockpick of 40, you're allowed to play the mini-game on this lock; otherwise, you cannot, you can never pick this lock." And we did that just because everybody was save scumming. I don't want to go back to not giving the player the agency to do their skill rolls, so, or their save games, so I probably won't go back to skill rolls, at least

 not skill rolls outside of combat, and that's probably why.

One person asked what I liked better, working at small game development studios or big ones. This is very much a pro and con. I mean, I've worked at—probably the smallest studio I worked at was the first one, which was Pegasus, later Cyberon, that never had more than eight people at it the whole time. And then the largest one I worked at was, of course, well, Interplay got to be about 600 people, but team-wise, WildStar, which is already in the 150s or whatever, and I think went over 200, was the biggest team I worked on. Let me just say here are the pros and cons in my brain. On a small team, you know everyone, you know what everyone's doing, you know what they're working on, you know what people are good at, what they're bad at. You can assign out work based on that. Development tends to go faster; there's more feedback that happens because there's less overhead, so you're more nimble. If you try something and it doesn't work, you usually know soon, you can try something else before weeks or months have gone by, and you're like, "oh no, we've got to commit to this thing." However, small teams require a great deal of trust. It is very easy because people get responsible for things, they're the ones doing this. It's very easy for them to go, "yeah, yeah, everything's fine," and kind of sweep things out of the rug, and you don't find out about it for a long time. Big teams are really needed for certain kinds of games. It takes a lot more time to make a large open world, first person, high resolution, modern game than it took us to make isometric games in the past. You know, what we could have done with 20 or 30 people in the past now take 80 or 90. So you obviously need bigger teams to make certain games that you want to realize. Given that, that means there's a lot more overhead. This is why production people are more and more necessary on these bigger games. You need people to coordinate art and code and design and to make sure that when bottlenecks happen, those get flushed out as quickly as possible. This also creates a lot more—what I call—politics. In the middle of the office, you have people trying to think about where their career is going and how they can go up the chain and balance—sometimes work gets coordinated because of politics and not because of feature set or schedule. I've never been good at this. I've never been good at detecting this. I've never been good at playing that game. That's the game I'm not good at, the politics game. So, in general, I'm a little leery when game team—when team sizes go over a certain size. And because of that, I never really—WildStar was the first game that was I was ever going to make with a really huge team, and I didn't finish it. So in general, I skew smaller than bigger.

The last question wasn't really features; it was about how to balance generalist and specialist player characters, but I'm gonna put that in as hey, there's ways of doing both in a game. I like—I like having both. My early games skewed more specialist, and then later on, I began to go, "oh, it's kind of important. I really want generalists in here." And you can see this. I started doing this as early as Arcanum because, you know, we had the magic-tech, and there was a way to balance it out. Generalist characters are great for people who want to spread their points out, who want to be jack of all trades. It gives the player more options, and I think where that helps is on main story quests. If you remember when I talked about main story quests or things you are required to do to finish the game, and because of that, we had to make sure that any possible player character build could finish it. That meant the checks tended to be lower on if the remarkable ways of doing it, one of them had a pretty low check just in case someone had spread their points out like a generalist. That also means, though, that generalists have a lot more options when they do those main quests because if they can get their skills higher, either because they've been roughly general but there's a few they put more points in, maybe they can do one of the other methods, so they're not always doing it—a certain—the whatever the low one is that was picked for that quest. But we always tried to make the low skill point one different, different in different areas. Sometimes the combat was easier, sometimes talking was easier, sometimes stealth was easier. So the generalists going through the main story quest find that he has many different ways he's doing different things to get through those story quests. The specialist, on the other hand, has honed a particular skill and set of perks to their highest end. Yes, this gives them all kinds of bonuses, but it makes some main story quests harder because they can only really do it one way, and that way might not be the easiest way for that main story quest. Conversely, there are side quests that can be much, much easier for them because since we don't support every way of going through it, and we don't have require there to be a minimum check, if they get into a side quest that's up their alley, and it tends to be very easy for them because they've really maxed out their skills in that area. For the Outer Worlds, I'll tell you what I tried to do, is when we put in the skill unlocks for different skills, I try to make sure that the first and last unlocks were really cool for this reason. Generalists tend to buy a lot of skills, so they got a lot of first unlocks. I wanted to encourage that because those first unlocks were really cool. However, specialists tend to take a few of those skills up to maximum, and it takes a lot of points to do that. I tried to make the last one really cool so it was aspirational to get to the end of that skill and go, "wow, now I can do this really cool thing that a generalist will never be able to do." So I tried to hedge my bets on that one. I don't think I have a preference. In the future, if I were to make a game, I'd make sure that generous generalists and specialist characters were well represented. But I don't think there is a clear pro and con to these characters. I like playing both, in other words.

**Conclusion**

So, this video may make a good companion video to my design preferences because this is less of my design preferences in this and more of a here are a bunch of features that I and and situations game development scenarios that I can take or leave. I can work in either group, and I don't really have a clear preference. So, I think I hope that helps you realize that when you're facing some things in game development, there may not be a clear answer to what you're trying to do, and you really have to look at what's important to you and decide what to do based on that.so I hope that helped

Non-Linear Game Design.md
Youtube Link:
https://youtu.be/2hDxie2Fnvo?si=V_iXBZ-LU9pH2Tnl

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim. Today I want to talk about non-linear game design. This is something I've been doing ever since Fallout, so these ideas date back to 1994. But I see more and more games doing things like this these days and I love it because this is my favorite kind of game.  
   
## What is NonLinear Game Design   
  
What I mean by a non-linear game design is how do you make a world and the instances within it that are non-linear, meaning the player can choose the order they want to visit them in. Now, for me and my games, this comes with the extra difficulty mode of I always want to let the player make any kind of a character they wanted. I really don't like RPGs that force you to play a particular character. My attitude is, you make the story, I make the character. If you're going to make both then maybe I'll just go watch a movie. But I want your story to react to my character and that's where the fun comes in, that's what RPGs are all about.  
   
In an open world, you can go anywhere you want. But just because you can go there doesn't mean you should go there and the designer doesn't need to support you going there. So that means they can throw in all kinds of difficult encounters to discourage you from going to an area. Those could be Random Encounters like I mentioned in the Fallout random encounter video. Those could be Random Encounters that discourage you from even getting close to the area you're trying to go to.   
  
## Random Encounters   
  
As you approach, say this mountain, and you start encountering really awful, hard creatures, whole groups of creatures, traps and stuff, you may just go, "I'm not going to go there". Or you may get there and discover that that location is swarming with creatures that are too hard for you to fight and so high level they spot you if you try to sneak and you don't have any chance of talking to them. There could even be traps that do way too much damage for you to resist or way beyond your ability to disarm. There could also be environments that require climbing or swimming and when you fail you take damage and it's just hurting you far too much for you to continue.   
  
So it's okay then to have these areas. Oh, you could also put in, once you get to the area there may not be anything attacking you or harming you, but it just may need be that when you get there you discover that you need much higher skill levels than you have. There may be a computer that needs to be hacked or a door with a lock on it and it's way too high level for you to pick. Or there may be a guard and the only way, he's behind glass so you can only talk to him through a speaker and the speech skill you need is way beyond what you have.   
  
Fine, this lets players know, "Oh this is a place I can come back to". I view that as aspirational. Don't view that as demotivating, especially if the game makes it really obvious, especially if it's not always combat and damage that's discouraging them from going there.   
  
There's another thing you can do, you can prevent players from even going to some places and your game can still be non-linear. One thing we did in Outer Worlds was you were not a pilot so your ship flew, the AI in your ship flew it around. It could only land at a landing pad that it had an authorization. I think we called them keys, forget what we call them, but unless you had that Landing Pad authorization key, you could not land there. It wouldn't even show up on your map which meant you could go in the Fast Travel map and you could see Monarch, you could see the entire planet of Monarch, you knew it was there but there was no place you could go to on it because there was no place your ship was authorized to land.  
   
So that itself is aspirational because you know that location is there but you can't get there. Or you can go to a place but you could have a door that instead of being picked needs a particular key or key card or the computer that needs a path that can't be hacked and needs a particular password. Then if there's an NPC that won't give it to you until you're on their quest and they won't give you the quest either until you're a certain level or you have a skill that's high enough, basically you can prove to them that you're good for this, that's another way of locking something up that the player can't get to but they know they can come back and that's aspirational.  
   
## Branching Storylines   
  
So now let's go to the next part of making non-linear worlds which is branching storylines and this is a difficult thing. We worked through it on Fallout, we were far more branching on Arcanum with far more story points. This is probably one of the hardest things to teach incoming narrative designers who haven't played a lot of games like this. It's also one of the reasons why we've had difficulty getting people from who are book writers or movie script writers because they think linearly and you have to literally break them of that.  
   
So what I tried to do, this is an old thing I developed, I call it the football model of stories because it looks like between every two main quests, and I'll talk about quests later, but main quests are just all the quests you have to do along the story, the main story, consider all the different ways you can solve each main quest and you get a bunch of lines that go out and come back because they all go through the next point which is that Quest is resolved, so you can view it as a bunch of footballs that are interconnected.   
  
I view each point along that series of footballs as these are the same story checkpoints but because you solve them differently, you arrive at each story checkpoint with a completely different context from other players. So let me give you an example. Let's say one of the main story points that everybody has to go through is there's a town that's being raided by Bandits and you've been asked to resolve this.   
  
So, if you've played any of my games it's probably already popping in your head, I know a lot of the solutions. You could kill the bandits, you could kill the townspeople and say, "Hey Bandits, free town", you could kill both sides. We call this the Eric demote solution because that's what Eric DeMille the producer ever tends to do, he's like, "Kill Everybody, you know, problem solved". You could also convince the bandits to stop, you could either convince them there's an easier town to go raid which isn't very nice, you could intimidate them and go, "Look, this town is under my protection, if you continue to raid this I will kill all of you".   
  
Maybe that solution is only possible after you've killed a few of them or maybe you have to kill the leader and then the rest of them go away, no matter what you have to do, the Bandit stop or leave. You also might be able to convince the bandits to join the town. In other words, you don't have to fight, this town has a maybe this town has had a population decrease for some reason and there's empty homes, or maybe there's a lot of work that needs to be done there, there's a factory that needs workers or there's Farms that need workers or maybe the bandits are just getting tired or they want to settle down or they want to get married or something, you can convince them to join the town.  
   
The point of all this is, the end result is the player has resolved this Quest. They can also still go back and visit the town and your resolution they had can determine who if anybody still appears in the town, what NPCs are there, maybe it's a ghost town, maybe the original townspeople are still there, maybe the bandits are there, maybe they're both there.   
  
The cool thing is all you really have to do to support this is to have different greetings or initial dialogues with the player from the townspeople that are still there. Maybe the shopkeeper's like, "Oh, I love that the bandits are here, they buy a lot of stuff", or the factory supervisor's like, "They're good workers", or maybe the police chief is like, "Oh, I hate them, they get drunk every night and they're rowdy".   
  
Or maybe you killed all the townspeople and told the bandits to move in and they're just all hanging out, not doing anything, getting drunk on all the porches, it doesn't matter. It's basically you can control the level, designers can control spawn points and the narrative designers can write short, to the point, obvious dialogue to support the different endings you have and they don't have to be novels, just do that, move on, and you're only doing this for the main quest, remember.  
   
So now let's talk about what I mean by main quests. I often call these critical path quests. These are all the quests that have to be completed by the player to finish the game. They are required, they are not optional in any way. Because of my difficulty mode I mentioned where the player can make any kind of character they want, these also have to be completable by any player character no matter what their skill set, what class they picked, whatever different kind of characters you let people make, they have to be completable by any player character.   
  
Now on Fallout, we considered three ways of getting through any main quest. There was fighting, that's always the case, you can just kill people, kill them, boom, you've gone through. Notice that this often means you have to have quests that work with killing people. If you were supposed to rescue someone you have to figure out how to kill the kidnappers without the kidnapping being killed or else that Quest will fail. If you are supposed to learn something and you kill everybody, there better be a computer or a journal or a scrap of paper somewhere with that information on it.   
  
## Dialogue   
  
The second way, the talking way, the dialogue solution, most people think of that as you walk up, you say something, it's done. Maybe you could have a persuasion, you basically convince somebody, you know, of something, you've been like, "Hey, don't do this, let me through, whatever". You could also make the talking solution bribes, so you're going to have to come up with the money or maybe it's an item they want so you're off on another Quest and it could be a side quest because it's optional.   
  
You could lie to them and just say, "Hey, I belong here, I work here, I'm gonna walk right in". Maybe you have to show evidence of anything you're saying. So if you're trying to lie and say you work here, rather than just go, "Okay, your lying's really high, walk right in", they're like, "Okay, show me your pass". Now you better come up with a good pass, maybe there's a way to forge it, maybe there is a way to steal it off of a guard somewhere else who's maybe sleeping in a Barrack, maybe there's a way to pick the lock on a desk and steal an ID or a pass from there, boom, that's kind of a quasi stealth followed by talking way which gets me into the stealth way.   
  
There's a lot of ways, that's our third way of going through so there's dialogue, talking enough stuff, there's a lot of ways that you can do stealth paths. Most people think it's, "Oh, I sneak by them", that's one way. You can find alternate ways through that require a lot of climbing and crouching and going through vents or staying behind things that block line of sight. You can steal a key off someone and use that to go through some side door or some door nobody's looking at. You can hack a computer either to unlock a door or to set off an alarm somewhere so everybody moves off in that direction and now you're free to go through. There's lots of ways to do stealth paths.   
  
Now, starting with Fallout, we realized because we want all of these paths to be doable by any kind of character you want to make, what we did is every main quest had to be doable in all three of those ways. So we had to come up with at least one way of solving it that was fighting, talking and stealth and we always made one of those easier. By easier, I mean easier relative to the level you were supposed to do it.   
  
So if we thought this was a mid-tier quest story, we did, we would set maybe the lock was set to something that was a little lower than what we expected just in case you came there and you were a generalist and you spread all your points out and you're having difficulty finding them and you can't make the speech check, okay, turns out the lock is easy to pick or there's a sleeping guard somewhere who has a key on them and he's easy to pickpocket because those main quests have to be solvable. Now it's always okay to say, "You have to come back, you tried to do this Quest and you couldn't do it so you're gonna go away, get some more levels, spend those points, come back and do it", that's okay too.  
   
Now taken together, the critical path quests should form a complete story for your game and by complete story I mean it should resolve all the major questions. It's okay to leave some mystery, but it should solve all the major questions that have been brought up while you were playing and it should resolve most of the storylines. Like I said, it's okay to leave some mystery but frustrating if the player doesn't learn most of what they're after.  
   
## Side Quests   
  
So now let's talk about side quests. By definition, side quests are any Quest that can be skipped and the game can still be completed. If you think a main story Quest is skippable, it is not a main story Quest, it is a side quest. This means there can have to be some restrictions on side quests. There can never be a required item, an NPC that has to be talked to, that none of those can appear on a side quest because the player may skip them, they may not do them.  
   
Note then that this means we can relax that restriction. These side quests don't have to be completable by any player character. It's fine if a side quest only supports one or two of those ways through. Like maybe this one can only be, you just have to fight them. When you encounter a rad scorpion in the desert, it's a side quest, you're not gonna be able to talk to it, you're not going to be able to maybe sneak past it, just fight it. Side quests, if you want to support all three, that's great. If you want to support all three and there isn't an easy one, great, this is a side quest, the player can always run away and it will not prevent him from finishing the game.  
   
Now, I will say they should know what it is they're failing at. If they just walk up to a blank wall and they have no idea what, "I was supposed to climb, was there a secret door there, was there a lock I was supposed to pick", that's frustrating. Always let the player know, "This is why you're failing at this Quest, come back".  
   
So taken together, side quests answer either questions that weren't important for the main story or they resolve all the non-main storylines. So maybe someone was murdered in the Hub in Fallout, it's not important for the main storyline, but you feel like doing that Quest, they should probably find out who the murderer is, just let it be closed down.  
   
So all of your quests, main and side, should support your design pillars whatever they are. So if one of your pillars for example is that all playthroughs are equally challenging, don't put some super overpowered gun in halfway through that makes ranged Combat Characters super easy for the rest of the game because that makes the game feel, first of all, unbalanced, there's also it feels like the hand of the designer saying, "Yeah, you should have taken energy guns or you should have taken ranged weapons as a skill".  
   
## Design Pillars   
  
Also, if you have a design pillar that all of the playthroughs should be about the same length, so let's say you're going for 20 hours, 40 hours whatever for your playthrough, you need to make sure that none of those ways of playing through the main quests have shortcuts. If there's a really easy way to kill everyone like you walk in and press a button and a bottom kills everybody, that's going to make the fighting way too fast.   
  
If most of your speech Solutions are just walking up to someone, having a speech check and then going, "Okay, go in and get the item", that's bad, that's why I talked about a lot of speech checks either need you to have evidence or you need to bribe them and it's a lot of money so you may need to go come up with that money. You and it's okay to either have the money right then which means you did a lot of stuff to get that money or you have to go get the money, either way, time was devoted do something before you can just go through that speech check.   
  
So I think that's important. Now you may not have those design pillars, but you should have design pillars before you start a game, you should have nine pillars, maybe I knew need to do a video on design pillars, but just make sure that all of your quests are supporting them even if it's a side quest, even if it's a minuscule side quest with only one solution, it should not contradict any of your design pillars.  
   
## Ending The Game   
  
So now let's talk about how to end the game. I'm talking about all the ways it ends, I'm not just talking about narrative endings, I'm talking about encounters and quests and everything. Probably the biggest way I see open World Games fail is they had multiple Solutions all the way through and then at the very end they basically throw a boss creature that requires extensive combat skills. I've seen this so many times, it frustrates me because the player may be playing the whole game going, "I'm a good talking guy, I've made so many people happy, I'm gonna go in here and talk my way through this and then everybody will have everything they want".   
  
And then they go in and it's some bad guy with eight tentacles and a bunch of guns and you basically just have to fight them. It's why the master, that's an important combat and sorry encounter at the end of Fallout, but you can sneak your way through that area and explode the whole base with a nuclear bomb and you never even have to talk to the master, you never have to enter in the same room with them.   
  
And if you're doing the speech one, you can do it but you need the evidence from free back at the brother of Steel, she's been doing, she will send you out on quests where you studied super mutants. So now she's the one who figured out, "Hey, these guys are sterile". If you've done those side quests and you have that evidence and you talk to the master, not just going guns blazing, you can have a speech solution there and this is where I said it, the speech solution shortens the encounter with the master but you had to do all these things before you could have that speech solution.  
   
## Ending The Storyline   
  
And then to wrap up the storyline, I think the end slides should wrap up all of the main and as many of the side quests as you want. If there were undiscovered side quests, there can't be an Undiscovered main quest or they wouldn't have done it and they wouldn't be here at the end game, but if there are undiscovered side quests, you can, depending on what you want and what kind of side quests there are, you can either not mention them at all or there can be some kind of, "Well, you never went to Farmville and those people were having a drought and unbeknownst to you because you never went there, they all died".   
  
You could put something like that in and make the player go, "I'm gonna play again and I'm gonna go to Farmville". Or you can just not mention it, have them something, something they can discover on the next playthrough. You also want the end slides and the story wrap up to make the player consider playing again. They should maybe the ending isn't satisfying for them, maybe something comes up and they're like, "Well, maybe I shouldn't have killed everybody in that town or maybe I shouldn't have sided with this faction or maybe I should have spent a little more time working through this area", because they see something as an end slide they didn't like.   
  
And I think that's great, it's aspirational if you're clear what the player did or didn't do that led to that end slide and I see end slides as a as the narrative story wrap up. Some people call it a reward as well, I can, it is rewarding but I view that as the, the narrative designers are in charge of the end slides which is why they should have been keeping track of major player choices throughout the game so they can make those insights.   
  
And I think that's everything I wanted to talk about. I think if you follow a lot of these guidelines, you can make a very fun and rewarding and player aspirational, non-linear open world.

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim. Today, I want to talk about optimization. Now, I'm primarily going to be talking about code optimization, though I'll touch a little later on about how you can optimize other parts of the game. But basically, what I'm talking about is making code and scripts that are faster and tighter. Faster means it uses less processor cycles, and tighter means it uses less memory. Frequently, optimization is a trade-off of these two things. You unroll loops so they're faster but take up more memory, or you store extra things so they don't have to be recalculated, so you trade off and use more memory so you can save on cycles. However, that's not always the case. In wonderfully rare circumstances, you can find faster, smaller code.

The big thing about optimizations that I often find myself explaining to people who aren't programming programmer people who often, you know, are above me in the chain, is that you cannot do this early. You have to wait to see where cycles are being spent, where memory is being used, and then decide how to save memory and cycles. A perfect example of this, I was talking, um, the I think it was yesterday about the different demos we did for Fallout, and the very first demo we did, which was two years before Fallout shipped, was not optimized. It shouldn't have been. You don't want to optimize something that early and then have all those optimizations go to waste when you end up adding more code, changing features. It's it just shouldn't be done that early. A good example, if you watch the Arcanum prototype code though, that is an example though of something that we did very early on. Once we made those prototypes in Arcanum and had everything reference them for the rest of the game, that saved tons and tons of memory. It actually cost us a little though on cycles. You couldn't just here's an object, look at the field, there's your data. Sometimes, just look at the object, it doesn't have that field now I've got to go to another object and get the data there. But the amount of memory it saved was huge, so we were willing to take the extra few cycles to look up some data.

Now, frequently, at least 15, 20 years ago and longer, we used to optimize code by rewriting the C code, because we wrote everything in C. C was what much faster and could be optimized faster by the compiler than C plus plus. But even then, we would sometimes take that C code and rewrite it into Assembly Language. So, you would look for loops that were commonly executed, you would look for places that seemed slow in your profiler, and you would look at the code and you'd figure out how to write much tighter assembly code. Up until about 15, 20 years ago, a human could probably write better code than a compiler. This has changed, but it's not universally true. People can still write better assembly code in specific cases. Later, starting about 20 years ago, we started really using more compiler optimization flags, which did similar work as a human optimizing it. It wrote assembly, and you could say, you know, I want this to be faster, I want this to be use less space. So there are different optimization flags you could choose, and you could do it. The easiest way was to take an entire module and optimize it a certain way, but you could also, with using what are called pragmas, isolate specific sections of code and say, I want this optimized a certain way, or I want optimization turned off, because sometimes optimization from compilers just didn't work. Um, sometimes it would not get smaller or faster like the flag said it was going to do, sometimes it introduced bugs. In all those cases, what you were supposed to do is look under the hood, and by that, I mean, there are ways to get the compiler to show you the Assembly Language output it had generated when it compiled your code. You look at what got created and you fix it. Um, if it's not super important, you can also turn off optimization just for that area, where you can, like I said, you can take practice and go just for this area, I don't optimize for time, and then it would not make that mistake when it recompiled it. I have noticed a lot of younger programmers, or I should say less experienced programmers, don't seem to know how to do this. I've even run in a program I said didn't know that was possible, that didn't know that you could look up the Assembly Language output from a compiler. Even those that did, often viewed it as a waste of time, basically saying it's faster just to start playing with different optimization flags, optimize for different things, or optimized for to different um targets, and you could sometimes specify how much optimization you wanted to do. The flags took parameters. So I found a lot of programmers with just, if something broke, they would start randomly turning off the optimization flags until it worked again. Personally, this scared me a little bit, because doing work without knowledge bothered me, but I did witness it being very quickly a method to bring the code back up to functional state much faster than it would have taken for me to comb through the assembly. So I get it, and I get why people do it. Let's just say I think there's a trade-off, and I think both tools should be in your toolbox.

These days, too, optimization is a little different. Back in my day, we had to optimize for almost every video card that came out, especially when super VGA first came out. They were all handled differently, all handled in assembly. You had to write different ones for each one. It wasn't even an optimization; it was just getting it functional. It was hard to write one piece of code that worked on multiple video cards. But even now, PlayStations and Xboxes, their hardware worked differently, especially the PlayStation 3. When I made South Park: The Stick of Truth, the cell architecture of the PS3 made it harder to write for and even harder to debug for. You would place a breakpoint on a piece of code, and then you'd watch as it would hit that piece of code and then stop, maybe right there or right before, because multiple processors were running the code, and they were distributed, so you didn't always stop exactly where you wanted to. That took me a while to get used to. I've often seen the argument, too, that optimization these days isn't nearly as critical, which I understand. My argument is, it still important. I see a lot of wasted cycles and wasted memory in uh some modern games that I worked on. I would see programmers recalculate a value whenever they needed it, even though that value was not going to change, just to avoid either passing that data to other functions or not wanting to store it and then marking it as dirty. That's what we would commonly do. We calculate a value, and whenever anything that that value dependent on would change, it would just mark that value as dirty. So if your value was clean, you knew you could use it, and you did not have to recalculate it. If you saw it as dirty, then you'd call and recalculate it. That's not done very frequently anymore. I would often see programmers create a large array of data

 just to get a single element. This was something I saw on the game I worked on. A programmer would ask for an array of creatures in the area purely to get the one that was nearest to the player, which meant they would call function which would look at all the objects, collecting just the creatures, then would put all of them in an array, then it would sort the array, then it would grab the zeroth one off the array and throw everything away. I replace that with a function that, whenever a creature moved, it would calculate its distance to the player, and if it was now the closest one, replaced the value of closest NPC to the player with that value. If it wasn't, then I knew it didn't have to do anything. Similarly, if something died, it would say, okay, everyone has to recalculate who's the closest living one to the player. These are ways of doing optimization that meant when you wanted to know the closest one, which frequently happened, you didn't have to make an array and do a sort, grab one, and throw it away. That optimization made it both faster and use less memory. So, like I said at the beginning, and also I commented on when we when I talked about doing the six different demos for Fallout, optimization is really important, but you can't do it early. It's necessarily something that's delayed so that later on, when a lot of your code is stable, a lot of your data's in, so you see what's going to be processed by your algorithms, that's a time to do optimization. Something that you learned very early on in Computer Sciences, there's a lot of different sort algorithms. There's no one best one, because some sort algorithms don't work well if the array is already nearly sorted. Some don't work well if there's more to sort past a certain value, like if there's only a few objects to sort, most sorting algorithms work in the same amount of time, so implement one that is easy to use and doesn't use a lot of extra memory. If you have a lot of things to sort, you often then have to pay attention to exactly the pros and cons of the sorting algorithm you're using. There's also one called Radix sort, which uses a lot of memory but you can sort things very quickly with it. There's just some things about the data that have to be true.

Because optimization is both something that gets pushed to the end of the project and it's very difficult to estimate, it's very hard to find a programmer. I don't know if I've ever found a programmer, and I've worked with some smart programmers, that can look at a piece of code and will tell you how long it will take to optimize it. They often just have to try different optimization techniques until they get it fast enough or the memory is small enough. So, optimization often moves into the crunch portion of game development. I'm not 100% sure what the solution to this is because better management isn't something that applies to this. I've never met a producer who could do crunt, who could do optimization better than a programmer, but I've also met very few programmers, if any. I don't think I've met any programmer that can properly estimate the time to optimize code. So right there, that tells me that there's something that's going to be unpredictable and how long it will take to achieve the target of fewer cycles, less memory, but will require extra time when you get to the end of your game's development. So good luck, people who think that can be managed away.

Now, one other thing is, optimization, as I've described here, is really part of programming, but design and art can help a great deal with this, with understanding what's expensive to ask for and what's cheap to ask for, and then self-limiting the expense of asks. A good example of that is, if your game's gonna have static and dynamic lighting, decide, do you really need that? Are there lots of lights that move around? Because static lighting is cheaper. If you're going to have a lot of dynamic lights, ask, how much are you going to have? Is there an upper limit of how many lights can be moving at once? Because that's also methods of lighting can be adapted depending on your answers to those questions. I know an example that happened in Fallout, the original Fallout, for the design optimization, is the original drug design. Every drug worked wildly different than every other drug. The effects were different, how long they lasted, not just length, but the number of effects they could have, and the type of effects they had, and it was going to be so complex to code, it would have taken months. And I remember suggesting and working with the lead designer to come up with a new generic drug system, which was here is a set of effects drugs can have. They can vary the effects per drug, they can vary the length of time, they can make different um time periods where they happen, so that way you can take a drug, and you get one effect, and then after a while, you get another effect, and then maybe after a while, you get a third effect. You can have drugs that maybe make you really perceptive, but then when the drug starts to wear off, you get really weak, and then they everything goes back to normal. You can even make drugs that have permanent effects, but I just, they do something, and then they do something else, and it never comes back to to balance. However, once we had that generic drug system, it worked great, and it worked for all drugs. So after that, lots of drugs could be created with pure data, and the code was fine.

So I guess my final word on optimization, for all of the people in management and non-programmers, is please listen to your coders when they describe how things are going to be made and then optimized. Keep in mind that many programmers are introverts, so just try to listen extra hard. I know that has saved me on many of my projects, and I also try to speak extra clearly when I'm talking about optimization of my own code. So I hope that helped you all understand exactly what is going on when your programmers say, "I need to optimize this piece of code."

Organizing Game Code.md

https://youtu.be/mmt9mB7HAwU?si=zOZfSi1YsLw-tO-y

Hi everyone, it's me Tim. Today I want to talk about how I structure code, and I don't really mean like I'm going to break down code into structures. I'm going to talk about how I do the code for a game in stages: when I do it, what I do first, what I make sure is done first. It'll be it'll make sense when I start talking, which is right now.

So first of all, I don't start any code until enough design is done. And whether I'm doing the design or someone else is doing the design, you shouldn't rush in and start code until you at least know some basic things like how big are your maps going to be, how are you going to be traversing them, do you want buildings and dungeons to be instanced or not, are we going to support flying or swimming. Like really fundamental things like that that the designer probably can just go, "I got the answer for you." I mean, it'd be great to have it written down with design pillars, but before you do anything, I like to have some really fundamental information like that decided on.

**Level Design**

The next thing that usually gets done, I haven't done this in all my games, but I think I've done it in every game I've made since 2004. So I've been doing this for 19 years. You make a simple level, we caught it, I considered the level of units. You basically make a level which anyone can go to — artist, programmer, designer — and see what your game's expectations are in terms of its most fundamental units. For example, you may have a ledge and that ledge is labeled, "This is the highest ledge that the player can jump to in a state while standing, you know, and land on their feet." Maybe it's a lower than that, and then there's a higher one saying, "This is the highest ledge that a player can jump up to and pull themselves up to." You may have an event and say, "This is the smallest, lowest vent that a player can crouch and move into." You may have like a bar and go, "This is the lowest bar a player can crouch to move under." You may have a spot for the player to stand and then have a creature and say, "This is the farthest away a creature can stand and still be hit by a player here with their melee weapon." You may have an example of a ladder, you may have an example of stairs, you may have an example of "This is the steepest angle that the player can't move up." You put all these in for a couple of reasons. One, you want everyone to see what your limits are so that way if an artist is making something and you know like this is a canyon and the designer said you can't climb the walls, he knows how the well, it wasn't going to be perfectly vertical, vertical they can be angled, but he knows how far the angle can be before it becomes something the player can walk up. It also lets you see things, sometimes you just need to see how far away is the farthest person I can melee, and you may go, "I think that's too close. I think we want to make melee have a slightly longer range." And sometimes it just helps to have one of these unit rooms to do it, and you want to make that soon because some of these will change as you're developing, but you want them locked in as soon as possible because if you change the highest distance you can jump to or the steepest angle that the player can still walk, if you change that later in the game, lots of stuff has to be changed. So you want to do that soon.

Then the very first thing I always code is just someone moving around the world, walking, running, whatever, and this is usually just with terrain. This is the time where you decide is the speed approach feel appropriate, the viewpoint, how high up above the ground I am, what FOV we're going to pick. A lot of these are pretty standardized now, but they didn't used to be, and even then, people still argue on what a good speed and FOV should be. If you saw the Fallout demo with the Knight walking around the trees and the flowers, that's a perfect example of one of the very earliest things I did, even before there was — I think there were only two people on the Fallout team besides me, the two Jasons, and that was made just because we — I wanted to knock out, "This is what isometric, this is how far the camera's pulled back, this is how fast the person walks, this is about how big trees and terrain objects will be."

**Props**

The next thing you do after making that is you start on more complex terrain and putting in like the steep mountains, you actually put in some mountains and some canyons, water pits, and then you walk around that, and you see how it looks like. How what does an open pit look like, is it easy to see as I approach it, does it, can I, can it, does it visually make sense, here's a pit I could jump over, does it make sense when I'm doing it. If not, you may want to go back to your unit test and say, "This is how far the player jumps," and you may want to pull it in a little bit. The next thing that tends to be made, and by this time, you have other people on the team, is you ask for things like props. Props are trees, shrubs, ground clutter. Ground clutter's like grasses and flowers that you move through. Props are not intended for the player to walk on or for NPCs to walk on. They can have collision, they can have attachment points like if you want to make a tree and there's attachment points where birds will land here and then go off, you can put, you can put that on a prop if you want. Trees to block the player so the trunk blocks the player but maybe the branches don't. Props can have collision volumes, some props have no collision volumes, no shrubs you could just walk through, maybe grass and flowers you just walk through, maybe they detect the player and do a bend or whatever so it looks really cool when you're walking through the grass, but they're not intended to stop you.

**Structures**

The next stage you would do is you'd code structures. Structures are intended to be walked on and not just by the player, you expect players and NPCs to walk on them. So not only do they have collision, but they have pathing for the player and the NPC to walk on. These are things like buildings, especially especially if they're not instanced, so you can walk into them, be on the roof, be on second floors, ruined buildings, maybe big boulders or outcroppings, ships, boats, start plate spaceships, whatever you're making in your game. Also, structures include things like dungeons because they have pathing and collision. The only difference is this is a structure that you tend to instance into. And remember, one of the first questions you asked your designer is, "Are we going to support instancing and how often are we going to instance?" So you should already have that question, so now when you make these structures, you

 should have a good idea of roughly maybe how big the biggest extent they will be, whether they will instance from level to level, or you need to be able to support those levels, how big your pathing mesh may be because these are all things you're going to need to know as a programmer.

**Maps and Exploration**

The next thing I do, now that I've got all that stuff done, I try to handle instancing, which is the entering and exiting of different maps. Sometimes the map is a pure structure like a dungeon, sometimes or ship, sometimes it's going from a terrain area to another terrain area because you go through a mountain pass, and it's an instance into the next zone, which then brings you to maps. Now your game has to support maps, how are you going to allow travel on them, are you going to do fast travel, are you, do you always instance when you go from one map to another, or you ever have two maps that are stored separately and but you can go from one of the other without an instance, are you going to have a really big map that has to be streamed in sections because it's so large. You get that worked out.

The next thing I tend to do code-wise is support basic exploration. This means the player can now move around this world, jump up on things, maybe there are switches that can control doors or gates or draw bridges, so now you have things that have like here's something that has collision and pathing but it changes its location. You have activatable items in the world that have to have a state. You start to add items in the world, so now there's an item, now the player can pick those up, oh well now you need inventory and containers so you can have chests with items, and then that leads you to putting in creatures because creatures have inventory too, so when they, you kill them, you can loot them. Oh, but now there's combat, and now there's vendors. It very rapidly, when you start exploration, grows into all the other areas: combat, merchants, dialogues with people. So at this point, UI tends to begin in parallel and grows along with everything else you're doing. Usually, it starts with, "Hey, can we get a simple start, quit menu, can we get some settings menu?" Because already early in development, people are going to go, "Could I have settings to make combat easier, harder, or turn it off?" And things like that. There's often settings in early games that go away, they're not shipped, they're not intended to be shipped. Some of those are put in consoles, and that's that way you can triply hide it when the game shifts by disabling the console. That's why so many games have console activation.

**Load and Save**

At this point, you start thinking about load and save, both how you're going to handle it and what the UI is going to be like. Some maybe load and save is done at checkpoints, maybe you can load and save anywhere, maybe you can load save anywhere as long as you're not in combat. These decisions have to be made so load and save can be programmed and the UI made for it. That makes sense. Inventory UI, looting UI, because remember, you've now put items in the game, people are going to want some way to wield them or carry them around. You start dialogue, bartering, all those are for you are things that you need now that you have creatures in the game, you want to be able to do more than just fight them. AI to control all this has to be done. This is the stage where it really tends to go boom, and all these things are now being done in parallel, so it's hard to say this one's done before this one.

**Coding Practices**

So the last advice I want to give, I'm going to talk about when I actually write code, there's a couple of things that I want to talk about. One, I have five functions that have appeared in every class or module depending on what code you're doing, basically some unified set of methods and variables. I'm going to just pretend I'm talking about C++. So for every class, I always had five functions. I call them init, reset, exit, load, and save. Here's what they're for. Init is what's called on that class when the game first starts, not a new game, just a game. You, when the game begins up, it calls that class and said, "You need to do anything?" This is something that's, if in C++, would be called from the constructor. We didn't have constructors in C, so I just had a function called init. Exit is the same thing except when the game shuts down, it had, it caused everything says, "Hey, if you had memory, if there's file handles, just, you got to release those things." Those are usually called from the destructor in C++. Then there's that, the other one though that I mentioned in between, reset. Reset gets called whenever the player starts a new game within the game. So when you stuck new game from the main menu, it calls reset and all those things. So basically, it means if you exist class, you have to reset yourself to something fundamental because maybe somebody's playing a game like, "I don't like this. I want to start a new game." So you clear out the quest log, you clear out their XP, you reset all their attributes and skills. That would happen in the reset for those classes.

**Load and Save**

Load and save, I know a lot of people don't have that. What they do is they destruct all those things and then construct new ones. I didn't like doing that because that often fragments memory badly. It's not as a big biggest of worry now, it's a huge worry for most of my career. And then the last two were load and save. Load and save were basically methods that would be called on your class when a save game is occurring and would usually handle, hand you a file handle and say, "Whatever you need to save, save after this file handle." But save it in a way that when I call your load, you can load just what you need and leave the file handle set to just pass what you had. So what it tended to do is let's say you had three variables you wanted to save, you would write out, if you knew there was always those three, you would just write, write them out, boom, boom, boom, and then the load would read them in, boom, boom, boom, simple. But unless you had an array and you weren't sure how big the array was, what you do is you write out the size of the array, like there's five things in this one, then you read in those five values, and that's how you'd save it like that, and then you, you'd read it, you read a number, go, "I've got to read five things, boom, boom." Well, you initialize the array and and then put the numbers in.

**Keep Method Small**

I did this because frequently the person who's the programmer tasked with load save doesn't know how to load save every single thing in the game. He doesn't know how to load and save a dungeon or a creature or a creature happens to be

 a merchant, you know, who inventory may have changed dramatically. You know, there's a lot of things that are different per group, so I let the person who made that thing handle the load save, and all they knew is, "I got a file handle. I'd handle the load tape," and then what was what's great about that was later on when we made loads and saves that went into a database of loads and saves, you could get, you were getting something that looked like a file handle and acted like a file handle, but you were actually writing into a database. And then finally, the last recommendation I have for programming is, I tried to keep my method small, hopefully fitting on one screen. And I know that's vague because you may have a higher resolution screen, but that's the point. If you can see your entire function or method on one screen, I think it helps with the coding process. I know I broke that and something like pillars where I said I had a switch statement that was, I think it had hundreds of entries, and it was just a giant switch statement with hundreds of case statements. Not proud of that code. That was the first thing I told Brian McIntosh, you might want to refactor that on Deadfire. But I try to keep my method small. If a method gets too big, you can often think about why is it so big, what's it doing, how can I break this up into smaller methods. And I would use

**Outro**

And my battery gave out in the middle of that, but I was at the end, so I hope that answers a lot of questions about how I organize and begin coding a game and a little bit about how I literally structure code. And I'll keep an eye on my battery level in the future.

Pacifism In Games.md
Youtube Link:
https://youtu.be/I5-TCLLR2kQ?si=GbrsPTo0g1r4PFzg

Hi everyone, it's me Tim, and today I want to talk about pacifism in games. This comes from a question from am Brandt 7422 who asks, "I wonder what you think about pacifist play styles and how much implementing one costs on development time."

So again, T DW, I love PL pacifist playthroughs and they shouldn't take much extra work, if any at all, to support. But before I dive into this, though, two quick things. YouTube changed the algorithm again, so I have almost no control over ads anymore. You may have heard about this, but I can't control if they're at the beginning or the end or if they're skippable. The only thing I can control is whether or not I want them to be in the middle of the video, and I've turned that off, and that is the one control I still have, sorry. The other thing is it's so dark that I ordered some lights to put in my bookcase. They should be here today or tomorrow, so let's hope the next video is brighter.

Back to pacifism. I think it should be obvious I love pacifism playthroughs. You could play Fallout that way. It was accidental in Fallout. Somebody we designed the game and done the main quest and all that, and at one point, I believe someone in QA went, "You know, you can play without killing anybody?" and I was like, "Really?" and it turned out it was a side effect of most of the dialogue playthroughs didn't result in anyone dying. Caveat, you didn't kill anyone if the master blew up a bomb or if while stealthing around a bomb went off, that can't be blamed on you, right?

So once we knew that was happening, we kind of supported it, and I think I mentioned this, there was someone else who played the game who tried to kill everybody, and he was really upset that there seemed to be people marked as unkillable like the overseer, which is why we even threw in being able to kill him at the end.

Pacifism, spoiler after Fallout, pacifism was something that went into the design. We thought about it. It was a thoughtful design feature in my subsequent games, at least in the games that I could do it. Games where I was using someone else's IP, like Temple of Elemental Evil or Vampire: Bloodlines, we couldn't always control whether or not a pacifist playthrough is possible, but in the games I made myself that were my IP, I wanted pacifism to be possible.

So just so you know, pacifism, there's nothing special about pacifism in that sense. It's I like all kinds of player-driven character activity where you're doing something, you're behaving a certain way because you want to, not because the game's making you, not because it's optimal, but because you've decided that's part of your character.

My video a few weeks ago, I was talking about all my brother's miniatures and the associated characters. I remember those characters 44 years later because they are so memorable. He played his Illusionist in a way that was not the best for an Illusionist to announce, "I'm an Illusionist, and now I'm casting an illusion," but I remember that character. He was very distinct, and he was very successful. That's a good character.

Most people think the only way to measure your reward in an RPG is how high your character got level-wise or how many quests you completed. Wrong. It's how much fun you're having and how memorable that character is. Those are far, far better rewards, and 44 years later, I remember my brother's characters.

When I played started playing WoW in 2005, within a year or two, I remember a friend of mine, Miriam. She played a mage who was a vegan octogenarian, and I remember this character. It has been 20 years, and I remember her character because she was vegan. She wouldn't eat any animal products, and she was a mage. She could summon a lot of things. She could summon milk, but she wouldn't drink it. She could summon cheese, but she wouldn't eat it. She would only drink water. For some spells, it said summons a banquet. I think she let herself eat from it. She said, "Hey, okay, I'm eating from this, but I'm sure there's fruits and vegetables on here." The octogenarian part, the only place I remember that coming into play, was she turned run off on her character. Her character walked everywhere. So she was an 80-something-year-old mage who was vegan. That was a very distinctive set of layers on top of a standard mage character and something I remember.

I had a character too, a little gnome called Nugget, and when he got high enough level, his last name became O'Justice. So he was Nugget O'Justice, and his tagline was he avenged those who couldn't avenge themselves. Basically, he got really excited when there was a quest that some poor farmer was being put upon, or someone stole money or whatever, and he's like, "Yes, this is what we're going to do." He was relatively neutral about quests like we're going to go into some dungeon and collect treasure, but if there was a bad guy in the dungeon and he had stolen that treasure or he was doing bad things like raising the dead, Nugget O'Justice was going to take care of it.

I like stuff like that. To me, pacifism is that. It is a player feeling so strongly about not killing someone, even in a game, that he makes that part of his character's background and story and behavior, and that makes the games harder to play. When you play a pacifist, if you're playing a game that gives you experience for killing, you're not going to get that XP. It's one of the many reasons I like XP just coming from quests because that way, the game isn't judging you on how you solved the quest, just that you did it.

And I also love that people sometimes want to experience the storyline in an RPG, and they want to play through all the stories and meet all the characters and see the outcomes and see the effects on people, but they don't necessarily want to do all the combat. I had a friend who was a level designer, and he primarily played games to see the story and to see the levels, and he would often turn difficulty, especially combat difficulty, down to easy, so he could do that.

What I love about pacifism is that's a way, if the game provides it, it's a way to do that without having to turn any game difficulty down to low. You can play it. The game provides a way of doing it. I love that.

So let's talk about how you would put that into your game's design. I do not think the development time has to be increased if you plan for pacifism in advance. My games, on all the main story quests, had a rule that those quests had to be, you could fight your way through, sneak your way through, or talk your way through. Yes, sometimes the talk path ended up with people fighting among themselves, or someone fighting for

 you, or doing something violent. And yes, sometimes the sneak one was going in, hacking into a computer, and having it blow up an engine, or sneaking into a bomb and activating it. So yes, that was you being violent, even if it's by proxy, but there were lots of options that didn't have that, where you could just not even interact with people. You sneak in, you get what you want, you leave.

So if your game has options like that, you just need to make sure that in any quest that has a, if the sneak option is violent, the talk one isn't. The talk one's violent, the sneak one isn't. And usually, the talk ones aren't violent, so you usually can get away with that. So if what you have to say is, to be a pacifist character, you maybe have to put some points in talking, I don't think that's out of the question to tell players, "We support pacifism, but you're going to have to have good speech skills."

So because I already had those stealth and dialogue paths already planned for my games, it's not like they increase our development time. We were already going to do it. So I believe the only place it really came into planning, once we realized we wanted pacifist paths, is when you had placed encounters that required combat that would violate my rule if there was no way around them, if it funneled you into this thing, and you had to fight this guy. At the end of Outer Worlds, that's why I was always against bosses. I didn't really like the robot, but you could, with advanced planning, get the robot heavily reduced and get the drones to fight for you and get your companions to fight, and you could actually not do anything, and you could defeat the robot. Plus, it was a robot, so I'm not sure that counted on many people's pacifism playthroughs. I mean, if you were allowed to shoot a gun turret, the robots in Outer Worlds were not sentient. You should be allowed to kill them.

Now, all bets are off on side quests, random encounters. Like I've said, side quests didn't have to have all three playthroughs, which meant you might have a side quest that only has a combat solution. Pacifists aren't going to do that, but side quests are optional, so the game is completable with pacifism, and I feel like it supports that playthrough.

Now, the one thing I said, placed encounters, uh, and side quests, one thing that isn't optional or avoidable are random encounters. However, you can do things to make random encounters handleable in a pacifist playthrough. First of all, they could be escapable. There could be a perk saying you can opt out of random encounters in the world map, you know, you're so good at tracking and being an outdoorsman that you can see something coming and just avoid it.

In Fallout, we let you run from every encounter, so they could be shooting at you, but once you reach the transition grid, you're taken out of the map, even if you're in combat. So they're escapable.

Other things are perks that make hostile creatures not hostile, especially animals, or perks that let you have dialogue with hostile people and potentially make them back down, even if you have to pay them money. So those are all ways that random encounters could be handleable by pacifist. Yeah, you may have to run away. Yeah, you may have to pay money, but that's kind of the balance between if you don't want to kill anyone, that's what you have to do.

So I think with those kinds of rules in place, almost any RPG could be made to support pacifist playthroughs. Not sure about MMORPGs, especially. I'm not sure what it says ethically about you being in a party and everyone else is fighting things, and you're not, although I pretty much described healers, especially in raids. They pretty much just keep everybody buffed and healed, and they're not actually directly damaging the boss, so there are even things like that.

But I think most games, most RPGs, if they're rich enough, can easily support pacifist playthroughs, and I like that mine did. So, am Brandt 7422, I hope that answers your question.

Perfect Is The Enemy Of Good.md

https://youtu.be/6bOe2JH5FZw?si=wBxR5cGiEAaL189e

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim. Today, I want to talk about a common phrase I hear in the industry called "perfect is the enemy of good." I think I didn't hear this until about mid-2000s when I was at Carbine. This is a phrase that basically means the time you take to make a feature perfect will take away time from making other features good, and it's commonly given as a warning that you shouldn't spend too much time on any one feature if you're not bringing all the other features up to parity with it. Sometimes I've heard this as an excuse to get rid of features early when you can't make them good enough.

I think it's a good idea, by the way, I'm gonna immediately go off on a tangent. I think it's a good idea if you want to remove a feature to do that as early as possible. I've met a lot of people, among them producers, who think that removing a feature is as easy as just going, "Okay, that feature is gone now. We delete it. I'll delete it from all future schedules. Oh good, we're done." Most games, especially RPGs, the features are like threads that form a fabric, and you can't just easily delete one.

I'll give you an example. Let's say you were making an RPG and you decide to delete crafting. Well, you can't just remove crafting without removing everything that's associated with crafting, including the objects that it would create, the items that are dropped to support crafting like crafting materials or recipes. Now some of you may go, "Oh, you can drop them anyway, it's just, you know, the crafting materials are now junk you can sell." Well, now that's items that exist only to be sold, not to be used in some other way. Also, what would crafting recipes be if you just left them in the game and you're finding all these recipes for something you can't do? So, you at least have to delete that. But it also causes a problem with item economy because one of the ways I used to balance, try to balance I should say, item economy is by having all the sources of items in the game and use that to change up where some of the best items are available throughout the game. So, sometimes the best item is at a merchant. Sometimes the best items are as a quest drop and sometimes it's crafting. Well, if you delete crafting as a source of items, suddenly you've lost one of your sources of items in the game. Those those cut rows of best items that are that are at the levels that they're currently available via crafting now have to be made to be available somewhere else, and you have to figure out how to do that so they're only available at those levels. If you just throw them in a merchant's inventory and a player with a lot of money can buy it early, you've kind of defeated the whole point of how your economy is going to work.

But anyway, I wanted to walk through examples of where "perfect is the enemy of good" affected my games. *Outer Worlds* is a good example of a game where a lot of features were dropped during the development because we could not get them up to the quality level we wanted, either they were dropped or they're reduced to fall backs. I kept a huge list of fallback features for *Outer World* so that at any time, I could we could go, "Oh, we're not going to be able to get the feature to this, let's replace it with this easier, faster, simpler feature." But some of them were just outright removed because that way because we couldn't get them the quality level we wanted, or bug-free, we just decided to take them out of the game. An example I like to talk about all the time is Monarch. Monarch was originally designed to be four times the size it is in the shipping game. It was designed as a the Lawless jungle planet. It remained Lawless, but we lost the jungle for various reasons. But the intention of it was I wanted you to have a big open world to constantly explore, to go out into, to test new weapons, to find monsters, just to wander around. There's going to be a lot of respawning, there's gonna it was just supposed to be a huge like open sandboxy area. When it got when we got removed, not only did we lose those qualities, but we lost a big hit to play time. We thought Monarch would easily provide an additional five to ten hours of play time just in terms of exploration and combat, so all that was lost.

"Perfect is the enemy of good" is often a warning about early optimization. I should have mentioned this in the optimization video I did previously, but one danger is that a lot of programmers like to do is they like to get their code, when they finish writing it, they optimize it right then, the idea being, "Hey, I just wrote this, it's fresh in my mind, I know ways of optimizing it." There's a lot of dangers in doing early optimization, and some of the big ones are, remember optimization, they do speeding up the code or reducing its memory footprint. Speeding up code that turns out isn't called very often anyway is a complete waste of time. If you have some code that is barely ever called, it's not going to make a huge impact in your profile of the game if you make it faster. Similarly, I've seen programmers speed up code that never is that slow to begin with. You know, if you have a, if you use a really bad sorting algorithm on an array that's never going to be bigger than five, A) it doesn't really matter what sorting algorithm you use and B) why are you even sorting it, why not just walk through it and find the highest number, smallest number, whatever it is you're looking for? But I've seen programmers do that, and that kind of early optimization to quote "make it perfect" took away time that they go to spend on other things. Another example is reducing the memory footprint of something, and I talked about you know places where people kept a whole Ray around, they create an array just to grab one small thing off the, the just to sort it, grab something off and then throw the arrayway, but if you reduce the memory footprint of something that's created to make a calculation and then gives that memory back for garbage collection, you don't really need to worry about that memory. If a function is called and to do its work, it needs to look at several things and it creates an array of those things, does its calculations by multiple walks through that array and then throws their way array into the garbage collection heap, that's fine. I've seen people try to optimize that by saying, "Well, I'll grab an array that I keep globally so I don't have to keep reallocating it," especially if this is something that's not called that frequently, if it doesn't grab that much memory, if it goes right back into the garbage collection heap and you have a really good garbage collection algorithm that gives you back memory chunks that you need to reuse, don't worry about it. That's a perfect example of optimizing too early.

The other example I wanted to give, though, of an example of something I never got around to doing because of an optimization, and I've talked about this in

 a few places, but we spent a lot of time in original *Fallout* making sure that the walking animations didn't float, and by that I mean when they move, the footprints, their footsteps connect to the ground and then when they move to the next footstep, footstep, the foot that's on the ground doesn't slide. In a lot of isometric games, you see them slide as they walk. We didn't want that at *Fallout*. It took a lot of time and effort from both me and the artists to make sure that happened. It had to be rendered in a very particular way with a very particular focal distance and lens in, we're using Maya or Alias, particular algorithms in in the game and how the art was cut out, put in the game, and then the animation was done. Took a lot of time to put in something that a lot of people don't even ever notice. So, what didn't get done? Well, I'm sure if you'll play *Fallout*, you'll notice that because they only walk from hex to hex, when you go vertically, they walk in a very jerky way like this. One back burner thing I had to that I wanted to do that I never got to do was when you clicked on the destination, if it determined that there was a path there along the hexes, it would just walk you in a straight line there so it looked smooth. It would look better even though maybe they're the angle because we only had so many sprite rotations, wouldn't be perfect, they would just walk there, but they'd be walking partially out of hexes that hadn't been checked for blocking, which meant they might clip slightly through a doorway or clip slightly through scenery, but it probably would have looked better because they wouldn't have done that jerky walk up and up and down, and especially on things where most of the walk was along the hex path anyway, it would have looked great, you wouldn't have had any of those issues, and it would have looked much better, never had time to do that. If you play *Temple of Elemental Evil*, its animations look way better, it's walking animations look way better because when you click somewhere, we take you right there, and because it's a 3D character, we have no trouble rotating them to directly where you want to go, and it kind of works that way in that it determines the path is free in that direction, but then walks you as smoothly as possible in angles to get you where you're going, looks way better, kind of wish I had done some something similar in the original *Fallout*, didn't have time. Why? Because it spent so much time getting those footsteps working, which my guess is 95 percent of the people playing didn't notice and didn't care, and I based on the fact that so many other isometric games that were contemporaneous with us, like *Diablo*, didn't bother, no one noticed, no one cared. So, I'm basically throwing this out as a cautionary tale of, and this is mainly the programmers, but it can be for artists and designers as well, if you spend so much time trying to get one thing perfect, you're going to lose time and everything else. You would rather have a game of everything being good and instantly good then a couple perfect things, a few good things, and then some bad things. Trust me, I've made way too many games that are packed full of features, I'm looking at you, *Arcanum*, that never got polished enough. They're not, I wouldn't even call them good because we were worried about making too many other things perfect. So just keep that in mind if you're doing game development, that perfect is the enemy of good.

Player Agency.md

https://youtu.be/OoJ6CDDfYiU?si=6XlrkVZok_ddhTdW

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim, and let's start off the new year by talking about player agency. Now, what do I mean by player agency? Player agency is that when a game allows the player to choose what to do, and then the game reacts, especially the storyline of the game. Player agency, the opposite of this would be when a game has a predefined, very narrow set of things the player can do, even though it feels like he should be able to do other things, and the storyline is predictable and unchangeable. You're basically, as the player, you're just there for the ride. I think to anybody who's played any of my games, you know that I'm all for as much player agency as possible.

Now, player agency is not binary. You don't have a game that either has player agency or doesn't. Usually, it's a continuum of things. And let me give you an example. Let's say you're playing a game where you run around a world doing things, and you only have one weapon, the one you start with. That's very limited agency. A little more agency is you can find different weapons, and you can switch between them. Now you have a player who can decide what weapon he wants to use. Maybe there're skills for the different weapons, so now there's even more interesting player agency because there's choice for what skill you want to use. Maybe the skills even unlock things you can do with those weapons. And then you can choose what weapons to use. Maybe you switch weapons when you're fighting monsters because some weapons are better than others. Even more agency.

So let's say you're running around the world. Let's say you're using a sword, and you're hitting things. Let's say you hit the wall. Okay, that's, you know, you do that. Let's say when you hit the wall, you hear a sound based on the material of your weapon and the material of the wall. That's interesting. Maybe it leaves a mark, a decal. That's even more interesting. That's just an additional way the game is reacting to what you're doing in a way that you know the designer expected you to do that. Maybe you can hit some things and break it. Maybe you can break through a door that way. Maybe you can break open a chest that way. That's even more agency because now, even though there were skills to pick locks, the game is saying, "I'll let you do this." Maybe it's not good for the weapon. Maybe weapons have damages on it, and it gets damaged a lot more when you use it for things like that. You can see even more decisions the designer made. Maybe when you break open chests, you get the things inside. Even more agency. Maybe sometimes, breaking open the chest breaks some of the things inside. Even more reaction to what you're doing. Maybe creatures nearby come to investigate the noise or get mad if they see you stealing things from their chest. Even more agency. Maybe the game story changes if you ever discovered to be a thief, whether it changes locally or globally. Wow, that's even more agency.

So, I hope I explained how a simple decision like "I can hold different weapons" created a whole continuum of player agency in a game. That's what I'm talking about, this continuum of player agency. I like pushing as far along that continuum as possible. Now, let me make something clear, though. I'm not talking about restrictions caused by the game engine, like it doesn't support maybe determining sound based on material, maybe it doesn't support different sound effects, maybe it doesn't support breaking geometry, or maybe your budget didn't support that. Maybe the engine supports it, but you just didn't have the animation budget to show things breaking apart like that or to show items in the world that maybe you can only get things out of containers because they're, you know, you can never show an item sitting on the ground. I'm not talking about those kinds of things. I'm by player agency. I'm talking about deliberate decisions made by the game's designer to allow certain things to happen or to restrict them from happening. And that's what I'm talking about because those deliberate decisions are what interests me. And when I'm playing a game, that's what I look for. Many people have asked what, how I play a game. I look for those deliberate design decisions because I call that the hand of the designer. I want to know what he or she is telling me. I want you to do this, but I don't want you to do this. This happens a lot in interfaces. If you ever use an interface and you pick up stuff and things go into different categories, that right there is a designer saying, "Hey, these things are used for different purposes. Let me divide those up into categories for you." And each category has a different purpose. If when you go to a vendor, they automatically have the button or something you can say to the vendor to sell all your junk items or whatever, obviously, that's what they thought you would do. If they didn't think you would do that, they wouldn't have spent the extra time to put that in the interface. And then sometimes, when those things are missing, like you can't walk up to a vendor and say, "Sell everything from this category," that's the designer saying, "I don't think you should ever want to do that."

So once I call that the hand of the designer, it's the obvious decisions that the designer made in the game, and he or she is telling you about those decisions through that design. So, let's talk about things that I like to see, elements of a game that I consider to increase player agency, at least, and these are things I like to put in mind. The first thing is that there are lots of different character builds you can make. I've stated that if you provide me a character, especially an already named character, I'm far less interested in your game. I want the game to be able to let me make as many different characters as possible in that character creator, and then I want the game to react to what I made. And I know people go, "Well, this leads a lot of people to min-max and stuff like that." I'm fine with that. If you want to make someone who's super, super strong and clumsy and stupid and, you know, has low health or whatever, what an interesting character. I want to see how long that character can survive. Related to that is, I love games that have lots of systemic options. In other words, ways to proceed through quests or the storyline that are not scripted, that are emergent behaviors and emergent reactions of the game based on code. In Fallout, it was things like when you pickpocketed things off players, it turns out because we reused the vendor interface, you could also place things in them. I noticed that. I was like, "I don't know why anybody would want to do that." Well, I told you, QA found something fun to do, which is taking grenades, pulling the pins, and putting it in someone else's inventory. I love that, not because I approve of the action, but because I love the fact that the systems that were designed allow the player to interact with the world in a way I never anticipated. Basically,

 it's additional player agency, and since I didn't plan for it, it's surprise player agency, and I love it.

Things like dialogue choices. If you've ever played a game and you want to be able to say something, and they don't give you anything near that in the responses, I don't like that. If I want to tell someone, "You're being a jerk," or "I'm not going to pay for this," "I don't know where you're going to get the money," I want to be able to say things like that. Different quest resolutions. This is something obviously I'm a big fan of, been doing it since Fallout, where we had combat solutions and stealth solutions and dialogue solutions, and then in Outer Worlds, I added leadership solutions, which is basically being able to do things through your companions that you otherwise wouldn't be able to do. Love that stuff. I especially love it when quest resolutions lead to different endings of the game, that the game monitors enough of the quests, and not just the very last quest you did, but monitors several of the quests you do, even if that means the last quest itself varies based on all the things that you did prior to that. I love that kind of stuff. I don't like it when a game says, "Oh, we're totally reactionary to the player," and what it does is, in the last 10 minutes of the game, it says, "Do you want to go A, B, or C?" It's like, gee, that's not exactly the player agency I had in mind. In fact, let's flip that and talk about things that reduce player agency. You could just say the opposite of everything I just said. You could say, "Well, not having a bunch of different character builds, not having a bunch of systemic options or dialogue choices or different ways of doing quests." Yes, those all reduce player agency, but I'm talking about a few extra things that, again, the designer deliberately did to restrict the player.

One would be any event in the game that's unavoidable, especially, I'm looking at cutscenes. I hate cutscenes that aren't skippable. But if a particular cutscene plays, which advances the story, always plays through the same way, no matter what I did, it makes me feel like I'm not really having much impact. Similarly, if there are events in the world that always have to be dealt with the same way, like when you get up to this bad person, you just always have to kill him. You can't take him into custody. You can't convince him of the error of his ways. You can't join him and go, "Hey, I approve of your evil ways. Let's be evil together." The game, to me, has a little less agency, and the continuum, it's a little farther to no agency, and I dislike it. As much along those lines, unkillable NPCs fall into that category for me. If you make a game where it appears like you can kill everybody, and everything you're killing dragons, it feels really weird that somebody back in town is completely able. Now, if you need someone to be around for a while, I understand having them talk to you through an intercom or calling you on your phone. But if you actually meet someone face to face, and you literally cannot kill them, I hate that because it's the hand of the designer smacking you in the face and saying, "Nope, I'm just not going to allow you to do that," even though everything that led up to this made you believe you could do it. In fact, that kind of reduced agency is what I hate the most. It's when the designer deliberately restricts you from something that you've been doing for hours because in that case, I believe the hand of the designer appears very clumsy. It's the designer basically forcing you to do something or to not be able to do something just because they want their game played a certain way. I'm not one of those designers who thinks a game should be played a certain way. I just feel like, okay, I will try to think of all the different ways you can do this, and I'll have the game react. The storyline will still proceed. It may just proceed in a very different direction. You may not like that direction, but guess what? You were the one who decided to kill these people or take their things or, you know, steal from the vendor or whatever. Those are things you decided to do, and now you have to live with the consequences.

So, let me sum up player agency. I love it. I think it's a continuum. I'm not talking about things that are budget or game restrictions. I'm talking about when a designer deliberately decides to allow or restrict the player from doing something. Personally, I love when you take that continuum and push things as far to the edge as you can, where you allow the player to do as much as he wants, and have those effects show up in the game. It encourages replayability. It's impressive when games react dramatically, and I think it makes the game that much more interesting. So, those are my thoughts on player agency.

Player Engagement.md

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim, and today I want to talk about player engagement.

## What is Player Engagement

Player engagement is what a game does to make the player feel more involved in gameplay, and I'm going to get into it, but I want to make two concepts clear first. First of all, player engagement is a very modern term. I think it started about 10 years ago, 15 tops. We didn't used to talk about player engagement. I defy you to find an interview about Fallout or any of the target games where we talk about player engagement. What we did instead is we thought about what was fun, what did we want to be able to do, what's a feature we've never seen in a game before, and then we added that. Player engagement is pretty modern, and it also coincides with something else, which I'm not going to talk about, but I want to distinguish player engagement from player addiction. Addiction is when a game performs or has features that not make the player feel more involved but make the player feel like there is a reward coming soon, so they need to keep playing. It's interesting, player engagement is fun, player addiction can feel frustrating. Both involve the player spending more time in the game, but what's interesting about addiction is, and you if you've watched my Randomness video and I talked about how often randomness is used in games, random reward is the most addicting reward strategy that there is. It has been studied on humans and animals, and it creates behaviors that are very hard to extinguish. Basically, random reward is when you just periodically give something that the subject wants. In the most famous experiment of this was pigeons were just given food pellets at completely random intervals. They found that not only did they wait by the food dispenser, but they would often start doing like little dances or head movements because pigeons, like humans, think the world revolves around them and thought they were doing something to make those food pellets come out, and that random reward to happen to coincide randomly with some behavior the pigeon was doing, so then they started doing it, and when it didn't work, they do it again, and they do it again, and eventually a pellet would come out because it was random, and then that locked in that behavior. By the way, if you couldn't tell, um, in addition to my computer science major as an undergraduate, I minored in Psych because I was going to go into AI. I thought that would help. Anyway, I had to study this a lot. Random reward strategy is used in many games, but it's most often used in games with ad revenue, like a lot of mobile games, because those games rely on the player coming back frequently to play and having long play sessions because both of those behaviors mean that there will be a lot of ads served, and that's how they make their money.

## Player Engagement, Not Player Addiction

So, let's talk about player engagement, not player addiction. So player engagement is making the player feel immersed, involved, wanting to interact with the game, not necessarily waiting for rewards, but just, "I like what I'm doing. I'm going to do that a lot." There's a bunch of ways you can increase player engagement. The best one I've ever found is just to have several different types of gameplay, and this is separate from different kinds of player builds. I mean, you could make a stealth character or a combat character. What I'm talking about is if the game you're making can have the player do different things, maybe they can do combat, maybe they do exploration where they find cool stuff, maybe they can talk with interesting NPCs, maybe they're collecting things, maybe they're crafting things. All these are different types of gameplay that have different rhythms and enjoyment, and no player likes all of them, but most players like most of them, and so if your game can include those and then swap among them fairly regularly, players won't get bored. If it's just combat, combat, combat, players will get bored, but if it's combat, oh now you get to explore this area, oh those are those things I was trying to collect because if I collect all 10, I get some cool reward, they start doing that, oh wait I just found a recipe and I have most of the ingredients, I'm gonna craft something, those kind of things create player engagement because they're interesting, they're different, they're fun, and they all have their own rewards at the end, and they may have different reward periods, some of them you rewarded seconds after you engage the behavior, others require minutes or hours, and sometimes even days.

## Combat

I remember learning this lesson even in combat. You saw it a lot in the early MMOs like EverQuest. They had things called trash mobs, which you could just kill very easily, and then it lit up the bosses, which would require sometimes groups or multiple groups for raids to take down that boss. Having that variation, that huge spectrum in combat, that alone made combat more interesting. One problem I ran into in WildStar was one of the other devs wanted to just make everything bosses. He goes, "Look, people love bosses, let's just all do bosses." And that's where I said my phrase, which I know I've put in another video, about people like roller coasters much more than monorails. It doesn't matter how high up the monorail is, it's still a monorail, so if you made a game of all bosses, it's not gonna be as fun. I know Shadows of the Colossus was all bosses, but there's a lot of riding on your horse in between them, and every boss was very different. So, having a bunch of things to do in your game is great. As the game progresses, you should always introduce new things to do. For example, for combat, you could have combat mechanics that don't unlock until later in the game, such as you know, skill combinations or abilities that when you get them to a certain level, unlock new things you can do with them. This means that the player who's used to combat suddenly has anything he can do in combat, maybe after three regular swings, he can do a power swing, maybe after three swings, he can do a cleave and hit multiple creatures at once. That brings a whole new level of tactics to this combat that they're already used to doing. Ability unlocks are the same way. In Outer Worlds, as you went up levels, you were encouraged to spend points in single skills because they unlocked more things that skill could do. This meant that even though the player was already using that skill, he could suddenly use it to do more things, or he could get more fun out of using the skill, more variety. That's the great thing about those skill unlocks and new combat mechanics. They create more variety and therefore give you more types of play and more things you can switch between to create that player engagement.

## Mysteries

I also think it's important, and this is just a personal thing, but I think the players should often have a choice in what to do. One thing that I think improves engagement is when the player, he could do combat, or he could sneak by it, or he could talk to the thing. Just the fact that when you approach this NPC, you have these options and what you want to do

 creates an interesting engagement in itself because the players being told, "Your agency is important, and you need to decide, and that's going to change what's happening going forward." Another really good way of introducing player engagement is to have mysteries in the game. Things that the player hears about, gets a clue about, isn't exactly sure what's going on, and starts to investigate it. Now those could be done in different levels. You could have quest-level mysteries where when you start a quest, you're not sure what's going on, and then when the quest resolves, you're like, "Oh, I see, they were a vampire," or "Oh, I get it, they went exploring the dungeon and they died, that's why they never came back." But you can also have story-level mysteries. It's like, "Why are these corporations acting this way? That doesn't seem like in their best interest." "Oh, they know that food doesn't have enough nutrition, and they're, they don't know how to solve it, so they're misdirecting it with by putting out lots of snacks that make people feel full, and they don't realize they're slowly starving to death." Those are the kind of mysteries you can put in the game, and sometimes don't solve them all. The Outer Worlds mystery of what happened to Earth is still a mystery at the end of the game. That's great. That forms a kind of player engagement that may make people want to play a sequel where you can solve that mystery and introduce new ones. That's the kind of onion-level storytelling that I like to do.

## Challenge

Another way to increase player engagement is with challenge. Now, challenge is making the player feel like the game is constantly throwing things at them that are hard to do, and they have to figure out like, how are all my skills and abilities and perks, what combination of them do I need to do to get past this challenge. This is hard to do because it's really the balance, and let's just be frank, I'm not that good at balance. I often relied on other people to help me balance my games because of that. I think it's especially hard in the games I make because there are so many player builds. Trying to make balance and therefore challenge for all those different player builds are very difficult. What's hard for a dialogue character may be really easy for a combat character. So that kind of challenge is hard to put in a lot of RPGs. I think it's possible. I think one way to do it is to make challenging side quests because like I said, since the main story quests have to be done by every player build, they're necessarily tuned to the weakest build that a player can make, but they still have to get through those main story quests, and then you can make the side quests challenging, and the side quest can be really rewarding with items and crafting recipes and XP in a way the main story quests don't have to be because the main story quests are their own reward.

## Fail

And then the final thing about player engagement that's important to talk about is when the player fails, when he tries to do something and isn't successful, you have to make sure that your game always makes this the fault of the player and not the game. Players will look for reason in your game is at fault. I talked about it in the randomness video where they missed three times in a row with a 95% chance of hit, and they were convinced the random number generator was wrong, yet you can play D&D and roll three ones in a row, and you know it's your fault, although even then I've seen people go, "My dice are bad. These are bad dice." I knew somebody used to when he got bad rolls, he'd put the dice back in the little plastic container and isolate them. He said they were in dice jail for a while. That's a perfect play of people always find a way of blaming anyone but themselves, but you need to make sure your game, as much as possible, shows that it's the player's fault. I think Nintendo does a great job of this. When you're playing Super Mario World, they're perfected side scroller, whenever you fail, you always knew it was because, "Oh, I didn't jump out of the way of that thing," or "I mistimed jumping over the chasm," or "I didn't put up my shield or duck or whatever." You, it always feels like it's your fault. The problem I have with a lot of online games is once you start playing an online game, there's always that worry that other people will be using cheats, there's always the worry that lag is the reason you didn't, you know, "Like, I shot that guy before he shot me," because of lag, you both may have seen yourself shoot first, so there's a lot of ways that games like that can appear that it's not your fault, which is then frustrating the player, which then reduces player engagement.

So, these are my thoughts on player engagement, pretty much. Have several types of gameplay, swap among them, extend them, introduce new ways of doing things, make sure the player has the choice and what to do it, that there's challenge, and that if the player ever fails at something, they know it's because of something they did, so they can immediately replay and try something else. I think if you do all these things, you can get a highly engaging game without having to dip into all that player addiction stuff I mentioned at the beginning.

Player Hoarding.md

https://youtu.be/ESVby0UG-Ao?si=dsTGCt-4D1GiZpF1

Hi everyone, it's me Tim, and today I want to talk about player hoarding. Mr. awesome 5211 asks what suggestions would you have regarding player hoarding when it comes to items and skills throughout the game. That's a good question. And I know, I know, everyone's had the experience where they end a game and they have a thousand heal potions or that one Scroll of Doom that you were waiting for just the right moment to use. Or you had a heal entire party spell that you never cast because you never came across a point where everyone in the party was hurt. Everybody hoards. Every game I think I've ever played, I've hoarded something, and there are some people who just can't stop hoarding. It's what they do, and some of those people even like hoarding. I don't think all of them do. I think some people hoard and they wish they didn't, but they hoard anyway.

But I think what we can do is look at game design to encourage players not to do that, and I think we got to look at two different things. You talk about items and skills, and I'm going to assume for skills, you meant hoarding as in not using them because they had a limit on how often you could use them, and so you just saved it until a perfect moment.

So let's talk about items first because I think that's easier to comprehend and easier to talk about and happens in every game. I think games that drop things that are usable make people want to wait for the perfect time to use them. I've mentioned this before, but Breath of the Wild solved this issue by their weapons decayed with use and eventually break, and then you just had to use another one. This is a way that forced you to just keep getting more weapons and be glad you got more weapons and lose the ones that broke.

A lot of games have encumbrance. Most of my games use this. There's a reason for encumbrance. It makes the player drop things. It makes them keep what they think is usable and throw out the rest. A lot of people don't like encumbrance. They find it too restrictive, but every time you've experimented with the idea of getting rid of encumbrance, we just shift the problem to another part of the game, which is inventory. If people can get a lot of things, they then complain that they have a lot of things and that they can't get through their inventory. So then we try to make tabs with inventory for all the different types of things, but inevitably, the things in one of those tabs, one or more, will fill up, and then they complain about all the things under my junk tab or all the things under my consumables tab. So you still end up having a problem, and I think encumbrance helps solve that as much as some people don't like it.

But some other ideas would be to make it... You're trying to solve the problem of people have something that they don't feel like they should use. You could make it so, here's instead of it's things you pick up, here's an item that has charges, and the charges somehow get restored. For example, let's say instead of picking up heal potions, you just have a magic flask that, when you dip in a Magic Fountain, fills up with five charges of heal. You know you can always go back to that Fountain and fill it back up. This lets the designer place these Fountains at a regular enough intervals that people feel like they don't have to run too far to get to a fountain, but in the middle of combat, you probably can't run off to the fountain. In some boss combats, maybe gates or something prevent you from even leaving the arena. So there's no hoarding in the sense of, you don't feel like you have to save those heal potions for a particular combat, but once that combat starts, you know you only have no more than say three or five charges. It also is easier for the designer than to design a combat knowing that there's a limit on how many of these things will be available.

I think other ways you can do this, which factor into other game mechanics people want to do, is maybe your magic heal flasks completely refills when you sleep, but sleeping costs time and money. So time passes, and there's a certain amount of money involved in sleeping, either you have to rent a room or bed, or you have to camp and it uses camping supplies. You've all seen this in different games. The idea is sleeping is a time and money sink, which is really important for many games to have both of those. So you will often find yourself going, well, I still have a couple of charges left on this. I keep going rather than have that time and money sink happen.

And then lastly, and you've seen this in other games, found items can go into special places. Maybe if it's junk, it just goes into a junk bag that doesn't count against your encumbrance, and when you go to town, it'll automatically gets sold. So you can think of junk items as money. They're effectively found money. If you played Pillars, you know we had something called a stash, and the stash was something that you could put things into it, but you could only take out the last thing you put in. The idea for a stash and that way you had to play if you wanted to get into it. The idea for stash was throw things in the stash, don't worry about the stash. When you get to town, you can review what's in your stash, sell what's in your stash. This lets people leave nothing behind, and re, but they have to review it later. It's like kind of gone, or it's not really something for them to use as an active inventory.

So these are a lot of ways you can deal with items. So let's talk a little bit about skills. There's always going to be that problem where you give someone a really powerful, like you have a big Fireball or a death spell or a heal everybody spell, and you feel like, well, I don't want to use this unless I'm being attacked by something powerful or a lot of things or everybody in the party's hurt. That makes sense. Otherwise, I'll do individual heals. There's a lot of ways you can get around feeling like people need to hoard those uses of their skills. For example, you may have a skill set up so that there's a lot of free ones that do a small amount of damage that build up to the use of a big one. You see this in a lot of games, a lot of melee attacks that build up to a big finish, or the way we did monks, they do their little attacks, they let themselves get hurt, they build up those wounds, and then they power their big attacks with the wounds. Those are ways of telling player players you have these big abilities, but you're gonna have to wait to use them, but when you can use them, you might as well use them because you're still building up to use them again. So you almost want to use them, so that you can start rebuilding a second use so you can use them two, three, four times in combat.

You can also have spells that use Mana, um,

 and therefore you don't hoard individual spells. Yeah, now people kind of hoard Mana, but you could have a Mana potion with charges like that heal potion, so they don't think of Mana as something that they always have to conserve super carefully because it can be renewed to a limit, and that way designers can still plan for this is how many times you can renew Mana in one particular combat.

Pillars use something that I really liked, which was refreshing skills and spells during combat. There were skills you could use frequently, you'd use them, and then they'd cool down, and you could use them again. There were skills that refreshed after every combat, so you had this skill, and you knew you could only use it once, but you got to use it in this combat, so you probably did use it every combat. Then there are ones that refreshed every day or every sleep period. Again, the sleep period here can cost time and money, so this stuff works if the designer is thinking of what the money sink and time sink is going to cost the player.

Now, there's a lot more you can do. In fact, what I do is I encourage designers and anybody working on the game to brainstorm methods that make sense for your game, that exist in mechanics that encourage the use of these abilities, and that's something that I kind of want to say that's kind of the moral of this entire talk. When you're designing, many people feel like they need to design against a behavior, like people are hoarding, how can I stop them. The real question is, why aren't they using? You want to design to encourage a behavior. If you want players to use abilities, give them a reason they want to use it, and that's counter to that overriding reason, if I better save it for a better time. If it's an ability you could use in every combat, they're great. They're probably using every combat, especially near the end of a combat, they're like, oh, there's one guy left. I'll do the big damage spell against him, the faster I get him down the better. If you have a spell that's usable once a day, and you have an encounter when going back to town, you might as well use that spell because you're about to go into town and reset all your abilities.

So that's what I've always encouraged designers to think about. There's a strong desire to thwart players, but that comes across in your DES, in your game, and in your design. What you really want to do is reward somehow, encourage somehow a player to play the game the way they that you want them to, and then their play that way because it's in their best interest, but you've designed for it to be played that way, so you enjoy them doing that. It's kind of, I know that feels a little backwards, that hey, shouldn't I just make the game out there and let people play how they want. Yeah, you should always let people play how they want, but if there's a certain way you want them to play, rewarding them to play that way is very good. It's what I used to say about evil players, you can be evil, but the game will have reactions against that, and you're gonna have to live with it. It's your choice, and you shouldn't be surprised that you know, you slaughter everybody in one town, and then people in the next town don't like you.

So always design towards encouraging the behaviors from the players you want, and then you can get the results you want. So encourage people to use their items and use their spells and skills, and they'll do so, and they won't feel like they're being railroaded, and they but they also will feel like, hey, I got to use those things, and I'm gonna get to use them again, and it's win-win for everybody. Other than that, I don't have anything to say about hoarding. Some people love hoarding stuff. I've seen the Skyrim homes that are full of cheese. If that's the way you want to play, more power to you. I just think the game should be designed with encouraging certain kinds of behaviors. So I hope that answers your question, Mr. awesome 5211.

Playing My Older Games.md
Youtube Link:
https://youtu.be/rHSlfFuIuls?si=OExwY-f77VprhAFZ

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim, and today I want to talk about playing my older games. There have been several suggestions people have had; they want to have me play some of my older games and stream it or just stream in general. I'm not really interested in that. I mean, it's not my thing. I don't want that to be the channel's focus, and I also think there's a bunch of much better people out there who stream themselves playing games.

The same way, I don't, I mean, I've talked to some people I've worked with before, but I don't really want this to turn into an interview channel. I brought them on because I was talking about things that I thought they could add a lot to the conversation about what I wanted to explore things about Fallout, because even though that's very popular, Fallout's popular, I don't have as many notes on that as I do say on most of the stuff I have at Troika.

So, what I did do though is I went and played four of my early games. I played Fallout, Arcanum, Temple of Elemental Evil, and Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines. First, I want to say, some people are going, "Oh good, those are your first four games." No, my first game was Grand Slam Bridge, then I made Bard's Tale Construction Set, then I made Rags to Riches. But these are my first four RPGs, so they're the first four games that kicked off my long career in making role-playing games.

But the first thing I realized when I was playing these is I owe a lot of thanks to Microsoft that these games were even still playable. Microsoft has done a lot to make sure that backward compatibility exists in Windows, and where it doesn't exist, it's fairly easy to like force a game to play, even if you just download something like DOSBox, and you can play DOS games in it.

Now you may think, "Well, this is easy. Try doing that on a Mac." There's a Fallout Mac, but I doubt if you're going to be able to play it on modern Apple hardware because Apple simply doesn't care about that kind of stuff. In fact, the people I know who play Fallout on modern Apple hardware are playing the Windows Fallout in a Windows emulator on their Mac. So, thanks, Microsoft.

Let me talk about some things that kind of struck me as I played through these games. I didn't finish all of them. What I did is I went in, made a character, played some side quests, played along some of the main story quest, just it brought back a lot of memories about making the game. But what I really want to talk to you about is my reaction to them as games being played in modern times.

Probably the first thing that hit me is, wow, these resolutions are low. I mean, they're not even as low as my first games were, 320x200, which on the monitor I'm playing on, which is a 1920x1080 monitor, 320x200 is six times less wide and five and a half times less tall, 5.4 for people who are following along with their calculators. Even my 640x480 games, you know, they stretch and expand on my on a modern monitor, but there is something else that's at play here, and this is something that's there's a very big difference between how a CRT monitor, cathode ray tube monitor, and an LCD monitor display things.

When CRTs display pixels, as you know, it's where the ray hit the phosphor tube and excited it to glow in a particular color in a particular shade of color. That's very similar to splat techniques if you're like gaen splatting and how to create a 3D scene, you know, that's a whole other talk, but just trust me, there's something called splatting which is very similar to how even a CRT even displays compared to an LCD, which has a grid of pixels divided into sub-pixels, which are, you know, green, red, and blue. And these light up as determined by what pixels you're trying to draw, but those are in isolated little cells, so there's a minute little grid, and those pixels never cross it where CRTs are like Splat, Splat, Splat, Splat of pixels, so there's this automatic aliasing that's happening, or anti-aliasing. You're seeing basically a smear of pixels and not a grid of pixels, and that really does make the older games look different. Fallout on a CRT looks different than Fallout on an LCD. So there was that kind of thing. In addition to my memory, I always remember things in a higher resolution than I'm seeing them. There was that. That was a big thing. I was like, all of these games made me go, uh, we really didn't have much resolution. I mean, even Vampire, you could sometimes see things, you know, well, that we could have used a few more poses there or high-resolution texture or some normal maps or some better lighting.

But anyway, the other thing that tended to hit me when I'm playing my old games are, why did I do that? I often was playing because, as I got older and my design philosophy matured, I found myself often thinking, well, you design something because you're the designer trying to get the player to play a certain way, and your design should lead you along that path. Sometimes I'm playing my old games, and I'm like, why did I want them to do this? Why did I want them to walk along this path? A perfect example of that was in Temple in character creation where it hits you with party alignment, which is nothing from D&D. It's like, hey, you have to pick a party alignment to make sure all your characters are within one step of the global party alignment for your character. And I do have my notes on that, and I did it because, well, I did it to solve a problem in Temple where you could have anyone be the speaker by reordering your party. You could have anyone be the speaker for the group, and if you let all the different alignments in, it was very easy to have the good guys speak to the Paladin and the bad guys speak to the evil temple people, and it felt wrong to let one group have, like, cover all the bases that way.

Plus, I remember doing party alignment in my high school D&D group, and sure enough, my notes are there saying, "Yep, this is a good solution." The reason I did it in my D&D group is when we first started playing, we had weird groups with like paladins and assassins, and it felt weird. It's like the paladin would never have tolerated the assassin in the group. It just made sense to add something like party alignment to govern the creation of parties. I'm actually surprised that number comes up in D&D. I think they just leave it to the DM and the players to work out why this particular group is together.

The third thing I noticed when playing my games is probably the most common thing that kept hitting me and kept me go, uh, and that was UI. I did a UI video where I talked about in the early days, we didn't even really think about UI.

 UI was something we just threw on like, oh, we've designed inventory, or we've designed an option screen, and we quickly threw together a UI to let you access it. We didn't think about accessibility at all, but we also didn't think about, does it make sense? Is it something when people first are experiencing it, do they know immediately what they're supposed to do? Because we interacted with that every day, multiple times a day, for years. Of course, we understood what it is. The biggest problem with my older games is a lot of the UI feels very clunky to me, and Fallout was very much that way. Arcanum feels that way to me too. I think Temple's better. I really still like the radio menu, but if you're constantly throwing the same spell, it does feel weird to be like, okay, bring up, you know, abilities, spells, magic user, first level, magic missile, every single time. I wish we had done hotkey bars in that game.

So aside from UI, the other thing that surprised me the most, and this is my fourth and final one, there was a lot of content in my older games that I literally didn't remember was there. Now, yeah, one part of that is I've forgotten about it. I mean, Fallout was made 26 years ago now, and Arcanum is came out 22 years ago. These are old games, and I just don't remember this content, but a big chunk of it, and people have to remember, I didn't make it. The only dialogues I wrote were in Temple, and the only quests I did the whole implementation of were in Temple. There were a lot of ideas that I made, a lot of quest ideas that went of mine that went into Arcanum, but someone else implemented them. And in Fallout, I approved almost everything that went in, but I didn't do a lot of it, so a lot of it was stuff that was like, somebody came by and said, "Hey, I'm going to put in a quest to do this." I'm like, "Sounds good." I may never have played it. There was, I was wearing too many hats and too busy to have played all of Fallout's content before it shipped. I played a lot of Arcanum, but Arcanum had so much content. I would like to say I played all of Outer World's content, and I think I played almost all of it, but even then, I think I played it 16 times, maybe more. But there are, there's so much dialogue, and there's so much dialogue that's locked behind skills or perks or previous actions in the game that I'm sure that there are dialogue nodes that I've never seen either because they weren't available to the character I was making, I was playing, or the choices I made on that player. I never picked that option.

So yeah, there's some content in my older games, and I'm like, I literally do not remember this. Part of it, though, is because I didn't make it, and I didn't experience it. It was fun to see it for the first time, and it made me laugh, which was a really good rule of thumb in a lot of my games. People put things in deliberately to try to make me laugh. I still remember whenever I say that, I hear most recently, our writer, Natai, on Outer Worlds, who said whenever he was stuck writing dumb dialogue, he just think to himself, "What would Tim say?" But it always made me laugh.

So playing through these older games, Fallout, Arcanum, Temple of Elemental Evil, and Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines, there were places in it that I was literally laughing out loud. I love the content. In many cases, I could kind of remember who did it, and I was like, oh, I almost hear it in their voice, or them coming in to tell me, "Hey, I just put this in." And sometimes, like I said, it was brand new to me, and I just loved it and enjoyed it.

So that's me playing my older games. The biggest things I got out of it were, you know, wow, they're low resolution; wow, I don't know why I did that; oh yeah, there it is in my notes; wow, the UI is clunky; and wow, there's a lot of content in here I don't remember ever having been put in. So it's fun to go back and play them, and you know, with places like GOG (Good Old Games) and Steam having these older games, games with wrappers, and making them playable, you might want to play them too. I don't make any money off of it, but knock yourself out if you want to play these older games. I think they're still fun. I think they hold up today. They're just a little clunky.

Playtesting The Outer Worlds.md

Hi, it's me, Tim. Today, I want to talk about playtesting in the inner worlds. The reason I want to focus on that is, in some previous videos, I talked about examples of bad playtesting that happened on my game, specifically Temple of Elemental Evil, where the external QA group decided they didn't like playing bards, so they never played them, and we shipped with a really bad crash bug. Even though I played with an all-bard group, I never saw the bug, but they never played bards, so I was mad. And then on Vampire: Bloodlines, almost the exact same thing. QA ignored our test plan, decided they didn't like Nosferatu because they were ugly, and just didn't play that Clan, and again, we shipped with a bad crash bug if you played Nosferatu, that was unavoidable if you played Nosferatu, meaning if they had played Nosferatu just one time, they would have found that bug. Fortunately, that didn't happen on The Outer Worlds. We had an internal QA group who's awesome. We'd also like to point out we shipped with very few bugs. It was not, in fact, it was called out as being, wow, this is a very bug-free Obsidian game, and I want to give props to that QA group, and especially the lead, Taylor Swope.

We not only generated a test plan together, but Taylor would come and talk to me once a week, just, you know, one-on-one. I would ask him how things were going. I would point out new features that had gone in the game that probably needed testing in the coming week, as if, you know, he was already on top of that, but I just like saying, hey, this is something I'm really excited about, test those science weapons. And he would tell me things about how, what they were thinking, like, stuff that didn't feel right or that they were seeing a lot of bugs on a particular thing or something wasn't being fixed, and because it wasn't fixed, it was blocking testing other things. And that was super useful. Sometimes I just go down the hall and ask them how things were going that day. You know, I'd go by QA, and I'd see them playing, and I'd go on and watch. Sometimes funny things were happening. Once I went in and said, hey, the game's not working for me, is the build bad? And they were all playing. That's the day I found out something was very, very bad with my machine's memory.

But part of the reason QA was so good in The Outer Worlds is it was internal, so it was very easy to have communication back and forth. But I want to call out specifically Taylor Swope, the lead of QA. When he saw how many different ways that you could play Outer Worlds, and that's difficult. It's hard. It's very hard to playtest one of my games because usually there's so many builds you can make. The world is open. You can go where you want most of the time. You can make decisions on how to play and then change up how you're playing, and people will try doing extreme things like I'm going to kill everybody without talking to them, or I'm not going to ever kill anyone, but I still want to be able to finish this game in that play style. That there's just a lot to do.

One way to assure that is Taylor made a little program you could run. It was really cool, I guess you'd call it an app, but it was a program, and it would, you'd run it, and it would tell you what kind of build to make, like what attributes you should take, what skills you should tag, and then spend points in, even whether you should play with a controller or not, or on a particular platform. And what was great is that forced the people under him in QA to play differently all the time and possibly play some way they didn't think they would play, which was very useful for finding bugs because if your bugs were mostly in melee combat or there was a bug in a particular perk that was mainly for melee players, and people who didn't play melee that much and because of that were much less likely even pick that perk, you're not gonna see those bugs reported very often.

They're also really good at taking existing bugs, and if you saw it happen again, they'd still report it, but they'd file that bug under another bug because one problem I had with external QAs, they would just shove bugs at you, and then you'd fix one of them and discover that there are 90 other reports of the exact same bug, but now you have to go through this giant database and mark them all as fixed, where in this one, it was, here's this bug, and we've seen it 90 more times, and once you market it as fixed, boom, and they know to go back and test it, and then they can mark all those bugs fixed.

So, the cool thing is, two, that I had a lot of time towards the end to play the game because the systems design was done, the um, I wasn't doing programming, so I wasn't really on active bug fixing, fixing unless it was something that came in that was like, I don't think this rule works. So I started playing the game a lot, and I told you I keep notes on everything, and I found my notes on playing The Outer Worlds. I played through start to finish 16 times. Now, I did buy more than that, but I, I'm just counting the ones where I couldn't finish because often earlier in this, in the process, you literally couldn't finish, either the maps weren't ready yet, or there were just crash bugs that happened, um, either because bugs would accumulate as you played or there was something, you know, specific to a later map that caused a problem. But within the last, I'm sure the last nine months before we shipped, the game was incredibly stable, start to finish, and I started doing playthroughs, and I have my playthroughs, so I thought I'd tell you what the 16 different ways I played Outer Worlds, especially for anyone out there, if you've only played it once, you may just want to play it another way just to see all the different things we planned for and thought you would do. Don't think that the only thing that we planned for was, well, do you work for Phineas or do you work for the board? There's other things you can try, but here are my places. I'm going to read through them. I got him on the other screen.

Playthrough one, named Sneaky McHill. He was a sniper. I tagged ranged and stealth. That's my classic playthrough on so many RPGs. I don't know why I'm always drawn to that, but I am. Playthrough 2 was What's Up Dude, generalist. What this means is I don't remember what scales I tagged, but every time I got skill points, I spread them evenly through all the skills. This meant that I didn't really get a lot of them above 50, at least not for a long time, so I could start, um, getting those specialty unlocks, but it was also cool

 because whenever I entered an area, there I had a lot of options on how to do quests.

Number three was Snuggler, not Smuggler, snuggler was a pure dialogue character. I tag dialogue and ranged. I did range just because if there was somebody you couldn't talk to, you know, especially a monster, he just tried shooting it. That one was fun. I liked my, uh, I like Sneaking the Kill better.

Number four was Butch McSwipey. Melee character, low intelligence. This is, that was the first time I wanted to go through and test all those dumb dialogues, many of which people said they wrote for me, and I just wanted to see how fun they were. It was also my first time playing controller only. And one of the things that came up was I found a map that I tried fighting the NPCs there three times. It was the Devil's Peak on Monarch, very vertical, lots of platforms, everybody on those platforms had ranged weapons and were just shooting down at me, and I was melee only, and I could usually take out people on the ground and maybe the first platform, but I was dead past that, threw it back to QA and tagged my lead designer and said, this is too hard, let's take a look at it, and they changed some things up.

My fifth character was Doctor Leader. He was my low dexterity character, so that affected all the skills associated with dexterity as well. I tagged tech and leader, so that you know he could do, he was good at science and things like that, and he was good at with having, he had good companions, which were really important later in the game because his combat was terrible, so he needed companion support.

My sixth one was Rango McLeader, my first Supernova playthrough. So this is a character that had to eat and drink and sleep, and fast travel was restricted to just going back to the ship, so a lot of times, you would go back to the ship, and then you had to fight your way back out. On Rango, I tagged ranged skills and leader skills, so he's good at shooting something, but if it got pretty close to him, I was glad I had those companions.

My seventh playthrough was named Eric the Milk, after my producer. I decided to play the game the way Eric always played, which is I killed everything. I would often kill Thanksgiving NPCs before I talked to them because, remember, in Outer Worlds, we didn't really tag NPCs as essential, which is what other RPGs call them, so you could kill anything, you kill anybody, anywhere. That uncovered some interesting bugs that got fixed. For Eric DeMille, of course, I tagged melee and ranged because that's all he did, he hit things, and he shot things. That worked. Thank you, Mr. DeMille.

My character eight was Sneaker Speaker, which obviously I picked stealth a dialogue. This is the one and only time I tested story mode, which was the easy mode, so I had fun playing it. Combat's really easy on that mode. I'm glad we include it because some people just want to play through the story and meet the NPCs and have fun, and I agree there should be a mode for that, and it shouldn't be called like baby mode or, you know, oh pew pew mode, it should just be story mode. That's what you want, story, and that's fine.

The next time, though, just to turn it on ahead, I made Stealth Boss, and I played in hard mode, and I tagged stealth and leader, and the idea there was I tried to avoid combat when I could. When I couldn't, I had my friends take care of it, and that worked really well.

My tenth one was Dr. Guns. This was my second time playing controller only. I also gave Dr. Guns a very, very low strength, so melee was not a good option for him, and I tagged for Dr. Guns, I tagged Tech and ranged. So with Dr. Guns was, I think my first playthrough where I really started to incorporate the stealth weapons, I'm sorry, the science weapons, into what I did because they scaled science and not your rain skill, and that was super fun. You haven't played through a playthrough where you really played around with the science weapons, they're a little goofy, but I liked, I like goofy, it's fun, it's super fun.

My next character, my 11th character, was Doc Block, again, controller only. This time I loaded two attributes. I had low charm and low temperament. This was not a character you wanted talking to anybody. I def so what I did is I tagged defense and Tech, and basically just tried to have him solve issues with his science skills but not through dialogue. He was an interesting character. He was a little harder than normal. Would have been nice to have played him on story mode.

My 12th character was Teddy. Teddy was controller only, hard mode, low perception. I tagged melee and dialogue. The reason I named him Teddy is after Teddy Roosevelt, which was talk softly but carry a big stick. Teddy, I played, he tried to solve everything through dialogue, and if it didn't work, then he beat you up. That was a good character. I had more fun with him because by the time I played Teddy, a lot of the melee bugs that I found with Butch McSwipey had been fixed, so that was fun.

For the 13th playthrough, I played Heavy Leader. Heavy Leader tagged ranged, but I only spent points in and used heavy weapons. I sold every non-heavy weapon that dropped an astrotech leader, so I had my companions helping me out too. The companions were really useful for handling anything at distance.

The 14th character I made was my Stealthy Leader. Now this is the first time I used Taylor Swope's program, and it selected everything I did here. So I tagged stealth and leader. Taylor's random playthrough generator told me to for the path, pursue the scientists and board path, but ultimately side with the board. The stealth of leadership tags below average dexterity, play on medium difficulty, complete as many companion quests as you can, choose Emerald Veil as the outcome you want, send power to the deserters, when you get the Monarch, you get the nav key to Stellar Bay, and when you get there, put MSI in charge of Monarch, and then the final thing it said to do was take every drug you find as soon as you get it. Like I said, Taylor's program tried to, this was a mixed-up build. I did finish the game with this guy. I remember it was very, very hard because I was always going through withdrawal on something. Um, things would drop, and I, drugs would drop, and I would take them, and they weren't really useful for what I was doing, so like, I have to talk to someone, but I just took a drug that dropped those skills, or I'd have to fight, and my character was not in any position really to fight, but it was fun. It was, um, in some ways, it made the game, even though I was playing on, um, I think I said medium difficulty, it was more like a supern

ova playthrough. Anyway, that was fun.

My 15th character was somebody I recovered from Fallout. I played the original Fallout game with this character, General Generalist. Generalist was a generalist again. I spread my skill points out randomly. I did, however, tag ranged and stealth, so those things got a boost. Um, that was a fun character to play. Um, I was, it was fun and weird to play a game with the, with the same character 20 years later.

And then finally, my 16th character was Dr. Stealth, played on hard difficulty, and I tagged Tech and stealth, and again, this was a character that tried to avoid combat, and when he did, use science weapons. Very fun character. Probably one of my second favorite characters next to, although my, uh, first one, Sneaky McHale, is probably, ranged and stealth is probably my favorite one to do.

So, what did, what are my insights from, from this kind of thing is, one, you really do have to play the game you're making. Two, it helps beyond words to have a good, thoughtful QA group, which I did on this, and third, if you want, if you're bugs first, you have to accept you're going to find bugs as you play, and you have to accept them, and you have to not try to avoid them. You have to, I want this thing to break. I want it to break on me so it doesn't break on you. And I think that really happened on Outer Worlds. We shipped a really good, stable game with a lot of ways to play, and I hope this description of 16 ways I played it encourages some of you to maybe try it again, maybe vary up the difficulty, try it with different items, try it with different involvement with NPCs, you know, and see if you like the game that way, and you know, you might discover something in that path that you really enjoy. Anyway, have a good day.

Procedural vs Handmade Content.md
Youtube Link:
https://youtu.be/jkXd503iCRI?si=_OIxdiFrxiXgvHZo

Hey everyone, it's me, Tim. Today I want to talk about procedural versus handmade content in games. Of course, I've got some preface to all that. First of all, I'm going to call it handmade. I do not like the word bespoke. Bespoke implies handmade and unique, where when I think about handmade content, true, some of handmade content is only used once in a game like a particular dialogue with an NPC, but some handmade content is used on a variety of NPCs such as barks, you know, the things that people say in response to an event happening. Those were handmade by a human but they're used by a variety of NPCs in the game. A human made all of the homes in a particular game, the houses, but there's multiple uses of them throughout the game. So, I like handmade because that doesn't have the extra baggage that bespoke has.

Second, I say procedural. I did do a video where I talked about AI and the rise of AI and the use of AI, but that doesn't cover everything I'm talking about. I've been thinking of procedural content generation forever. I have a whole video about doing it on Arcanum, and I basically used it there for dialogues where I put in op codes that narrative designers could insert into conversations that would expand into not just a line but an entire subtree to handle things that happened a lot like bribing people, opening up barter windows, um, asking for rumors, just general greetings. I mean, the greetings alone had like over a dozen states that a greeting would take into account.

But I had a lot more plans in Arcanum than just that. The random encounters in Arcanum, I wanted to be so much richer. I wanted to not just be here's a collection of monsters and we're dropping you into a sector to fight them. I wanted good encounters too, like oh, here's a merchant or here's some ruins to explore, and once you found them, they were pegged into the world. So, because that sector would be the delta to it, and I've explained how I did tiles and sectors in another video, that sector would be pinned down now as having a delta in it, and that delta was permanent in your gameplay. Play the game again, those ruins may not be there. I loved stuff like that.

In fact, the biggest procedural content that was planned and never done, even in the slightest, were roads. I wanted procedurally generated roads to connect settlements in Arcanum for two reasons. One, it took a long time to do those by hand, and artists would have to go through hundreds, if not thousands, of tiles, certainly thousands, probably tens of thousands to get from one city to another. The other problem was every time they did that, it touched every one of those sectors and saved them out as a delta, just putting in a road between Torrant and any other town on that continent increased the delta size of the Arcanum world map by megs, megs we did not have to spare. So, that never happened.

But even more so, and I think this is funny with Starfield coming out, I talked about how I made different engines before Fallout, where we settled on the sprite engine. I made a voxel engine, and that was exploring islands, and it was really cool, but I made a 3D engine, and I talked about how it was slow, and we didn't go anywhere with it, but what I was making it for was a 3D space exploration game. It was called Universe. It generated a 3D star map that you could spin around, you could rotate, you could see where you were in relation to other stars, you could fly to the other stars. It was going to generate solar systems at random, which is why I did that whole Gurks star system generator that you can see in another video. All of that stuff was coming together for Universe, but whether it was my tech skills or 3D cards at the time, it just really couldn't make it fast and interesting enough. Got set aside, literally never got picked up. So, when I'm approaching this whole procedural versus handmade discussion, this isn't something that I've had in the last few months with the rise of LLMs and ChatGPT and, you know, all the other art-generating AIs. This is stuff I've been thinking of for 25 or 30 years.

Now, I've heard the whole debate about handmade versus procedural. Yes, handmade stuff is unique and original and heartfelt in a way that I've never seen procedural do yet. But it's limited. It is literally finite. You can have a huge team generate nothing but handmade stuff for a decade, and then your game comes out, and boom, finite. You can do more DLCs, again finite, finite. What I love about procedural is it is literally infinite. You can have an infinite amount of encounters.

Now, yes, I've seen the complaints about procedural. People say procedural stuff is filler, it's random, it's odd, you can figure out the algorithm. That's true. Um, that's why I think you need richer algorithms. You need algorithms that also explore space so they can come up with things that the person who made the algorithm never would have thought of. These things already exist. Um, for decades, they've been doing research into discovery using AI to explore through data sets or just have new ways of looking at putting data together. I think this could be done to games.

And I think I'm not saying one is better than the other and one should be used exclusively. I'm saying they both have their place. Let me talk to you about what I would do with something like this. Imagine the original Fallout game, but increase the random encounters to include randomly generated caves, military bases, town ruins, still functional towns with people in them doing things. Now imagine when you find these things, you find them, they get pegged on the map. Now they exist. You can fast travel back there. You start a new game, it's a whole new set of things that are out there. It makes it takes replayability to a new level that I always wished my games had. But now, imagine that you can go into places that actually have procedurally generated NPCs, like one of those towns, and they can ask you to find something or find someone. I mean, they basically give you quests.

And those things they're asking you to do may lead to other procedurally generated places. Yes, it may find an old cave you explored and place the item in there and repopulate it, or it may generate a whole new cave in a new location that you've never been to. To me, that's exciting. You may find one of these towns, and you may arrive when a raid is happening. We always heard about raiders, but we never actually saw them raiding. You can actually arrive when this raid is happening, and you can decide, are going to help the raiders, are going to help the town, you're going to kill everybody and take their stuff. No one will ever know you were there, right? It's just, it's a richer world for you to explore your own morality, which is what I loved about Fallout.

I also like the idea that once you discover two towns and they get generated, and people get generated

, and they've given you quests, and you've learned to, you've learned what these people are like, they have personalities, have all this stuff, they have relationships with each other, maybe these two towns or two factions that have been generated, they go to war, and they fight. What side are you gonna fight on? Are you going to choose a side, are you just going to watch what happened? It reminds me of the end of Fallout New Vegas, but this is stuff that's happening throughout the Fallout map. If two towns get created and grow and start generating things, maybe you can have a rule saying if the two towns get too close to each other when they expand, or maybe you can have a rule saying if they ever go to generate a quest and it goes into a sector that's already been predefined for something for the other town, that's marked as a conflict, a point of friction. Once two towns have too many points of friction, maybe they just go to war with each other. So it even makes sense. You wouldn't have two towns on the opposite end of the map go, "We hate each other, you need to travel all the way over here to some place we've never been and fight this town." No, it would always be somebody fairly nearby, and they could even tell you, "We're mad at them because we were going to make farms and they got there first," or "We've been, I've been hearing from maybe a mayor's telling you about this because I've been hearing from townsfolk who, you know, their kid got kidnapped and we found them in a village owned by this other group." Cool. So you can use procedural generation to generate that kind of friction and from that generated story that makes sense. These just aren't two random people are mad at each other; they have reasons to be mad, and maybe you were involved in some of them. Maybe you're already rescued someone's kid from this other group, and now you're finding out there's even more points of friction. You kind of understand why they want that war. I like that.

Let's look at something like Skyrim, Oblivion. They did this to some extent with their radiant system, but I just see ways of taking the radiant stuff to a whole new level. Um, imagine instead of like the Thieves Guild used to give you quests to go find items, and it would generate an item and go throw them in an existing building somewhere. Sometimes there are places you'd already been, so they got re-popped, sometimes it was someplace you'd never been, so great, you got to discover a new cave somewhere. Imagine that those quests lead to brand new procedurally generated dungeons that you've never found before, there are often some mountainside, and you've never been there. That's cool because now, in addition to the radiant quest, you have a reason to be in that dungeon, but you have this huge dungeon to explore.

Maybe dungeons and towns that you've already cleared out and they're marked as clear, now they're taken over by new groups. Maybe you cleared out a draugr dungeon, and now bandits are in there. Maybe, I don't know why you would do it, but maybe you wiped out a town, and a nearby town has moved people in, and they're farming there, and they're taking over buildings there. I can see that happening and be super fun because it makes you realize that the world is not an empty place.

I love the idea of a powerful new NPC arising in the world and being something that you now are asked to deal with. Maybe it's a fighter who has a lot of followers, so there's a lot of variety there. He's got archers and, you know, hardcore tank guys, and maybe he has a wizard buddy, and they're layered somewhere, and you have to, you know, fight their people, and then you finally find out where they are, and you have to get in there and take care of them. Maybe you can talk about it, maybe you can convince them to move, maybe you do have to fight them. I love stuff like that. Maybe there's a ton of gods in Skyrim, a lot of them are crazy or evil, maybe a high priest of them rises up, a ton of followers, temples going out, killing people or converting them. Maybe temples are showing up in some of the towns you've already been to, there's a now a temple on the outskirts. That's really cool. The million of draugr, the millions of draugr ruins out there, maybe you find one that they've awakened a powerful lich from a long time ago, there's a whole bunch of classes of draugur power levels you've never seen before. That would be cool, and this is stuff that could just be generated.

If you think this map is getting crowded, by the way, don't worry about it. Existing caves can be extended deeper, in addition to making new ones on the world map. You could make islands offshore that you can only get to with fast travel, so you don't actually have to place them, you just move to the edge of the map, it goes, "Which one of these islands do you want to go to?" There could be floating cloud castles that come all over the map and then pass beyond it, so you have a window where you can go and do something with it, and then it's gone. Maybe they're just portals to new realms, maybe there are portals to places besides the demon realms like there were in Oblivion. So, there's a lot of ways you can extend them, extend places to go, without worrying about running out of space on the map.

Because of the work I did on my Universe game, this makes me think of Starfield or Star Citizen, which I will admit, I haven't followed much. These could take these ideas to much bigger heights than you could do on a land-based game like Skyrim or Fallout. Just surveying the galaxy would be a fun thing, especially if there was someone paying you. They pay you a certain amount of money every time you find an M-class world, but those are rare, so you start doing surveys, you start noticing that certain stellar types tend to have them, so you start doing stellar cartography, narrowing down where you want to actually jump to and do planetary surveys.

Maybe that gets you into starship battles, maybe there are factions having battles, and you're like, "I like fights, I like these fights better." Maybe you're looking for alien life, maybe to join with whatever, you know, federation you're with, maybe you're looking to battle them, maybe you're looking for ones that have gone extinct, so you can steal their tech. Maybe there's a whole crafting system, and whenever you find an alien race, they have some new bizarre tech line that you've opened up for crafting. I just, this stuff is endless, it's the stuff I'm talking about, or, you know, take any systemic mechanic in an RPG that you like, and you can probably extend it procedurally.

I actually have a name for these, I'm calling these forever games. Forever games are things that while they do include a lot of handmade content and handmade DLC will come out for them, they include a lot of procedurally generated stuff too, along all the lines of stuff I just said.

 So if you love a game like Fallout or Skyrim, you can just play it forever. There will always be new things to do, there will always be new discoveries, there'll always be some way of taking some system mechanic you like, crafting, magic, tech, whatever, and push it farther, and I think that's a really, really cool idea. I even talked about my ideas of procedurally generating the mechanics themselves, like generating new perks. I have ideas on that, but that just, it's technical, and it goes beyond the scope of this particular video. I'm just saying, there's so much that could be done with these forever games that I feel like we're on the cusp of something big and amazing, and it could really happen soon. Hoping it does.

Anyway, got a little excited there at the end. Those are my thoughts on procedural versus handmade content.

Programmer Roles Explained.md
Youtube Link:

https://youtu.be/nQ2IMGC569U?si=f7Kn8Nt_DKmpCjrS

**Intro**

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim. Today I want to answer another question, this one from ATA 94, who asks, "Can you tell me what is the difference between a lead position and a so-called not lead position?" Sure, I can do that. Now, this is something that has changed a bit over time, but I'd say it's been pretty stable like this for about the last 20 years, and it's very similar for artists and designers and people in the sound department and production. So I'm going to describe it for the one I'm most familiar with, which is programmer, and I'll try to get very detailed with what it is, and then you'll see how that maps over to the other departments. I'm going to start at the top with the lead, and I'll go down to all the various subcategories. So let's start with the Lead Programmer.

**Lead Programmer**

The lead programmer is the person who's in charge of all the programmers who are working on one particular game. He answers to the game director, who I've talked about in other videos. The game director is the one who kind of keeps the vision of the game in his or her head. He or she is the one who wrote most of the initial documents about here's what the setting's like, here's what the story is like, here's what mechanics I want, and then the leads step in and start doing what I call the realization of that. The lead designer may step in and write design documents that can be implemented by a programmer, and the artist steps in and starts doing concept, having concept art done, and deciding what the art style of the game is going to be. The lead programmer at this point would step in and look at all of the modules this game is going to need. This is how instances are going to be set up. This is all things that the lead has to do right at the beginning of the game to try to establish how everything's going to be coded. 

While the game is actually in development, in addition to still doing these things, because these things change, the lead programmer meets with the other leads and the director. This is where they coordinate what's going on. This usually happens about once a week. This is where they have to be very good at talking to people who are not programmers, so you have to be the type of programmer who can stop talking in programes because you're talking to a lead artist and a lead designer and a lead musician and the production lead, and they're not going to understand all the nitty-gritty.

Now, I've often said I love it when people in other departments learn how to code or learn some stuff about how art's done because it makes those meetings flow better, but the lead programmer ultimately is responsible for those other leads and the director understanding what is going on in programming. They, the lead programmer, frequently structures code, meaning he's already broken up the game into very high level modules and decides what's going to be done in those. He's the one who schedules the programmers, meaning he assigns them to these different things. He may not, he may give them estimates, or he may just confirm the estimates that come up through the senior programmers, and I'll talk about that. He, of course, is responsible for managing this entire group, so he writes the reviews for the people in his programming department. Some of those reviews may get written by the seniors, and then he signs off on them, and if he agrees with them, he also handles any issues both within his department and between his department and other departments. So if there are two programmers, let's say have two senior programmers arguing over how something should be coded, he may step in. Let's say the art director, the or the lead artist, comes and says, "I'm having problems with one of your programmers." That's he has to take care of.

**Principal Programmer**

That, for many people, for many programmers, being the lead programmer is the end goal. It's what they want to do. For some of them, being the lead programmer is their step towards being the game director. By the way, often, and I'm finding this more and more often, lead programmers being changed to programming director because then they're saying the underneath, the leads are becoming specialized, so you may have a lead network programmer and a lead graphics programmer, and because of that, you may call the lead overall programmer maybe called a programming director. It's no different than what I just described. It's just kind of a naming convention to distinguish them from specialist leads.

And let me talk about specialists for a second. Like I mentioned in the previous video, this has arisen more and more in the industry that programmers are specializing in things like gameplay or networking or graphics or UI, or, you know, there's any number of specialties that can happen. If you're really good at that but you don't want to manage, several companies have created something called principal programmer, so you're a principal graphics programmer, you're a principal networking programmer. This is almost always a specialist, but they don't manage people. They don't have any programmers under them, and they're entirely responsible for some section of the game code within their specialty. Usually, they have little to no oversight from the lead programmer because within that specialty, they're the last word. They're the one who's working out, "This is exactly how our networking code is going to work." They report to the lead. They let the lead know what, how things are going, what's available, what the general API will be, in other words, the interface to the other programmers, so that the lead can direct other people who be who will be using that code. But the principal usually has, you know, all the responsibility and authority within that code section. So I often see them as adjacent to the lead but not quite under, but in a non-managerial way.

So let's talk about senior programmers.

**Senior Programmer**

Senior programmers manage the staff level and juniors more hands-on than the lead will. Senior programmers, often this is where specialization begins. This is where somebody will decide, "I've been doing programming for a while. I think I want to do gameplay. I think I want to do graphics." It doesn't make sense to have like a junior network programmer because when somebody is specialized, you kind of assume they know what they're doing, and a junior may not know that. So senior is where you start seeing these specializations be attached to their title. So you may have a senior network programmer or senior graphics programmer. Senior programmers are responsible for structuring their own code and anyone who reports to them. They're the one who decides, for example, what algorithms they're going to use, what the programming interface, the API, will look like. They give their own time estimates for their code. They review the time estimates of the people who are working under them to see if they make sense. 

Seniors often are the ones that lead, and I know that's a little confusing, strike teams. Strike teams are things that arise during development where there's a particular part of the game that needs close attention for a while, especially if you're trying to decide the best way to handle certain things. We often had strike teams for things like combat, UI, if there's a multiplayer section of the game, it usually got

 a strike team, and these are where these are groups of multidisciplinary people, maybe a programmer or two, an artist or two, a designer or two, somebody from audio, and this group does rapid iteration in that area to decide, "Okay, this is the best way to proceed. We're going to do this." Sometimes after they're done, the strike team ends, and they go and implement all that, but frequently they, they implement and keep meeting to make sure the implementation is going the way they expected it to. 

What's great about this is usually some member of production, one of the, the producer or an assistant producer, will go to these strike teams to keep track of all the new tasks that they're creating, especially tasks for things like, "Oh, we need extra art that we didn't plan for," or "O, there's a whole family of sound effects that are going to be needed because we just added all these particle effects," which is a bunch of new art we need for this section of combat. So seniors usually run those strike teams. The senior programmers, the goal of a senior programmer is to learn how to work well with non-programmers. This is where the lead programmer gets it from, from these strike teams. You're learning how to interact and talk and manage and direct people who are not programmers. This is where you often, at the senior level, figure out whether you're going to go up to be lead or go to be a principal because if you're not good at managing, principal is going to be it for you. 

By the way, a lot of people think they're good at managing, and then they're not good at managing. It's sort of like people think they're good at DMing, and then they're not good at DMing. It's just a thing, and I, I don't know whether it's teachable. Most people I know are just good at it naturally, but I'm sure there are classes that can help people manage better.

The next level is interesting. I called it staff, like staff programmer. Frequently I see companies that don't put any prefix on this, and then it means if you're a programmer, you're at the level between senior and junior.

**Staff Programmer**

A staff programmer is someone who has professional experience on something. So I often see people come in from school, or they've, they've made a couple of demos on their own, and they want to be a senior, or a or lead. I'm like, no, you'll probably be a junior at best. You will be a staff because I want to see how you handle this role of doing professional game code. This is the goal of this. You're on your way to be a senior. Staff programmers are the are where you have learned to manage juniors, although you have a senior who's watching you do that and going along with you. You learn to structure your own code, meaning you're deciding the API, and you're writing, you're deciding the algorithm to use, but with oversight from your senior. The goal is when to become a senior and learn how to structure code on your own, estimate your time on your own, and manage other programmers on your own.

Finally, there's the junior programmer.

**Junior Programmer**

Junior programmers are people who already know how to code. The industry is not there to teach you how to code. They are people who come in who have little to no professional experience. They're usually given very specific functions or methods to write. They're told how long, what the expectation is, how long it will take to write them, so they don't make their own estimates. They're usually told, "Here's something I want you to do. It will take you a week. I want you to use this algorithm, them, or maybe this one, whatever one you are comfortable with and think will work better." The code is reviewed regularly, sometimes by a staff, sometimes by a senior, very rarely by the lead themselves. The goal of a junior is to learn how to write your own code, debug your own code, optimize your own code through all the stages of the life cycle of a game. When you master that, then you can go on to be a staff programmer.

Now, as you go up these tiers, of course, salary goes up, but I hope from what I described, you also know responsibilities go up too. If something, if a piece of code is written with a bad API or bad algorithm, you usually don't go blame the juniors. You're, you usually go talk to the staff or the senior that decided on that. Some companies, especially really big ones like Microsoft, have multiple tiers inside each one of these levels that I described to you. So there may be a junior programmer level three or a senior programmer level one, and the reason these exist is it's frequently the case now where you spend a few years at each tier, but you still want to be to get a salary increase, and you want to be promoted, and people want to be able to distinguish a junior programmer that's been there three years from a junior programmer that was hired last month. So they often instigate these levels, so you know the higher level has more experience than the lower level.

Now, within all of this, I, I've described that people are learning how to manage. My experience is good managers are becoming rarer, harder to find, or unwilling to step into management roles. I see more and more seniors wanting to be principles than leads. I'm not sure why this is. I'm not sure if the industry has changed. I'm not sure if people have changed. However, I have noticed frequently that those who are willing and want to step up to be a manager are often those who are the most unsuitable. They have no experience doing it. They have no personal skills. The people who worked under them did not like working under them in any way. They're often too cautious or obstructionist, or they really see going management as a way of getting their own ideas expressed in the game. So in other words, they don't want to be a manager because they're good at managing or they want to manage. They view it as a way of then overriding everybody under them, so their own ideas go in. These make bad managers. So the hope and goal of having this hierarchy is by the time someone becomes a senior and starts managing people, you should already have a good idea of how good they are at it, and it's also another reason why when I've had people who are straight out of university and they're like, "I want to be a senior," I'm like, no, no, I need to see you in action before you can jump up to something like that.

There are other things that have changed over time. I see people's code abilities have changed. I've worked with some really amazing programmers. I've seen people who specialize very quickly. They seem to know what they want to do, and they've already looked into all the different specialties even while they're a junior. I've also seen people who don't really know how to optimize and don't know how the compiler even works. They seem to not know what all these flags are for and how to use them and how to restrict their use to a small section of code. So I'm not saying it's better or worse. It certainly has

 changed over time, but the tiers I just described of lead, senior, staff, and junior have pretty much in been in place and fairly frozen for a couple of decades, so I think it's safe to say you're going to find that at almost any company you would go to.

So I hope this answers the question, and I hope it gives you a little insight into how the games are made.

https://youtu.be/wTjm-e0eZ8E?si=n4Y7k1Q0asXbW1Lz

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim. Yesterday, I talked about the evolution of technology over my career, and I started to segue in that video into programming languages, and I said that could be its own video. Then I realized someone had asked me that exact question. Developer developer 67 asks, "Tim, can you compare C, C++, and C# and talk about your experiences making games with the languages early on in your own engines and later on in Unity for Pillars, and also tell us what did you enjoy more doing?" That's a good question and it ties in really good with yesterday's video.

Let me roll back a little. So before I jump into this, just as a reminder, I started my programming journey with BASIC on the Atari 800, and then that led me into assembly cuz I wanted to figure out how some of the games worked and the game a lot of the good really good games on the Atari 800 were in assembly. So that's what I started with, but then when my school had a computer science class, and it taught Pascal, so I learned Pascal. Pascal is my first compiled language. BASIC is interpreted, and assembly is, of course, just assembled. Pascal was the first compiled language where you write your code, you run it through a compiler and get an executable, and then you run the executable. It kind of blew my mind, the difference between compiled and interpreted. Interpreted was easy to learn because you could go right along, and you know you could sometimes just type it right in and run code that way. You could do type it in a line at a time and watch things happen, but Pascal was much faster than BASIC, the compiled Pascal, and it had a lot more powerful features, pointers, and all these other really cool things. And I, I learned my first debugging where you actually put breakpoints and ran code and saw where it break and saw what the current values of variables were, and that was fascinating, and that was high school.

When I went to college, I went to engineering school at the University of Virginia for computer science, and as part of that degree, I had to learn a ton of languages. It's where I first was exposed to C academically, but I'm going to put a pin in that, and C++ and a lot of other languages, snowball, lisp, Ada, just a bunch of different things. Now C, I learned C academically at UVA in the last year I was there, so '86, '87, but I had an overview class in '84 of a bunch of different languages, and C was one of them. And the year before that, in 1983, is when I started working on Grand Slam Bridge at Cybron, and that was written in C. So basically, I started doing a lot of work in C, professionally and in college, and so C was kind of my go-to language. It's what I understood; it's what I learned a lot of tricks in, you know, things like recursion where a function would call itself, so useful do using like arrays and to making structures with pointers and making just a whole bunch of different structures, link lists and doubly link lists and hash tables and vectors and just all kinds of things that you could build out of the basic fundamental pieces that C gave you.

I used C for all of my professional games from Grand Slam Bridge all the way up to Bloodlines. Bloodlines was in C++, but every other game, sorry, the dog decided now is a good time to play. So Grand Slam Bridge and Bard's Tale Construction Set and Rags to Riches and Fallout and Arcanum and Temple of Elemental Evil are all in C. So I had a really good grounding in how to use C for games. However, the engine, The Source engine which we used for Bloodlines, which came from Valve, was in C++. So we switched. Now a lot of people ask, "Why didn't you switch earlier?" I was asked that question a lot, in fact, I was asked that question in a very rude and direct way when we were shopping around Arcanum. Somebody basically said that I was an idiot, a potential publisher said that I was an idiot for not using C++, and my response was I compared C++ and C, usually the same compiler could do both, and I compared their output. I found optimization throughout the '90s worked way better on code than C++, and the resulting executables were smaller, and that combination just led to mainly work with C. You had to watch your memory and speed back then.

Now by the time Bloodlines came along, we didn't have a choice, and we use C++, and I was pleasantly surprised that optimization had gotten better. It wasn't perfect, even in the 2000s, you would frequently compile your code with some optimization flags, and it wouldn't work, but then you turn off the optimization flags, and it would work, meaning there was a bug in optimization. Then you look at the assembly, find out that it had unrolled a loop incorrectly or put in an incorrect jump, and you fix it. By the way, it shocked me to my core in the 2010s that there were professional programmers using C++ compilers that did not know you could do that. That what they would do is if something wasn't working, they would switch off all the optimization, and if it worked, they would either switch them on back on one at a time until it broke and then not use that optimization or they'd use pragmas to turn off optimization in certain parts of the code, but they never actually figured out why it was broken, they would just kind of work around it. Surprised me, but it's true.

So anyway, I started using C++ a lot from Bloodlines on. It was what we used in every game after Bloodlines, well, except for the Unity games, but I get to that. C++ to me as a C programmer felt like C with classes. Now, yes, C++ has a lot of other features, but I discovered that a lot of programmers want to use those features when they're not needed, and also when they lead to overly complex, hard-to-read code, and they would always deny that their code was hard to read, but sure enough, 6 months later, we'd have a bug, and we'd be back in their code. I'm like, "What are you doing here?" and they'd like, "Uh, I don't know, I don't remember," because their code was so obtuse. It was needlessly complex, and the two things I found made C++ code remarkably hard to go back to was when people overused operator overloading and inheritance. So operator overloading is when you're like, "I'm going to redefine plus to mean something else for this particular class," and inheritance is, "I'm going to have this method I can call, but on subclasses, I'm going to inherit from it, so this class inherits that function and does something different when it's called. Maybe it'll call the base function, maybe it won't." But what happens is you end up looking at code, and it looks like it's calling a function, and you think in your head you know what it's doing, but oh no, that one's that that method is overloaded, it's actually or it's inherited

, it's actually doing something else. So I found it abused a lot.

Now, don't get me wrong, overloading and inheritance are great techniques, in the wrong hands they're abused. I'll give you an example of where two excellent programmers, in my mind, would argue about things in C++. When we were working on Carbine, two programmers who I both thought were really smart were arguing over whether or not we were going to use the Standard Template Library (STL). One wanted to use it; he said, "We're wasting time here. We're reinventing the wheel. We're remaking link lists and hash tables and vectors. It's stupid. We should just use STL." Another programmer didn't want to use STL because he said, "A lot of them don't come with source code, so they're intensely hard to debug." So you run into, you're debugging something, and you're like, "I don't know if the bug was this was never put into the map, or the map is incorrectly not retrieving it." And they both made a really good case; it was really hard for me to decide. I think what we finally ended up doing is we found a very plain vanilla STL with source code, and I told people to use those if they wanted. Anyway, it was that's a good example of C++, there's so much you can do with it that you're tempted to do so much with it that things just become complicated when they don't need to be.

Anyway, Source was the first engine that I ever used that wasn't one that I made in-house, but we were back to in-house for WildStar, and while we did code the game in C++, I experimented with C# for the tools. I was, it was a lot easier to do UI in C#, and it was also a little faster to develop things in C#. It was once again you're back to a very simple, I believe it was interpreted, although you could compile it to, however, its optimization was terrible. This was 2005 to 2006. I wrote the same programs in C, C#, and C++, and the C# one was an order of magnitude slower than the other two. The other two would do something in a second that the C# one would take 30 seconds to do. I was using, I was doing image processing, like applying convolution matrices, kernels to do things like sharpen, blur, edge detect, emboss, those kinds of things, and the C# one was super slow. So I was very unimpressed with that.

When I went to Obsidian in 2011, we were back to using their in-house engine. It was all in C++. But I had to learn how to use it because the engine had been made for Dungeon Siege 3, and we were repurposing it for South Park, figured it out. But the very next game was Pillars, and this is where I finally like, "Oh, I'm probably going to have to use C#," because in Pillars, you have to either do Java or C#, and you don't really get to code the engine. The engine is opaque to you, but you get calls out, things like when your class starts, you get a call, every tick you get a call to your update, you can get calls when an event happens. You can say, "Hey, I need someone to call me when a status effect is applied to me," and then the status effect system when it applies something to someone says, "Call their event that a status effect has been applied." So you can do things like that. Turns out you have to do things like that because there was a lot of optimization issues we had where people tried to do everything on the update. It was very tempting to just wait until you get your update and then go, "Did I get a new status effect applied to me now? How would you know that?" You'd either have to keep a list of your old status effects, or you'd have to put a flag in on a status effect, and once you see it, you mark it as dirty, and then you see if there's any non-dirty status effects on you, which means they must have been recently applied. I saw people doing stuff like that in Unity's update function where what they should have been doing is listening for an event and have the class that does the thing they care about make an event. So C# not only was a little slow there, people were heavily abusing it, and it was slow. So we used Unity for Pillars of Eternity and Tyranny, but then when we went to Unreal, we jumped back to C++. And we did The Outer Worlds in C++. Not only was that faster, but you get the source code for the engine, so anything you don't like, you can change.

Now, one thing that Developer Developer asked was my experience, like what did I prefer. If I had to pick now, I would say if I had to pick a language to make a game, I pick C++ with C a very close second, and here's why. C++ is super powerful, the optimization and everything, all the compilers for it are really good now. It's easy to abuse it, but if you're careful, I think you can write really good code in C++. C would be my second choice because I'm super familiar with it. Compilers got really good with it for a while, although I wonder if that's leveled off. But also, C is very close to the metal, like if you know you need to do something, if you need to arrange data in memory a certain way, or you need to write out particular memory locations, C is great because it just lets you flat out do that. Plus, when you compile the code, there's a one-to-one from the C language to assembly, so you can look and go, "Yep, that's exactly how I would have done that if I had written it by hand."

And then C# would be my third one, but with a caveat. C# was by far the easiest one to learn. Now, for me, that might have been because I learned it after C and C++, but I found that among students too and new programmers. C# is just pretty easy to learn. So if you were going to start now, grab C#, grab Unity, learn how to code that way. However, I'd eventually, if I were you, go with C++. And that matches both my experience and what's used most commonly in the industry today.

So, I hope that answers your question, Developer Developer 67.

Quest Implementation.md

https://youtu.be/pw6tOlmwwYE?si=8rSELSrHwCYqV9TD

Hey everyone, it's me Tim, and today I want to talk about Quest implementation. Christy tenay 6130, I hope I got that name right, asks:

>Hi Tim, can you please explain more about how a quest system is created in code? Do you use a database or just classes? Are there variables only or entire records? And how do you change the quest dates and do branching depending on the various State paths provided and chosen by the players?

**Question**

Good question, and let me for a second just say why this is such a good question. I love that it is very specific. You didn't ask, "Hey, how do you make quests?" because I don't know if you mean code, I don't know if you mean design, I don't know if by Design you mean the idea of the quest or the specific implementation, how narrative factors in. No, very specific, how do you code it?

It's also a good example of asking a question about something that I forgot I ever didn't know. And this is going to sound strange, but let me just tell you how these things work, and it took me a long time to figure this out. When you first start in the game industry, you don't know anything, so you have a question about everything. After a while, you start to do these things, you learn like okay, this is good, I'm going to use this thing I've learned. After decades, you forget that you didn't even know that thing.

So, it never would have occurred to me to talk about this because I just assume people have played a bunch of RPGs, they know how this works.

So, it's something that a friend told me once, he said one nature of becoming an expert in something is early on in becoming an expert, you realize all the stuff you don't know. And then later, in being an expert, you forget all the things you didn't ever know, you forget the fact that you didn't never know those things. So, this is a good question. I want to talk about it. This is, I'm going to talk about a system we used in Fallout. It was the first time we had ever done anything like it.

So when I sat down to write the design docs on this section in Arcanum, I formalized all of this. And I'll talk about in States and how the states are adjusted, but I've used this particular formulation ever since. It was used in Arcanum, it was used in Temple of Elemental Evil, it was used in Vampire: Bloodlines, we were going to use something similar in WildStar, definitely used it in Outer Worlds.

So, let me talk about how it's coded.

**Code**

First of all, every Quest has a set of states it can go through. This could be an enumeration, it's unknown meaning the players never heard of it, mentioned meaning the quest has been mentioned, talked about, but the player was non-committal about it, accepted meaning they accepted the quest and that's all they've done, achieved meaning the objective of the quest was done but they haven't turned it in, some quests those may be the same thing, but I don't know, I'll leave that to the narrative designer, and then the fifth state is completed meaning the objective or objectives, and I'll talk about that, have all been done, have all been achieved, and now the quest is and the quest has been turned in, rewards have been given.

There's actually a sixth State called botched, which is any time actually you can set botched on any of the states except completed. Botched is handled specially in code. I use it as a flag on the quest date. So, Quest date is one of those enums I just mentioned, one of those five ones, and then you have botched, and that's because if an unknown Quest gets botched, depending on UI design, you may or may not tell players about it. I've seen some games when a quest I've never tried to get didn't even know about is botched, and I'm told about it when like the quest Giver gets killed.

I've also seen games and I've made games myself that if you kill a quest Giver, all the quests they give you internally are botched, but you're never told if you if if they're only in the unknown state. For mentioned, accepted, and achieved if they've been input in your quest log, sometimes mention quests go in quest log, sometimes they don't, then it gets moved to a botched section.

However, once a quest is completed, it's done, it's over, it's moved in the complete section. If you try to set the Bots flag, it doesn't let you. So, let's talk about that. So, I do all this in a quest class. The quest class has as variables the state, which is probably neenum, and the Box flag, and that's it. So, let's talk about the methods that you can put on this class, and yeah, I'm talking C plus plus just because that's the last time I implemented this.

You can set a state, so you on that particular Quest, you call set State, not botch, though. So, those are the five ones I have. Advancement is enforced here. Quests can only move forward. You can't go from mentioned to unknown, you can't go from achieved to mention. So, when that state is called, it only allows the quest state to advance from an earlier one to a later one. Um, but also, um, once the quest has been completed, cause to this the set state are ignored. So, you've completed it. I'm not, it won't accept any more State commands on that Quest.

You can also call get State. Now, get state is where you say if that botch flag is set, you return the botched State. Otherwise, you just return the state that it is. Now, here you can also decide if I don't tell the player that an unknown Quest is botched, if the state is unknown, you don't care what botched is, you just return unknown. So, that's something you have to decide in your game, how you're going to handle that.

And then there's a third, uh, or fourth, depending on how you look at it, a set of methods for botching and unboxing a quest. When you botch it, it turns on this the flag, and when you unbox it, it turns off that flag. Now, again, these methods don't work if the state's already been set to complete it.

**Implementation**

So, now you have a basic functional Quest class. How do you implement that? Well, I make a Quest array that is managed by a quest manager, which welcome to C plus, you're going to be making a Singleton here. It's the thing I don't like about the language. Every time I've made CL, well, not every time, but frequently when you make classes of things, you have to end up making a Singleton manager for those classes, and this is no different.

So, you just make a quest manager. The quest manager basically reads in, um, the quest data, and it's Mana, it reads in and saves that array, and it's what

 managed all of them. So, that way, it has a load, save. So, when the game says, "Hey, you need to save this person's game," the quest manager writes out the State and botched flag of all the quests.

And then you have to make, you have to put the set State, get State, and Bots and unbox as script calls. So, you basically expose them to your scripting language. I always have scripters handle the Quest State, and the reason for that is, it can be changed in so many ways. Like I said, you kill the quest manager, botch, you walk by someone on the street, and they're just talking about something, you know, like "I heard there's bandits down by the river," mentioned. You are in a dialogue with someone, and they're like, "Would you, did you hear about the bandits?" mentioned, "Would you deal with them?" player says yes, you set it to accept it. These have to be done in scripts because there's just so many places throughout the code that they can be changed, it's really hard to systematize that. So, it's that's the one thing I'm like here, here you are. It's probably these script calls tend to be caught a lot by narrative designers but also by your level designers who write Scripts.

Now, you notice I have Miss out a few things. I'm going to talk about some advanced um Quest stuff. You want maybe you want multiple objectives. So, to do this Quest, you have to do these three things. Just add extra variables into the quest class for those extra objectives, and they're when you call set State on achieved, you have to actually give it what objective that you're achieving. So, um, set State takes an optional parameter which has to be there if you're calling achieved, or you could just make a separate one and say set State doesn't work for achieved, and set State achieved it's its own thing that requires a parameter.

You can decide at this point whether or not um these have to be done in order or if any of these objectives are optional. And then what you can do is you can do Flags to control that. If if they have to do A, B, and C in order, then you can't set B as achieved before you set A. If it's A and B, and C is optional, then well, there's a rule that once you've achieved all of the objectives, the quest will return completed for its state, it will return completed even if the optional ones aren't done, and then it will once you have all of them, um, it can be completed. So, yeah, I'm sorry, it doesn't return completed, it can be set to completed if all of the non-optional states are marked as achieved.

So, I kind of just wanted to start at the end as I hear some things you could do to make a more modern Quest system with multiple States and optional States, but just to get started, I would do what I originally told you about, which is just make a quest which, you know, go get the crown of diamonds, which is hidden in this cave, you go get the crown, it goes for mention, you accept it, you go and when you as soon as you pick up that Crown, it's achieved, as soon as you go back to the quest giver and turn it in, complete it. Everything else from there is kind of an advanced set of things you can do, but they're not that hard, and I think if you're a programmer or you're a designer, you can just write that in, and your programmer will know what to do if you want to add States in order or optional States.

But in general, I've used this structure in so many games. It works well, it's tested, it's tried and true, and it will do pretty much everything that an RPG player expects from their quests.

So, I hope that answered your question, Christy tenay, and I hope that's how you say your name.

Quest Marker.md

Hi everyone, it's me Tim, and today I want to talk about Quest markers. Specifically, I want to answer a question from Wes 9353 who asks a question about Quest markers: what do you prefer, pointing at the quest item or Quest enemy, even if the enemy is invisible, or a quest marker that turns into a search radius, or no Quest marker, figure it out through dialogue or environmental storytelling? That's a good question, and the reason it's a good question is if you've played any of my games, you've seen that I have totally vacillated between all of those. I have gone from no Quest markers at all, like in Fallout and Arcanum, to Quest markers in areas like we did in Wildar, to Quest markers on the specific thing you're looking for in my latest games.

So here's the thing, if you do no Quest markers, there are people who would really dislike the game, and then some people love it. If you do area markers, there are some people who don't like it cuz they don't like having Quest markers, and then there's people who don't like it cuz they want them on something specific, and then there's other people who like it. And then if you do a marker right on the quest, whether it's an item or an NPC, again, there are some people like it, some people hate it. What you need to learn from this is, you will not make everybody happy, you just will not.

Now, I know someone clever out there's already thinking, well, why don't you just make it an option, or roll it in with the game difficulty if you don't want it to be a separate option. Here's why: I've worked with game developers who hate when you have any option at all that changes gameplay mechanics. Sound options, visual options, accessibility, yeah, but their attitude is, you really need to make up your mind on design mechanics and just put them in the game, and then difficulty should really be for things that make the like combat harder and certain skill uses harder, not "oh, we couldn't decide on a user interface for quests so we put it we rolled it into game difficulty."

Also, just so you know, I've seen players complain if a game allows game markers at all, even if they could turn them off in options. So if you think putting in options is going to solve it, there are game developers and game players who hate that. So you're not going to solve it that way. And also, so if you decide if the decision you make is let's not have uh game markers at all, know that everybody just looks things up online. Everybody. Uh, so unless the location of the thing they have to go look for is completely randomized like it's a person who walks around or it's an item that can be in one of five places, and you're not going to Mark where they are, they're going to look it up and they're just going to go to and even if it is is randomized, I'm sure enough people will play it will go it's in one of these five places, go look.

So, that's a lot of rambling and a lot of background, a lot of context, but let me tell you, if I had to pick one today, based on how I feel today and history with stuff with games, I would go with area markers for quests with the size of the area that the marker says it's referring to something that can be varied based on the quest, so the quest designer can decide what to do there. Now, specifically what I mean is, when someone's making a quest, they can say, hey, the monsters on dungeon level two in this part of the dungeon, or they may just say here's a quest marker at the front of the dungeon, it's the monster somewhere in the dungeon, or they may just put a quest marker in the valley and say boom with a big radius, the monster is somewhere in this Valley, and the player would have to discover oh it's in this dungeon level two up in the corner.

Why would I choose this? Well, because you can pick any radius you want, and by the way, I've played, I've worked on games where they let you make complex Quest area shapes. Personally, I just think a simple Circle where you pick the radius is fine. The reason I like this is if you pick a really tight radius, you can pretty much have Quest markers the way they're in games that put Quest markers on things. If you pick a big radius, saying it's somewhere in this Valley, you know the NPC may have told you that all the monsters located in this Valley, and then depending on what you set as where the marker is placed, if the marker is just at a random location in the valley or on the dungeon, or in a particular dungeon corner, or on the monster itself with a radius so you're still never quite sure where it is, all of these work for any different kind of uh design you want.

If you decide you really just wanted markers on the item or NPC, just put them on the item or NPC and put a small radius. If you decide I don't really want to do that, put it outside the dungeon with a big radius, and you have anything in between. Maybe you can make some quests work a certain way and some work others, and the player can tell when they look like oh it's somewhere in that loc area, and then if the radius is really small, it can just go there it is, that's the thing you want. If you wanted, you could even have the quest marker say something on it, so then the quest Giver can have it say here's the monster, or can say the monster is anywhere in this Valley, even though they can see that it's a marker with a big radius.

So that way, the player who's playing doesn't have to guess what you were thinking, he can just look at the quest marker and go oh, the monster is somewhere in this Valley. One thing I would support because I've seen this happen enough is multiple markers for one Quest. So it might be hey you, you have to find this item, but it could be in any of these five Dungeons, and it just marks all five Dungeons, and as you go to each one, maybe it can remove those markers or it may be I want you to go kill these five Bandits, it marks all five Bandits maybe with the radius, and then as you kill them, they get marked off.

The reason I think you should consider multiple markers per Quest is, I've seen enough good Quest designs that needed multiple markers and like radius since you put that under the player control, the uh Quest designer's control. If they only need one marker, that's the default, if but if they need multiple markers, it supports it. And multiple markers really come in when there's two cases: one where it could be in any of those locations or one where you have to go to all those locations. So it could be hey, gold may be found in any of these five mines, or maybe I want you to go mine gold in all five of these mines to get the quest completion.

So I think if I were to make a design today, I would do any Quest can have it defaults to one Quest marker, but you can add more if you want, and it defaults to a

 small circular radius, but the quest Giver can increase that if they want. I think that gives you the best of all worlds, and if you're making your game and you don't know what you want, it can be specialized into one of any of the other types very easily. So if you decide I don't want multiple markers and I want them to be on the creature, keep the default of one, don't use multiple markers, put them right on the creatures, and give them a very tiny radius. Or if you decide later, I want to use a smattering of all those, you've got it available. It's basically a tool, decide how you want to use it.

So I hope that answers your question, Wes 9353.

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim. Today, I'm going to try to answer several questions that I've gotten on the channel through comments. I was trying to make a video about each one of them, but they don't... I don't want to pad a video just to make 10 or 15 minutes, and I think I can do a number of comments if I just go through them all at once. So, I'm going to try to do that, see how that works.

Let's start with Lazar Satulovic 6484, who asks, "I wanted to ask you if you ever had any ideas for an RPG that is more grounded and set in a real-world historical setting. If not, what period would be, would you say, is your favorite or most influential or inspiring for designing your worlds?"

I will say I don't really have a real-world historical setting that is my favorite. Not a huge history buff. Um, I know it... one of my biggest complaints in high school to, uh, one of my teachers who was trying to get me to move from history to AP History was, "You have literally never taught me anything past World War II. Nothing. I don't know anything about the Vietnam War, don't know anything that happened in the literally the '50s, the '60s, the '70s, or the '80s." And so I told them unless you're going to teach me that in your AP History Class, I'm not interested. He got so mad, he took it up with my mother, who basically said, "I agree with my son," and I didn't take AP History.

So, while I don't have a historical setting, when push comes to shove, I probably like medieval settings the best, mainly because most of my games are, "Here's a setting with a twist." An Arcanum was, "Here's a medieval setting that had an industrial revolution." I like, you know, "Here's a medieval setting that may have zombies," or "Here's a medieval setting that may have, you know, a vampire," or whatever. I just, I find that setting a little more fun to design for because then once you get to modern day with police and guns, it's less interesting, and then when you get the future where it's like, "I've got scanners and I can beam out," I'm just, if, if I, if push came to shove, I'd probably pick around 14th century with a twist to make is my setting.

So, the next question, Sharp Dog 664 asks, "Hi Tim, I would love to hear your thoughts on catering and Food Service whilst you was working at Interplay, Troika, and currently what it is like an Obsidian. Do they have weekly dishes based on the games you create and so forth?"

I hate to break it to you, Sharp Dog, but there are no catering and food services at any of those companies. At Interplay, we may have been given food as a launch day celebration when your game shipped. Troika, we did it, we did three kinds of food: we did a regular weekly one, a crunch time one, and then a special when we ship the game, we had special celebrations for that, but usually we just brought stuff in from restaurants. Same thing at Carbine and Obsidian. Um, it was really common to get food, especially dinner, offered to during crunch. Uh, when games shipped, we had big launch parties. The Obsidian launch party for Outer Worlds, the food there was so fun. It was themed on the food from Outer Worlds. We had tarmac and cheese, we had a whole bunch of really fun stuff. But regular food service? No.

So, the next question, Power GI 3996 asks, "What is the difference between double A games like The Outer Worlds, I think, and you're right, and AAA games? Is it just scope and cost? Also, what are the differences between working on Double A games versus Triple A games, if any?"

So, Power GI, this was almost its own video because my answer for this is a little longer, and I'll give examples, but it boils down to it's mostly budget. Double A has a smaller budget than Triple A, but the budget means less time to make the game, a smaller team to make the game and to QA the game, smaller marketing budgets. There's some great games out there that you've never heard of because they don't have a marketing budget, and there are some good games out there that you've played and liked because it had an amazing marketing budget.

And then, um, budget also affects scope, but there's a caveat there, and that's what I wanted to mention. That's really why I wanted to answer your question. Budget tends to be linear. As budgets go up, it tends to be a linear increase, so you go from a 1 million to a 5 million to a 10 million game, and yeah, it goes up to 100 million, but scope is exponential. Every feature you add is exponential to the scope of the game because they all interact. I talk about often, there's a fabric, there's like a weave of design.

I'll give you an example. I've in the past, I've told people I kind of wish I had taken newspapers out of Arcanum because a lot of work went into them, but they're really only connected to quests. And let me tell you, let me give you an example of what, how scope works, how everything gets interconnected, and why I mentioned newspapers. So, in Arcanum, you could hear rumors from people. There was a whole, it was systemic. These are all systemic things. So, a designer could just put our colon in his dialogue, I have a whole video on generated dialogue, and that could generate a rumor which could lead to a nearby in dungeon or attacking bandits or whatever, and that would be a quest, a side quest. Quests themselves exist that the players could put in, and those also had generated dialogue op codes they could put them in, and um, quests could advance the story state, and the story state was also systemic. It was something that was stored, so at any particular time, someone could say, "What's our story state?" and it could tell you where in the linear storyline you currently were, even if you were getting to that point in the linear storyline in a non-linear way.

So, those are all systemic features of Arcanum, and then I added the newspaper, which was also systemic. What it was supposed to do is connect to each one of those. You were supposed to be able to read the newspaper and possibly get a rumor which could then lead to quests. You could read the newspaper and directly get a quest from it. You could read the newspaper and see what the story state was. All we really ended up shipping with was quests could, when they change state, inject something into the newspaper queue. Cues were generated randomly, newspaper headlines were generated randomly, but they'd also looked a story state to see if something major should be said. Quest could inject things saying, "Hey, at the next newspaper, say this." So like, if you burn down a factory in Tarant, I think that got injected as a newspaper headline.

So, newspapers and rumors and quests

 and story states, we're all supposed to interact a lot more than they did. Why didn't they? Budget ran out of time to do it. Why didn't I remove newspapers? Because, as I like to remind producers, removing something doesn't save time. Removing something takes time. If I were to remove newspapers, we'd have to fix up what when quests were planning to inject stuff in the newspapers because it wasn't enough just to make that injection do nothing because maybe the quest person would like, well, I need some other way for the player to know that this quest changed something in the world. We'd have to figure out some other way. Maybe it would become the quest giver would just tell you right then when you finished the quest and change the state rather than have it go into the newspaper, and they would just tell you. But even then, that was kind of, some people had planned for the newspaper to be the way it got conveyed. So, I wish newspapers had been much bigger than they were, and if I'd known there would be as small as this, I wouldn't have put them in, but even taking them out wasn't possible because we didn't have the budget for it. And yes, Outer Worlds was double A, not Triple A, which is why it was shorter, which why its feature set wasn't as big as what I wanted, which is why Monarch wasn't as big as what I wanted. It's all goes down to budget.

Anjin Filipovic 2851 asks, "Is there a better way to make an encounter with a high-level boss or enemy than just more hit points? It's 2023, and I still feel the majority of RPGs use the same old boring concept of bullet sponge, which makes the game just more tedious and not hard or challenging."

Oh yeah, there's a whole bunch of things you can do with bosses, and I've seen these in games, and I know you know what they are. One, one I love is stages, and I mean that both the actual physical realized stage that the boss is on and also a phase-based one. So, the physical stage is when the area the boss is fighting it actually matters, when there's cover, when there are things you can adjust to create pits or lava that can damage you when you go into, when it's, you have to watch out for hazards in the world in addition to the boss, when there are hazards you can get the boss into. Those are all ways of making fun boss encounters that have more to do with the area the boss is in than the boss itself.

But there's also phased-based stages that a boss can go through, and you've, I know you've seen this, where over time, the boss changes. He may change physically, he may change what attacks he has, he may change what defenses he has. And what's great about that is mostly the telegraph to the player somehow, like all of a sudden, you know, he turns, you know, to a different shape, or he had now as a shield, or whatever, so he won't get damaged as much. You have to do something else. These are all, those phase-based ones are really good ways of making interesting boss fights because the player has to react to him rather than just shove as much damage into the boss as possible.

Another thing you can do to make bosses more interesting is to give them henchmen, give them extra things, you know, um, creatures on that stage that they're fighting on that fight for them. And a lot of times, these are just trash mobs. But trash mobs are important because not only are they fun for you to do AOE spells on, but a lot of games have things, mechanics, that whenever you kill something, you get a bonus. I'm falling forward to that. Whenever you killed something, you would get, if you had a certain perk, you could increase your critical hit or um, even bank it if you had another perk. So, there was a myrler queen boss that would shoot out these little mirelurk spawn. Those were great if you had a luck-based character and you had those perks for shooting a spawn, getting a bunch of critical hits banked, and then using them on the mirelurk queen. That was cool.

Other things you can do, especially in RPGs, is you can have some pretty high hit point henchmen helping the boss that you've met before, maybe you've met them in the storyline, you've done quests for them, or quests that involved them, and then boom, there they are with the boss, helping them out. And you know, oh God, that guy's got that really powerful laser, that guy's a sniper rifle, or that guy does this AOE attack. They can, the telegraphing of the attacks they do occurred in earlier encounters you had with the boss's henchmen who then show up to help him. You can also just have low hit point henchmen that just exist to sap your health or your mana or create hazards or do whatever they're going to do. Um, but that's a way you can make a boss a lot more interesting than just putting health on them.

Stavros Nicolau and many other people asked a question, "Do you feel similarly unconcerned about saves coming, or is that behavior something worth mitigating by design? In the latter case, what are some good ways to prevent or minimize saves coming?"

I think what he meant, I wasn't, I was unconcerned with, I believe it was, um, speedruns, and all I can tell you is I'm completely unconcerned with saves coming. I don't care. Most of my games let you save anywhere. I even let you save in the middle of combat in my games, and there's a lot of games that, why they let you save anywhere, they disable saving in combat, just because there's a lot of game state associated with combat. So, making a save game that works in combat is a lot of extra work, but I, I thought it was useful, and I, I don't mind if people want to save anywhere. I, I understand the frustration of if there are places, checkpoints that you could say, that you have to redo a lot of things over and over and over again because a designer thought, well, if you, I don't want you to save right before this encounter or right before this thing. And yes, save scumming means people can save right before picking a lock or save right before a particular combat or save right before you're going to go into a conversation and try to use your speech skills. I'm okay with that. It's, to me, what's part of an RPG.

And then finally, because wow, I'm going a long time, Hollow 8136 asks, "So, I'd really love to hear your general thoughts on asset reuse and what goes into the decision-making for what needs new assets and what can reuse or retool existing ones."

That's a good question, Hollow. I personally like asset reuse, and I'm assuming you mean more than just art asset reuse because even though like a Troika, we had very little art asset reuse in our games because we made two isometric and then a 3D, and the two isometric had such a different art look. But

 Arcanum and Temple did use the same engine with modifications. I think Bethesda's done a really good job of reusing the same engine for decades, and Fallout: New Vegas was only made because, in that short period of time, because they got to reuse a lot of assets that were already supplied with the engine. So, I'm all for asset reuse.

I think there is a group of developers who want to make brand new stuff for every new game they make, even if they're now currently reusing engines like they use Unity or Unreal or their own internal engine for every game. But for me, I'm like, if there's a, if you can reuse assets, trees, rocks, textures, engine components, sound effects, anything like that, if it makes sense to reuse them, I really don't believe in remaking the wheel every time. I do think you should make new stuff. I don't want to make just a game where you're reshuffling assets like a deck of cards, but I think judicious use of reuse of assets is a smart game development technique. I wish more companies would do that just so games could be made a little faster.

Okay, I think that's enough questions for today. I hope I answered a lot of people's questions, and I will do this again when I've got another stack of questions that have shorter answers.
Title:
Research

Youtube Link:
https://youtu.be/kNpSGR7bRW4?si=j8ClIrZk11zbihBz

Hi everyone, it's me Tim, and today I want to talk about research, specifically the research that you do when you first start a game. I got a very detailed question on the channel from Lazar Satvic, who asked, "This might be a very lengthy topic, but I'm interested to hear you talk about the research phase of game development. I have a couple of sub-questions about it. Obviously, research is very important for games that are set into historical settings or games that want to accurately depict real modern-day cities. So, how important was research in Fallout, Arcanum, in the Outer Worlds, which aren't tied down that way? Does research only happen during the early stages of development, or does it last throughout production? Can there be additional research during the later stages of production if the need arises? Which are some of the things you personally researched while designing your games? I think you may have touched on this a bit when you talked about FE."

Okay, that is quite the set of questions, and I'm going to try to answer all of them. I even dug up some Arcanum research that I did, so I will get to that. This could be long, grab some coffee. I'm going to try to answer it in detail because that was a lot of questions and they all deserve an answer. But before I start, let me say what I'm going to assume you mean by research. Actually, no, before I even do that, I'm going to assume you already have a setting because remember, I always say it goes: you make a set, you decide on a setting, then you decide on your story, then you decide on your system mechanics. I'm going to assume you've at least picked a setting; otherwise, you're not really doing re... well, you call it research; you're basically casting about for the base idea of your game. Remember, I consider setting to be the first and most fundamental decision you can make, so I'm going to assume you already have a setting. 

So now you want to do research about that setting. Yes, I do research in the standard way of, you know, going to the library or going online now and reading history, reading about science, uh, facts and science development, but I also include as part of that research books, movies, TV shows, board games, other video games that share that setting that you've decided on because those can really really assist you in developing your game both in what you liked about those things and didn't like. I have a whole video about the influences that went into Fallout, and I talked about movies and books and TV shows and other games, and some of them we weren't trying to copy them; there was some element we liked. For example, in "A Boy and His Dog," we liked the setting and some of the decisions they made in it. The story was oh, the dialogue. "Road Warrior" was a huge influence on how we looked, not just the setting; we had a very similar setting to "Road Warrior" and what happened. Ator, but we liked the look despite the fact that it kind of implied that after a nuclear war, you not only still had access to hair stylists, but those stylists had access to Moose and hair gel and other hair styling products, and everybody dressed like they wanted to be fashionable and be about to appear in an '80s Duran Duran video. But we liked that; that was an influence on us. So you don't have to, you don't, when you're doing research, you don't have to look for things that are justifiable; you do your research, decide these are the elements of that setting that I love, maybe I should put them in my game. Now you may find that you like a lot of things, and they're not mutually compatible, so you don't have to put everything you discover in your game; some things don't belong together. But sometimes the juxtaposition of two things that aren't quite usually supposed Fallout, you know, '50s and the future, that worked really well for us.

So I'm assuming you're doing that kind of research. So many of my games, as you pointed out, were historical offshoots, so Fallout diverged at some point from our history. The Outer Worlds diverged at some point from our actual history. Arcanum was different in that it was, what we did is we took a very Lord of the Rings-style fantasy world and then said boom, it has an industrial revolution. Now we actually tried to define that, and that's why I dug up, I actually wrote a document that I found in my many many many many notes called Victorian times. I wrote this, I started writing this in '98, the last time I touched it looks like September 2000. What I did is I even said this document lists the prevailing social and environmental issues during the Victoria era. This era is defined as 1837 through 1901, the reign of Queen Victoria in Great Britain. This era was represented by such 19th-century ideals as devotion to family life, public and private responsibility, and obedience to law. The prevalent morals, manners, and tastes have been described as prudish, narrow, pompous, hypocritical, ornate, and eclectic. And Arcanum will explore many of those stereotypes. It goes on for six, eight pages. It's a long, it's, it's not a huge document, but what I did was I wrote all these things down so that when we were doing quests and character dialogues and just trying to come up with new locations, people could look at this document and go, this is kind of what we've agreed on are things that happened historically in Great Britain that we wanted to touch on in Great Britain. And I'll go over it.

So I talked about coal, not just as a form of power but also for its use in metallurgical stuff like steel. So it drove engineering development. Pollution, which I talked about how pollution affected particular trades where chimney sweeps got cancer, cancer of the scrotum. Hat makers, Hatters often went crazy because they used nerve-destroying Mercury salts to treat felt; that's where the phrase "Mad Hatter" or "Mad as a Hatter" came from. And bootblacks often got liver damage from the solvents they used to polish boots. But then I had a very specific one on air pollution, which really became an issue in the 18th and 19th century, and that's when it first became a major problem. People reported issues as early as 1661, but it wasn't until the 1900s, or 1700s through 1800s, that people really started to go, this is becoming a problem. There's a whole section on corsets and their use, and there's a whole section on railroad magnates, which is something we used because we wanted railroads to be a big part of the Arcanum world. We, there's a section on missionary work, on exploration of parts of the world that weren't known to the Victorians. We talked about, I talked about fox hunting and ballooning and what roles those had in the world. Talked about boxing and how that was revived in London, and there were prize fights in the 18th century. I talk about catalog ordering, which became a big

 thing and was being used by people to bypass wholesalers and retailers, and the reason it worked was because of the rise of steamboats and railroads to deliver things. And if you look at a Sears catalog, we actually went to a bookstore and found an old Sears catalog from the very early 1900s. People were ordering houses; you would order a kit that was a put-together house that you knew you could, you could do yourself. There were so many things that you could order on mail order catalogs. It was like the Amazon of 1901. We, we talked about the discovery of fossils and how that was changing science and creating paleontology. Heavier than air flying machines, which were becoming a thing. So ballooning became a pastime, where heavier than air became a transportation network. Opera Houses, which were very popular in the late 1800s. The construction of dams for power generation and flood control. Photoplays, which were very primitive motion pictures. How schooling worked, what common ailments there were. We looked up grip, consumption, dropsy, puracy, and I described what all of those were. Infant mortality, which was surprisingly low, and then soared into the industrial revolution. The use of child labor. Again, how education worked, labor strikes, and then women's suffrage and women getting involved in politics. These were all things that I wrote historical events for, so people could address them in our game. These were things Arcanum was a very, did a lot of commentary on social things. A lot of people go, well, isn't it, isn't that being racist or sexist? We were addressing those issues through the lens of a fantasy game.

So, that was a lot of the research I did for that, and that was done at the very beginning. And yes, I will say that to answer your question, a lot of research is done before you start. Like, you have the setting, boom, let's do research. So we looked up a lot of stuff about radiation and how big and how much effect bombs had, nuclear bombs had when we started Fallout. When we did Arcanum, I reread Lord of the Rings; I still reread it occasionally, I love that book. In addition, we did research, like I just pointed out, on the effects of the Industrial Revolution in England and especially in London. Tant was obviously modeled after London. However, we also did a lot of research during the game because things would come up, and we realize we don't really know enough about that, or the research we did before we started is too shallow to support we want to do. So you have to do, or and it could come up for different reasons, maybe somebody's trying to write a quest, and they don't quite understand something, or maybe you have a character who really would talk about something in more detail than you've done in the research. That's when I did, I did a deep dive into microbiology research during Fallout about Vons, V-I-R-I-O-N-S because the FEV, one of, there's a microbiology report you could find somewhere that's saying it's not really a virus per se, it's a viron. And I wrote all the stuff I had researched, and that really went into kind of influencing what FEV was. There was also a book called "At Least a Terrifying Tale of Immortality" about a woman who just happened to be born, instead of with a double helix, she was born with a quadruple helix, and it made her mortal. I kind of took that idea and said, well, what if FEV did that? What if one of the things FEV did was duplicate your helix? Because that would really, really help you in many ways; it would make you radiation resistant because instead of having to knock out one element from a DNA, you still have another strand to know what that, what we got because everything pairs exactly one to one on DNA strands. But if you had two double helixes, every time something got lost, you not only had an exact copy of it, but you had two things that confirmed what that copy was. So I said, well, in addition to being longer lived, they should be radiation resistant, and then we said, and what if it does other things, like makes you really big, and you know, you become a super mutant. I thought ghouls were radiation something. I wish I'd written down, but we all disagreed on that, especially where Harold was involved. But I did write a detailed description of how Vons worked and how they, that was for FEV. To the extent that a German microbiologist wrote us after we shipped and said, you guys did a really good job with that description of FEV. So I was like, yeah. And this goes back to what I say about lore. I did a video on lore. Sometimes you put things in because most of the people playing the game won't care, and if they do care, they won't even get it, but the right people will get it, as Leonard said.

So, I think that's everything. I think I hope that answered all your questions, Lazar. Research is really important. You start it early, but you may have to do it in the middle of the game. And research can be anything from looking up scientific and historical facts to watching movies and TV shows, reading books, and playing games of all kinds set in the same setting you're doing, just to see what other people have done and what you like and don't like. So I hope that answers all the questions you had about research.

School vs Self Taught.md

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim. Today I want to talk about the pros and cons of going to school versus being self-taught if you want to go in the game industry. And remember, this is from my point of view of going to school to learn programming, but this probably has equal measure for Art and Design and other roles that you want to do in games. So let me talk about for a second, yesterday I talked about a university class that I taught because I love being in school and I've said that I really liked being at UCI so it was nice to come back and give a little back. A few weeks before that I talked about how my love for school and all the skills that I think I learned while in school, whether from school or just people I went to school with, the skills that I learned to make games. So this is kind of on top of those.

I've been accused in the past, and I'm sure it's happening in comments now, that I'm anti-self-taught, and that is not true. I went to school, school was great for me, but one of the best programmers I ever worked with was entirely self-taught. The programming director at Interplay, Jay Patel, was self-taught, and I learned a ton from that man. He was a really, really good programmer and knew techniques that I didn't learn in school.

Which let me go over what I think the pros and cons are of going to school to learn whatever topic you want to learn about, and that will lead me into some pros and cons I think when people are looking for a job or thinking of switching jobs in the game industry.

So let me talk about pros and cons. I think the obvious pro of going to school is it is something a lot of employers look for. If you have a degree, they're like, "Oh good, you have a degree in programming or you have a degree in art or you went to Full Sail or you went to DigiPen. Great." But what they're really looking for is experience, and yes, school is a kind of experience, work is experience. And I see people go, "How do I get experience? How do I get work experience if no one will hire me?" And I've said this: demos. People who come in and go, "I wish to make games, and I wish to code user interface. Here is a game demo I made with a really nice user interface." Those people go to the front of the queue. And honestly, there's not a lot stopping you from doing that, especially in this day and age. Got a whole video about that.

But some of the there are other pros to going to school, other than "Hey, that's what people look for." First of all, schools, and especially universities, are very structured places for learning. They've been doing it a long time; they kind of know what they're doing. They provide classes on specific topics, additional study sessions with and without a TA on those particular topics. I was never more frustrated as a grad student than when people said the class was too hard and the teacher wasn't good, and I was the TA, and I never saw them at... I had two different sessions a week, and I never saw this. I'm like, "I don't even know who you are. How did you never ever come to a study session and then at the end of the quarter decide this class was bad?"

So universities are designed to help people study, and it's not just the classes, it's the surroundings. They're very conducive to studying. There are libraries, there are usually big open green areas if you want to sit outside, there's lots of quiet areas to tuck into and study, and lots of other people are doing it too. So it's easy to study when you look around and everybody else is studying too. And that's actually leads me into the thing about being groups. I know a lot of people don't like working in groups, but when you're in a school and you're studying in a group, this is great because you have fellow students you can ask questions to, maybe they just figured it out and they thought of a way of thinking about it. You can study together, you can work through problems together, and figure things out. A lot of people don't do that, and they don't make use of the fact that they're in this class with 20, 30, hundreds of other people. You can make use of that.

And if you are someone who likes learning on your own, you can still learn on your own. No one's going to stop you. No one. If you want to study a topic that there's no class for, or you want to go a little farther ahead and maybe read some chapters in the book in your class that aren't assigned, you can do that. And especially if you're you have a light quarter, a light semester, you know, you're only taking three or four classes instead of five or six, or it's the summer and you're working, maybe you can you know study a little bit outside that.

So those are all the advantages I see to going to school, other than just "Here's a degree."

Now, there are a lot of cons to going to school too. I just mentioned working in a group, and I've talked being in school will teach you all the negative things about being in a group, which you will encounter when you get in the game industry. You have to work with a bunch of people. Some of these people won't do their job, and they will decry any attempt that anyone point out they're not doing their job. They're literally not getting their work done, and they will hide that fact, and they will argue that they are, or they will argue they were given too much work. There's a lot of things that will happen. Yes, sometimes there's a really bad manager who threw too much work on someone, and then they got buried. But there's usually more than one person on a project, you know, the game director doesn't exist in a vacuum. He's got a boss; they're producers and APs. So I usually find that when people are in a group and they're complaining about other people in the group, it's not as bad in the game industry as it was at University. You're often assigned into a group by a teacher, and then at the end of the quarter semester, you're like, "Here's our project," and there's nobody to deal with. There's nobody to go to, except the teacher, if you're having trouble with someone on the group. And this will happen, I guarantee you. You may have a few good groups, but eventually, you're going to get in with a bad group, and there's going to be that one person who wants to coast, or the one person who's in over their head and doesn't know how to do what you're trying to do.

Another con of being at the university is you kind of have to go at the speed of the class. Now, yeah, you can read ahead and everything, but some people get bored at the rate at which a class is going, or they get overwhelmed quickly. You start a class, and it's got a prereq, and you don't remember everything from that class, and now you

're over your head. They're like, "Oh God, they expected me to remember querying, oh shoot." The nice thing about studying on your own is you can go at your own speed, and that's good if you have that self-motivation to keep you going.

Another con of university is to get a degree, you have to take a lot of classes, and frequently you will find yourself in classes that you don't care about. You know you're not going to ever use this, you're not interested in it, but you have to take it. And I will tell you, I went to an engineering school for my undergraduate degree. I was given a lot of classes in things I'm like, "Thermodynamics is interesting, but I don't really care about it, and I don't see me using this as a programmer." But I had to take it because every engineering student had to take these four or five core classes their second year.

A big con of university is that you often aren't taught what you want or what you need to know. When I was was coming back to UCI to teach, and I was talking to Dan Frost, who I was co-teaching with, I said, "By the way, I have a huge complaint about what I was taught at UCI because there were huge holes in my knowledge. I was never taught how to debug or how to optimize code. It never comes up. You're taught data structures and algorithms and neuron nets and automa theory and all these different things, but no one ever says, 'Hey, when you're going to code something, and it doesn't work, how do you fix it? Hey, you're going to code this, and it uses too much memory or runs slowly, how do you fix that?' No one teaches you that."

When I mentioned it to him, he said, "Yeah, a lot of professors here are against that." So I went to talk to the dean of the school, who used to be my thesis advisor, and his response was interesting. He said, "It sounds like you want to make UCI into a trade school." And I was like, "No, but if you think even academic programmers don't need to know how to debug and optimize, that that's insane." I saw it happen. We got a supercomputer at UCI, and it had like a giga memory, and the first thing a physics teacher did, physics professor for research, was he allocated a 1,000 by 1,000 by 1,000 array. Boom, all the memory's gone. You know, sparse arrays do exist; you could have used that.

Which gets me into another con of University: there are some really bad teachers. There are people who don't really have any connection to what degrees are used for in this day and age, or they're just bad at getting their ideas across, or they're strict in ways that don't need to be, and then aren't strict in places they should be. And let me tell you something: I had a teacher at University of Virginia who was so bad that we would get in arguments. I got a better grade in their class than they thought I should deserve, but they had to give it to me. I complained about this teacher to the dean while I was still there, and when I got my first alumni letter about donating, I said, "I cannot in good conscience donate one dime to this school as long as teachers like this get tenure." So I've had my bad experience, but don't get me wrong, I loved my time at the University of Virginia. I just, that one teacher was so bad that it just left this... They made me hate math for a while. That's how bad they were. They taught a math class, and they did such a bad job at teaching it and were so unnecessarily mean that it just made me go, "I don't want to do... I just don't want to do math anymore. I don't want to be anywhere near this department."

So that can happen, and if it happens to you, my best recommendation is to try to compartmentalize it: "I don't like that teacher, but I do like UVA, and I do like school."

The final, well, the second to the last con I can think of, is in this day and age, there are online videos that teach you almost anything, and you can learn it on your own. And as long as you don't need someone to talk to, to ask questions of, you can learn a lot more from videos and at your own pace than you can learn from school. And that's true for not just, like I've said, learning game engines, but learning code, art, any program or tool you want to use is probably a video that explains how to use it. So it makes me look at University and go, "Hm, there's a lot of stuff I can already learn that you teach." Still think it's good, but maybe not as good.

And then, finally, the university is expensive, and trust me, I know that. I wouldn't had used student loans when I was an undergraduate, and I did work-study, and I got help from my mom. I still went into debt. When I went to grad school, that debt was suspended, and luckily, I got a scholarship for grad school, and I did work. I worked as a TA and an RA, a research assistant, in grad school school. But as soon as I graduated and went to Interplay, boom, all my student loans became due, and I found myself paying rent and a car payment and all the things you have to pay, and then student loans on top of that. And it was rough; it was rough. So I see why people want to avoid that.

And so I hope giving this list of pros and cons makes you realize that deciding whether or not to go to school and where to go to school was a very personal thing. And for me, it's very similar to when people come to me at work and say they're thinking of quitting. I usually ask them why, like, what is it that's bothering you here, and what do you think you're going to get if you go somewhere else? Because I always warn them, the first thing I say is the grass isn't greener at other companies. What it basically, what I see it is, is different companies promote different things. They're good at some things and bad at others. What you need to figure out is what you care about, what do you really need in a work environment versus what you want and like in a work environment versus things that bug you or just annoy you so much that you can't work in a work environment that doesn't provide it.

Some people want flexible hours, some people demand work from home, some people want good insurance, some people want longer vacation, parental leave. These are all good things to have, but you have to realize some people don't care anything about those things. You may go, "Good people don't care about good insurance?" I've met a lot of 20-somethings who don't have a primary care physician, don't go to the dentist, you know, they have... they're still in that "I'm immortal" phase, and "I will never ever be hurt." They don't really look or care about

 good insurance. They may care about flexible hours and long vacation. Single people may never even glance at the parental leave that a company provides. Why would they care?

So you have to realize this is a personal thing, what companies offer and what people care about are very different. So you may have someone, a friend of yours, go, "Oh, I love it at this company," and you go there, and you're like, "This is terrible. The parental leave is awful, the insurance is awful," and they're like, "I don't care about that."

So my recommendation is when you go to interview at a company, look for those things, look for the things you care about. Figure out what you care about first, and then look for them, and then ask if you don't see it. Ask the people interviewing you if you have an opportunity. If you go to lunch and they bring some other employees, ask them. Take an opportunity to do that.

This is exactly what I tell people to do about school. Figure out what you want to get out of it and what you need. If you need structure, if you need fellow people to work with, to study with, if you need an environment that is designed to help you study, you might want to go to school. If you want to learn at your own pace, if you can watch a video and go, "I understand Unity now. I understand C++," you just... you may want to skip school. But then, when you go to an interview, I hope you bring along a demo.

So those are my thoughts on school and the pros and cons of going there. For me, it was mostly a pro with some con. For some people, it's a lot of con. So that's my idea on School versus self-taught.

Setting Ideas.md
Youtube Link:
https://youtu.be/FF8v31SwjEM?si=GqgPiomBq4a67U9m

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim. Today I want to talk about setting ideas. I've talked about brainstorming, I've talked about doing design documents, and that I always start with the setting before I do story, and then I do system mechanics. So I thought I'd just talk about ideas for settings, kind of going to walk you through Star Raiders, kind of how I do my notebooks, kind of ties into brainstorming, but I'm just going to talk about like kind of what I even do now and how I come up with setting ideas.

So, weeks ago I showed a little game I made in three days based on an old Atari game called Star Raiders, where the ship flying around doing combat, you could pick up cargo and let you upgrade the ship. Well, I've actually been designing a much bigger game that that would be part of, because I want to do exploration, I want to storyline. I mean, I realize this is starting to sound like Starfield, but I'm talking about something that I would make all by myself, just for funsies. So don't think Starfield, think vampire survivors but with a ship instead of a person and in space, and instead of monsters it's other spaceships.

Lord of Light, so I kind of have that quasi-designed. I may actually see what I can do with it. My big limitation right now is Art, so I'm making things with whatever art I can find on the Unity store, but I may continue with that. I also recently went back and wrote my notes on how I do a Lord of Light game, which I think would be really cool, but that one's heavily story-based, and I learned my lesson with Temple. I'm not going to try to write characters, but it was fun to read it again.

But then that got me into another setting I designed which starts like a magic game, but then it turns out it's really Tech, and then it turns out the whole thing is post-apocalyptic. It reminded me of Lord of Light, kind of reminds me of an old cartoon called Thundar the Barbarian if any of you people remember that cartoon which it was magic but it was set after a nuclear war or something on Earth, is very bizarre. This game wouldn't necessarily be set on Earth, or is it?

Looking through all my Arcanum notes, I found a bunch of ideas I had on trying to make turn-based better, just kind of improving turn-based or making it more enjoyable for people who prefer real-time. But my biggest problem with real-time in a lot of games is when it's my turn, I don't want anything moving. So one of the ideas I had was everybody rolls initiative like Fallout, Arcanum, Temple, but all the monsters that are contiguous have initiatives where they'd all go one after the other without any player characters in between, you just collapse them and they all take their turn together. Or if you even want to take that farther, all enemies just get one initiative roll and then they go. So it's just you playing by your single-player character, then you'd go, then all the creatures would go at once, then you'd go, then all the creatures would go at once. Initiative did a couple of simulations of that and found out that there's advantages and disadvantages for the monsters to go at the same time.

So one of the advantages, of course, is in a game like Temple where you get flanking, if they both can go together, then they can both get on either side of the player character, and they both get flanking. Where if they had to go individually, the first one wouldn't get flanking, and then the second one would. There's a similar disadvantage where if they both come down to the player character and the first one hits and kills the player character, the second one now doesn't have enough points move points to go anywhere else. Looks like the pros and cons from lumping all the monsters together kind of even out, certainly makes turn-based a lot faster but still gives me what I want in turn-based, which is on my turn nothing's moving so I can click on things, I can decide what to do, I can put area of effects to cover exactly the creatures I want. So I kind of like that. Fallout, put all those notes on one side, said if I ever do another turn-based game, I'm doing something like that.

Of course, I found my old Fallout design, just to remind people, over 15 years ago, maybe even more than 20. I wrote down an entire design for a new Fallout game. I never tell people about it because I've seen ideas of mine show up in other games, and I've watched people I know go, "if they've stolen my idea," and I'm like, "no, they haven't." A lot of people come from the same, you know, games and backgrounds, and ideas are a dime a dozen, and lots of people have the same idea, it's just how it's implemented, sometimes it's just who gets there first. So I have no doubt that I will see some elements of my Fallout game in new games, maybe even new Fallout games, but I know it's a coincidence because nobody knows about it but me.

However, one post-apoc world I am willing to talk about that I thought was an interesting idea was, I did a post-apoc world that was caused by a virus, but the virus was really engineered by an AI. Because the whole Terminator thing, I never got because why would Skynet just destroy so much of the planet, including stuff it needs and resources. It would want to get rid of humans, just release a virus already, it's not going to affect any of your robots, and the humans will all die. It's dumb that it didn't do that. But anyway, what I really liked about this game was the main character was a child, and what I loved about that was children, it not only let you do some things that were really interesting, like a child can get into places because they're so small, they get into vents, you don't have to make gigantic vents for an adult to get into, you can make places that kids can slide under fences, can get into vents.

But also, a child can't read, to or even understand a lot of stuff, especially if this child was really young when the apocalypse happened. So I love that warning signs would be in gobbledygook, warning messages, computers were just, you have no idea, it's just random or garble, and you're just even if you're playing as an adult now, you're just trying to work your way through all the stuff that you do not understand. You may understand the word warning, but then you don't understand anything that comes after that. I think that's fun and funny, and kind of realistic. Limbo, I remember when I suggested this, I've had multiple people go, "you can't have the main character be a child and possibly get hurt," and I at the time I was like, "I think you can," but then Limbo came out, the game Limbo, and I'm like, "hello, child main character dying in horrific ways." It's even worse when you turn on the mode that makes it black out the screen when your character is going to get killed because then you just hear a gruesome death

 of a child. So, I don't think this is a big deal anymore, but you know, we also don't have to have the death be gruesome.

In fact, I there was one game I designed where I wanted the um, I wanted the game to be done in one art style, and then when the character, when the child died, it would melt away and you'd see what was what the world was really like, in other words, the child was imagining this. And I told this to an artist who just went, "so you want us to do two disjoint art styles and completely double up our art load just so you can have that really interesting death mechanic?" And I'm like, "yes." They weren't having that.

So I was going through my notes, this led me down the post-apocalyptic rabbit hole, I wrote down what I thought every different way you could make a post-apocalyptic game. So let me share those setting ideas with you right now. The first one's War, not the given, you just know what it is, humans fight, devastate the planet, whether it's with nukes or just regular bombs, or just they've just wrecked everything. Wars, apocalyptic. Radiation, the next one was radiation, which could be nuclear weapons, but you could have solar flares, you could have power plant accidents, you could have laboratory leaks, there's all different ways you could have radiation leading to a post-apocalyptic world, which then led me to the third way, which is plague.

Uh, interesting, I wrote this all up, uh, 15, 20 years ago, wait a minute, it's dated 2002, this file, so 20 years ago. So this is not COVID related, but one kind of plague is natural, or accidental, we still don't know what's going on, another one is terrorist, that's, you know, just, that's kind of what my AI one was, that my AI post-apocalyptic, the AI made a virus just to get rid of all the pesky humans. That led me into the fourth type of post-apocalyptic setting, which is ecological upset. Oddly, for this one, I came up with the most subgroups, there's global warming, there's ice age, or global freezing, there's an astronomical collision like a meteor, or I don't know, the moon falls into the Earth, there were general disasters like flood, earthquakes, volcanoes, there was micro biological blooms.

This can happen on land, but I've also heard this can happen in the ocean, where you have huge algal blooms, and it destroys all the life in the ocean, but it also destroys a lot of the plankton, and then you get less oxygen, and all kinds of bad things happen. Of course, famine, which could have been the microbiological, biological terrorist thing going after food plants instead of people, but famine can happen for all kinds of reasons. Famine, and then maybe the solar, maybe the sun wanes, so it's not giving off enough radiation to support plant life, or it gets colder, or it gets hotter, or it gives off deadly radiation. So you can see, these kind of all go into other different categories.

I threw in supernatural causes just because I wanted to be complete. Um, I do think you kind of should keep these separate, you probably shouldn't have a post-apocalyptics and have all of these, but supernatural ones could be demonic interference, you could do what I call last days, which you could call revelation or rapture or whatever religious significance you want to put on that. Uh, there could be a dimensional shift, so now things are coming in from another dimension, but they're really scary and demonic and supernatural seeming. There could also just suddenly be magics in the world again, nobody knows why, but boom, the sudden influx of magic may just devastate our planet.

Evolution, so the sixth one is I put under just called evolution. Maybe some monstrous new creatures arise, you know, Godzilla comes out of the ocean, that may be related to radiation, it may not. We might have the next evolutionary step of homo sapiens, which means smarter people, maybe psychic people, who knows what the next evolutionary step would be, but they probably don't need or want us around anymore. You could do computer AI, see, that just factors into previous ones I've said. You could also have a form of transcendence, uh, which is explored in a lot of sci-fi novels, where basically humans go to the next step, not biologically, but like mentally, maybe we all transform into energy, and maybe not everybody does that, so it leaves some people behind.

And then the last one was just various alien scenarios, some of which we were talking about, uh, back in the original brainstorm for Fallout. You know, alien invasion, or they come into enslave people, or they're here to abduct people, or they're here to steal a lot of our resources, kind of like the V mini-series, where they're here for our water, but it turns out they're actually here to eat us as food. Um, there's also the War Against the Chtorr than a novels by David Gerrold, which talk about they're basically just being a microbiological diaspora in the galaxy, and wherever those tiny biological organisms land, they then kickstart an entire alien ecology. On Earth, there's a million ways to do this.

So I think those, those are the seven ways: War, radiation, plague, ecological upset, supernatural causes, evolution, or aliens. So that's kind of my oh, mini brainstorming, home journaling, just, I grabbed a bag of settings from my my current and old notes and just thought I'd share them just to show I still think of these things. I think you guys should think of them too if you want to make games, and for everybody who thinks my semi-retirement is boring, you're wrong.

Shorter Times And Smaller Budgets.md

https://youtu.be/APHKu89av6U?si=dQtaTkYLNM3BbFbk

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim, and today I want to talk about what to do when time and budget are tight. In fact, this is an answer to Abraham Drinken 2534 who asks or says, "I would like to see you talk about the hierarchy of needs within development and what are some of the first things to go when time and budget get tight."

Well, before I say that, let me remind you that people often talk about a triangle in development with three sides: good, fast, and cheap, and you have to pick two. So if you pick fast and cheap, you're not going to get good. I don't know how much I believe in this situation because first of all, once you go cheap, I don't see you getting good or fast. I don't see how you get fast with cheap, but anyway.

I've been in this situation a few times. BST Taale Construction Set was done in 14 weeks. Rags to Riches was done on a shoestring budget, very tiny team. I think I was the only programmer, and the producer doubled as the designer in addition to the guy who made the board game, so it was a very tiny team. And then we got artwork done mostly by, I think, one or two internal 2D artists and then a bunch of external devs. And then Tempo of Elal Evil, I've talked about on here, that was done, the original budget was 18 months, and when they switched from version 3 D&D to version three and a half, they gave us an extra whopping two months. So that was a really fast, low-budget game.

So I've done this, and so I thought about my answer of what you have to sacrifice in order to make something that's with a small team or with a small amount of time and small budget. So the first thing I thought was a smaller team. A big chunk of your budget goes to your team. If you reduce team size, your budget gets smaller automatically. Not sure about time, but your budget will shrink.

If it's time you need to reduce and not budget, then think about using external development, you know, hiring some contract artists or contract programmers. That doesn't always seem to work though. In my experience with it, you often, more frequently, ask for redos on the art because it doesn't quite match the style, or you have to ask for additional time from the coders to optimize their code, or you have someone who's not external who gets their code have to optimize it in-house, so you spend time there. Also, if you have enough external developers, you usually need to have a producer who just handles them, which then adds to your budget. But in many cases, external development can help.

In modern times, in addition to shrinking your team, you can also shrink your marketing. Marketing budgets have gotten much bigger. I've worked on games where the marketing budget was bigger than the production budget, and you may be shocked by that, but the reason for this is there are so many games out there. A huge problem with a modern game is just discoverability. You could make the best, coolest, funnest game ever and throw it up on Steam, and no one would ever find it. So you have to do some kind of marketing, even if it's viral, even if it's convincing or paying some influencers to play your game. You need some kind of marketing, but that's something you could cut if your budget needed to be shrunk, and then you'd either have to find creative ways to have your game be discovered or just cross your fingers and hope it's so good it becomes discovered.

Another thing you can do is reduce your content, and yes, that means make a shorter game. Just, you know, cut out levels, cut out areas of your game. This will make your game have, you know, be playable faster, but like I've said to teams I've worked with, if the biggest complaint people have about your game is they want more of your game, well, if you have to pick one complaint to have, that's the one I want to have. Gee, I wish there was more of this.

So if you make a shorter game, you have fewer areas which is less level design work, which is a lot of time. You can have fewer NPCs with all the things that are associated with NPCs: inventories, balancing, voiceover, dialogue, just everything. You can also get away with less art. If you have fewer areas, then in the areas you do have, you can have cohesive art like reusing trees and shrubs and ground, and just basically art makes sense because you're trying to make an area that looks like it's cohesive. If you have a lot of areas though that just look like the first area, people will notice that. So you can get, if you reduce the content in your game, you can get away with less art.

Another way to save on time and money is to reduce the complexity of your game, which basically means what you think it means. Make a simpler game. Give the player fewer options. There's fewer character builds, there's fewer armor, weapons. There's less choices they can make in the game, so you don't have to spend more time on those different paths. Like I mentioned with weapons and armor, make a lot less art variation, not just for the player but an enemy type. Reuse them. Humans are the best because you can usually give them an animation of shooting a weapon and then put different weapons in their hand, and you can get your variation that way.

One thing that often gets overlooked is, go through your user interface and minimize it. UI has, in my experience, been one of the largest time sinks in a game and one of the largest time sinks that's never ever planned for. UI just seems to always take longer than anybody plans, and it's usually redone over and over again as you're trying to home in on that UI that conveys the information in a way that makes sense but isn't cluttered and is easy to use. And it's just hard to make a good UI. So sometimes you just skew towards, let's have less UI. Let's convey things maybe a sound effect is enough. I don't need an icon. I don't need a popup, and you move on from that.

You can also try shifting to a simpler genre. RPGs, and I've maintained this, and it's not a well, it's what I make, so it's more complicated, but RPGs tend to have everything in it. There's exploration, there's dialogue, there's combat. You can always lean in and make an easier game that doesn't one of those. Adventure games often don't have combat. FPS games often don't have dialogue. So not only does that make the game simpler in the sense of there's content you don't need to make again, that's team members you don't need to have. I don't need a narrative designer if all I'm running around is shooting zombies in the world. Or you don't need a team of narrative designers. You may still want a narrative designer on hand to do end slides and lore text and stuff like that. I'm just saying if you simplify one aspect of your game, maybe you don't need all of that, and you can just make it simpler.

Kind of tangential

 to complexity is richness. You can make a less rich game, which I see is a little different than less complex. I'll give you some examples. You could do less voiceover or no voiceover at all. It's not necessarily making the game less complex, but it is less rich. It is less immersive. There's a lot of rendering features that I feel like could be pulled back on, and the game would be simpler and less rich, but you'd save a lot of time. Lighting tends to take a lot of time. Rendering features like reflection, I see people complain like they go into a modern game and they look at a mirror and they don't see a reflection. Yeah, but guess what? I've never seen anybody say, "This game is perfect on every feature except it doesn't have reflection. I'm not going to buy it." Never seen anybody say that. So cutting out things like that will save time. It also saves on bugs, and it usually helps your frame rate. So reducing that kind of richness helps you in ways you might not have anticipated.

Another way you can make your game less rich is don't go 3D, go 2D. I know this is a matter of contention. Some people think 2D games can take just as long as 3D games, and I agree, but in general, 2D games are faster to do than 3D games. You either need less art, or the art you do need is faster to create. So consider replacing, doing your game as a 2D game instead of a 3D game, or replace some things in your game that are 3D with 2D. Maybe you can replace all the cinematics with a 2D picture. We did that in Pillars. Some of our opening cinematics were just drawn with text over top, and that's another thing. Text can sometimes replace show. So you want something to have happened in the game, just have a text slider go by like the beginning of Star Wars saying, "This is what happened." You don't have to have a cinematic that shows it, or you don't have to have an in-game cinematic. You could just have it fade to black and say, you know, "You know, this bomb went off," or "This person escaped," and then let the person imagine it. Sometimes the thing it's replacing is something that would have taken you months to do. So consider doing that.

Actually, though, when it comes to cinematics though, and I want to be clear here, cinematics can go either way. You can lose them and replace them with a slide that has some text on it, and you can save a lot of time, but you can also use them to replace something that would take a lot more time, like if you need an entire area for the player to play through, so they get through a story plot point. Sometimes it'd be a lot faster, especially if there aren't any variations in that story plot point. The player is always going to go here and is always going to discover, say, this dead body. You could replace that with a cinematic of just having the player walk into some area and say, "Oh, it was hard getting here. Oh, there's the dead body. Oh, they killed her." Blah. That would be something you could do, and then you, if the cinematic, by having a cinematic, you can avoid a lot more, more expensive things. Go with, do that. Sometimes though, the cinematic itself can be replaced with something even simpler.

But ultimately, the best guide to how you will save time and budget is for you to understand what you're trying to make and also what your strengths are. What do you bring to the table? What are you trying to do, and how can you lean into the stuff you're good at? Let's say you're a good narrative designer or you have a really good narrative designer on the team. Why not make an adventure game or something that's come out recently, or combat-free RPGs? It simplifies the system mechanics of the game immensely, and a lot of things that would happen in combat are replaced with people talking, which is, you have somebody to write all that, and that's your strength. So if you've already got somebody who can do it and especially if they're really good at it and can do it quickly, replace, just get rid of it. Don't have combat in your game. Replace it with narrative.

You can see the flip happening. Let's say you've got a system designer who loves combat and gun mechanics. Well, maybe you should get rid of dialogue. Make a combat game. Make a dialogue-free combat game. There are a lot of, you can also replace big areas of your game with this. There are a lot of games that are full-on RPGs, but when they go into the dungeon or they go on the quest themselves, there's not a lot of talking. It's mostly creeping around and killing undead or, you know, killing bad guys, or a bandit who may just, you know, "I'm going to get you," but you don't actually enter into a complex dialogue with them. Lean into your strength. Decide what it is you can do well and quickly, and then do more of that and less of the things that you really don't have the resources to make.

So, wow, I talked longer than I thought. That is my answer, Abraham Drinken, to what you can do when your time and budget are tight. Of course, the best thing to do is to get more time and more budget, but that always isn't the answer, is it? So, I hope this helps.

Skill Design in RPGs.md
Youtube Link:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL_aTjKsxok

Hi everyone, it's me Tim, and today I want to talk about skill design in RPGs. In particular, queen of bad jokes 9413 asks:

"I wondered how you would approach skills for a new game. How do you choose what skill types are there, how do you and would you level them, is there a particular skill that has worked out for multiple games, how can you design for balancing, and are there skill tables too? I mean, testing besides in the testing rooms and player testing in the alpha."

Queen, that's a lot of questions. I will try to get at it. I made myself an outline so I wouldn't forget things, but this may be long.

First of all, I know I've said before that I always do the setting and then the story and then the mechanics. So the setting and Story come first, and the reason for this is when you're doing mechanics, and particularly skills, those are in support of whatever setting and story you've made. So your skills aren't just "hey, here are some things I thought would be cool to be able to do in a game", but "here are skills that would make sense for this setting and support this story I'm trying to tell".

So just like I like defining different paths you can get in Quests, for example, combat, stealth, and dialogue is what I did in Fallout, and then I added leadership Solutions in the Outer Worlds. This led to skills to support those things, which meant I had to have combat skills, I had to have stealth skills, I had to have dialogue skills, I had to have leadership skills. These weren't the skills weren't created, and then we thought "gee, what are we going to do with these?" It was, we had already decided we wanted that kind of gameplay, and there were parts of the story that would be involved with those paths through playing through the story. Therefore, we needed to support those in skills.

So now, of course, there's a lot of other things that you can do in an RPG: exploration, shopping, crafting. Those need support too. Now, not everything comes from quests or comes from skills, and you have to address that, but let me just make sure I cover the things I wanted to make sure.

If you were making exploring a haunted house where it's all these incorporeal ghosts or whatever, you probably wouldn't need combat skills. You'd probably want perception skills and dialogue skills, and maybe psychic skills. If you think you need a traps skill, how common are traps in your game? If you're not going to put in a lot of traps, why do you need a trap skill? Similarly, if you're not going to put in a lot of people to talk to, why do you need dialogue skills? If you're not going to do a lot of combat, you won't need combat skills. I've seen games that include speech skills and then barely make use of them, so it makes me go, "why did you do this?"

Now, one thing you're probably thinking is, "okay, you're putting in all these skills, when do I make it a skill versus making it a perk, or a trait, or a background, or any of the other myriad of character creation elements you've seen in my games?" Well, I view skills as something that improves overplay. You use these skills, you get better at these skills. The other ones, perks, traits, and backgrounds, many of these are either preconditions, things you were born with, you did not learn them, just the way you are, or if they are things that you can improve, it's not clear what's exactly improving it. And even if it is, they just have a few levels. I call perks like some perks are just really chunky skills. They skills that only really have three levels or five levels, and yes, you're improving them, but they're doing it in a very coarse way.

Now that brings me to the thing I really wanted to talk about: skill ranges. I think this is one of the most important discussions you can have when you're thinking about putting skills in your game. Exactly what are the ranges skills start at? Let's assume they all start at zero. Do they go up to 5, 10, 20, 100, more than that? My hands over here. Let's talk about each one of those and the pros and cons of doing it that way.

Let's say you wanted skills to go from 0 to 5. Well, these skills should probably only be increased when the player character levels up, and even then, you probably only give one point because spending a point in a skill range that only goes from 0 to five is a big increase. You're going from 1 to 2 to 3. That's a 20% increase at each jump. In fact, I would consider if you're really thinking about doing skills with this small of a level range, consider just doing perks instead and not having skills. I think we all know a game that did that.

Another thing you really have to think about is with skills going in a range of 0 to 5, it's really hard to create bonuses for those skills. So, look, you have a pickpocket skill that only goes from 0 to 5, and you make these silken gloves of pickpocketing. What's the bonus on them? And if they're plus two, that's almost half the range of that entire skill. Why put points in it if you can just find those gloves? So you have to really think about what will affect the skills before you can even think about what the range is you want on those skills.

So let's increase it to 0 to 10. Let's say skills go from 0 to 10. Again, I would probably limit skill increases to leveling, but instead of one point every time the player levels, maybe consider giving two. Maybe put a restriction saying you get two points, but you have to spend them in different skills. Again, these are a little hard to make bonuses for because let's say you have a skill for picking a lock, and you want to make you know glasses of lockpicking, you know, magnet finding glasses that make it easy to lockpick. Again, you put a plus two bonus on that thing, you've just done an entire player level's worth, or two levels worth of bonus for glasses. It's crazy. So I would even consider at that range again not doing bonuses from items.

Let's talk about 0 to 20 as a range. Now we're talking. This is where I'm more comfortable with skills having ranges from 0 to 20. Yes, you can increase them from leveling, but occasionally I'd put in bonuses from other sources, from items, maybe spell buffs, maybe drug buffs, but I would limit those bonuses to plus one or plus two. Even on a range of of 20, I'd still limit them to a plus one or plus two bonus, and I'd probably say they don't stack. So once you're getting a bonus to your skill from any source, no other source will give you a bonus unless it's bigger, and then that source is the bonus and the other one isn't. So there's no stacking of bonuses in there.

Let's talk about the final range, 0 to 100. So if you want to do skills from 0 to 100, okay, now we're talking. Now you can give lots of points when the player levels up. He can spread them among different skills. You can have bonuses come from different sources. You could have armor that gives bonuses, you can have spells that give bonuses, you can have drugs that give bonuses, and I'd probably put some sort of stacking rules in, so maybe the three highest sources of bonus add into it. Or maybe each type of bonus can stack, so you can have the highest bonus you're getting from your armor adds to the highest bonus you're getting from a spell adds to the highest bonus you're getting from a drug. So the highest of those three sources, they all add together. So now you can have three different bonuses increase your skill. I think this is a really cool way of doing it.

And because of that, in my games, I've always leaned towards 0 to 10, 0 to 20, or 0 to 100 as my skill range. Then finally, you asked about how to balance it and use them in the game. And I know you're probably thinking about when I talked about loot tables and how to drop items. What we tended to do in all the RPGs was come up with some estimate for every map, either based on the level of creatures in the map or the expectation of what the player level would be in the map, or what story act that map is primarily involved in, so how far along the player is in the story. And the skill ranks are based on that. A very good example of this is determining what ranks to check in dialogues for speech skills. We would often make those tests against higher and higher speech skill ranks as you went farther and farther into the game, either into tougher maps or maps that occurred later in the game, in later parts of the story.

Now you can hardcode those, but another really clever thing to do is to define ranges and say, "this is an easy speech check, this is a hard speech check, this is a really hard speech check, and this is a near impossible speech check." And then those reference in a table what actual ranks you mean. So if your ranks went from 0 to 20, an easy one might be 3, a hard one might be 12, a very hard one might be 16, and a near impossible one might be 19. So for 0 to 20, those are the ones you could use, and then everybody just checks against "this is a hard check," "this is a near impossible check."

After the game is put together, you can go through there and decide, "this hard check should probably be an easy check," or "I think all hard checks should go from 12 to 13," either because you think it's too easy to get 12, or it should just be a little bit harder, or it has something to do with how many points you're giving per PC level, and you don't want the player to be able to pass a hard check until they're this level for whatever reason. If you abstract the skill ranks you check against, it's easy to adjust them later.

And then you can do this for a lot of things. You can make put ranked difficulties on locks, on computers that have to be hacked, on um, when you pickpocket someone, it can be based on their level. So the level you make an NPC is how hard it is to pickpocket from them, among other things. So you have all these things you can adjust if you want to make the game harder without necessarily going back and adjusting anything about the skill itself.

So those are my thoughts on making skills, on what skills you need based on your story and your setting, what skill range you want to use, and whether you should, instead of skills, make it a perk or a background or a trait. And then finally, how you can actually balance getting all the skills in there. This is kind of the techniques I use. Works pretty good, I think.

So, queen of bad jokes, I hope that answered your question.

Social Conflict Resolution.md
Youtube Link:
https://youtu.be/AvEltSS8U1k?si=fc0OS42qfJsQZ4Uk

Hey everyone, it's me, Tim, and today I want to talk about social resolutions in RPGs, and by that, I mean combat resolutions that are social, not combat conflict resolutions that are social. It's hard to talk about. I'm going to answer a question from Stavos Nicola, who's asked several questions so far on this channel. He keeps asking good questions, so I'm going to keep answering them. He asks how do you feel about social, peaceful resolutions in RPGs. Many RPGs tend to use social persuasion-based resolutions for quests or challenges as a one-roll skip combat choice. Rarely, games employ mini-games or other forms of social combat that make these social encounters more interesting or even on par with the physical combat resolutions. Do you feel RPGs today sufficiently support the social pillar with engaging gameplay, and if not, how would you have liked it to be handled?

So, I think it's pretty obvious that my answer is going to be that I like peaceful social resolutions to conflict. They've been part of every RPG I've made for the last 25 years. Fallout had one of the most famous ones where you can have that encounter with the Master, and you can convince him that his grand plan is going to fail because all of the mutants are sterile. Now, you just can't walk in there and say, "Here, they're sterile, you know, speech roll 75, I did it." But you have to have evidence, and I'll talk about that.

But I think you're right in that a lot of games do support this one-roll skip everything. It doesn't make any sense for you to walk up to a big bad guy, a boss perhaps, the end game boss, and they give you a big monologue how they've done all this evil stuff and they're going to do more, and there's no way you can stop them, and they're about to do this horrible thing, and you can just go, "Speech 100, don't," and they stop. I think that's dumb. I don't like it, and I wish developers wouldn't do that and then claim they have a social playthrough in their game.

So, but I want to balance that. I don't really like verbal combat either. I know what you're talking about, where there are like either a mini-game that you can play. I played a game with a mini-game; it was a circle, I don't remember, I want to say Bethesda made it, and it was, it spun around, and you did things. I didn't like that one either. Basically, the problem with it is not only does it feel really aggressive, so it doesn't feel like you're playing a peaceful talker guy, but usually, it doesn't feel like real dialogue at all. It usually, the associated text is weird, it just doesn't sound right, it doesn't make any sense to me, and my narrative bar is low.

So, what I always thought you needed to do in games that support dialogue-based solutions to quests is the dialogue's there, but you need to support it with evidence, and I'll talk about what I think evidence is. But I also think it's important that when you do this solution that you're told in advance that you need to find out something to use. They either tell you what they are, what the evidence is, and then you need to go find it, or they just tell you that evidence exists, and then you need to go find out what that evidence is, and you know, come back with it. It may even be the case, and I would love it if a game just, when you got to a player line, it could say the line's grayed out, and in brackets, it said like "speech 75, comma evidence," so you know you need some kind of evidence, and you know your speech has to be at least 75, so you can come back if it's important, and then there's some way out of that, you're like, "I'll meet you again, you know, dark lord," and then you leave and you come back.

What I like about that solution is you can go collect it physically. Oh, by the way, you don't have to do that, you could have some other person say, "Hey, I wouldn't go there unless you're really good at talking and you have this evidence." But either way, so then you go collect that evidence in the world. Now, I think some of it is you have to literally go find records somewhere, you know, you have to, there's stuff you can collect that proves that you're right. This is kind of what we did in Fallout with the Master.

Now, to get those records, maybe you need to use your dialogue skills, maybe you need to persuade someone of something, maybe you need to lie to get past a guard to get into a record room, maybe you need some stealth skills, maybe you need to pick a lock or hack a computer or something. That's all fine, as long as the main skills involved are speech skills. I don't mind if there's like a low-value lock that has to be picked or, you know, a simple computer that has to be hacked. I think that's cool to put up a little bit of those barriers, but the main thing should be speech.

Another way of collecting the evidence is simply you get it from other people that you have to talk to a lot of people and put this stuff together. So again, that would be going into dialogue trees with NPCs, maybe it's scientists who have information, maybe it's friends of the bad guy, maybe it's relatives, maybe it's archaeologists who have records about this has happened before, and these are what the records say. But it requires you to talk to them and make speech checks in that. That's why I like having more than one speech skill. I love the persuasion, lie, and intimidate in Outer Worlds because it made it feel like well, some people you might have to intimidate, and other people you might have to just bold-faced lie to, and other people you can persuade, "Hey, why don't you just tell me it? Why don't you be cool? I thought you were cool."

What I like about that is that's a pure speech solution. The evidence is out there in pieces that a bunch of different people know. You learn it all, you put something together, and then you go back to the bad guy, and you're like, "You're not the Dark Lord. You're Dark Lord Junior, and your dad hates you," or whatever you want to put together. So, I feel like that's a fun thing because no one NPC knew the whole story about Dark Lord, but you put it all together, and you go back and let him have it.

Another way you could do it is maybe you're the one who creates the evidence. Maybe you run experiments, maybe some of those experiments use science skills at a low level, or you, you know, and you discover things about the bad guy, or maybe you're literally testing things in the world. Maybe you discover a lab, and you can start it up, and maybe doing certain experiments give certain values, and you're like, "Oh my goodness, the electron volts here are way lower than he said it would be," or "This device changes the grav

imetric constant in this area," something. And you, you basically gather all this data yourself, and then you go back to the bad guy, and you go, "Guess what, your device doesn't do what it said it did, or your device won't work, and I can prove it," because you actually did those experiments.

Now, whether you collect that data or talk to other people to get it, or you create that information yourself, I think that all that stuff should be balanced so that that evidence gathering part takes about as much time as the combat path or stealth path would take, and it should be just as fun. It should be, it should feel like a cool part of the game and not something that's tacked on. But what you have to do is you have to think if a player made a dialogue-based character, he's going to like doing this stuff. So if you create a bunch of these things that could be done, then I think you could make as much fun stuff for a dialogue-based character to do, the same way you come up with combat encounters or vents or, you know, locked doors or alternate paths through areas that you do for the stealth person, you can come up with these solutions for the dialogue character.

And then they can have fun with this alternative way of dealing with the bad guy. And because it's not as simple as a simple roll, you avoid any of the issues where maybe someone just doesn't have a high speech skill but pops some kind of drug that makes it artificially high, and then they just go through that. You also make it so this is something the person has to deliberately do. They just don't get to the end and do it. "Oh, it just came up in dialogue." No, unless you tried to do this thing, you tried to collect all this evidence, you're not going to accidentally do it at the end.

I think if you combine all these things together, I think you get a really interesting way of making dialogue solutions for role-playing games that feel as rich and rewarding as a combat solution or a stealth solution. And I don't think it's much more work, and I don't think it takes much more time, and I don't think it would add to dev costs significantly. It does add because it is an extra path you're working on, but I don't think the examples I gave here require that much extra work.

So anyway, I hope that answers your other what is this, your third good question, Stavos? Anyway, keep those questions coming, and I hope this answered it.

Speedrunning.md

https://youtu.be/l-Vuw-qWCgY?si=4tf-dbb0BqkQrwHN

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim. Today I'm going to ask and answer another question from Tommy salami6694 who asks, "Hey Tim, I was wondering if speedrunning has any effect on the games you've made, specifically the scope of bug fixes post-launch, and internal developer views on speedrunning."

I think speedrunning is an interesting topic to talk about. I know there was a video made of Leonard and I watching speed running in Outer Worlds, and I'll talk about that, but I'll just start by saying I love speedrunning. I think it's a really clever way of playing the game. So do most of my colleagues, so as far as I can tell, most people I know like speed running, and we kind of see it as an ingenious way of playing the game. I will say it's probably not a good way to enjoy the game. When you speedrun, you just run past encounters, you ignore quests and story. It's not really enjoying the game; it's an enjoyable way to challenge yourself in the game. It's kind of like when you're trying to get achievements. Sometimes the thing you have to do may not be enjoyable; it's like, "Oh, I gotta kill all these things," or "I've gotta... what was that one in WoW where you had to jump find that highest thing you could jump off of and still not die?" And by the way, I'm not saying that's a good achievement, and remembering that.

So, what I realized though, is that every speedrunner I was watching had played the game tons of times in order to be able to get to the stage where they could speed run through the game. So I think the first time I experienced speed running with any of the games I've made was with Fallout. When we shipped Fallout, we estimated it was going to take people 40 to 60 hours to play through the game because there was a lot of things to explore and there's a lot of storyline. However, some people in QA had gotten through the main storyline in a little under eight hours, which was really cool because that meant we could give them a new build every day and they could play through the whole main story arc again. When we shipped the game, after someone was talking about a speedrun, and I'm not even sure there were videos up of it, they just described what they did. Somebody did it in two hours, which I was really impressed with. Two hours is, you know, a quarter of the time it took the QA people to get through it. But then somebody did it in something like 15 minutes, and we were all like, "What?" And then somebody did it in eight minutes, and I was like, "Okay, now I had to look at what they did." And it turns out the 15-minute run was getting the water chip and then killing both the mutants and the master by blowing up those bases. The eight-minute one, he never even went and got the water chip. Turns out we never checked to see if you had the water chip. We just assumed you got it and figured, "Okay, good for you, um, yeah, hey now, now go to the military base." He just skipped that part. He just went straight to the military base, killed them, then went over to the cathedral, went down the basement, set the bomb, and blew up the master. And I'm like, "This is clever, and this is smart." So much of the game you miss out on though, it's like I felt bad for all the fun that they missed out on, but I realized the speedrun itself was the fun.

So in Outer Worlds, there's even the video, I checked, it was still up, IGN did a video of Leonard and I watching a speedrun. We were both equally amazed at the clever ways that that person employed to do it really quickly, plus it was just fun to watch it with Leonard. I mean, if you know, he and I get along really well, we had fun watching this guy short circuit quests, figure out ways of getting in places, the clever things he did to like jump out of an instance and then right back into it just to clear the flag that combat was running so he could then use some piece of equipment. It was just clever, and I think he did it in like, what was it, was it 12 minutes? It was pretty crazy.

I know people think that, well, that must aggravate you as a designer because somebody's skipping all your stuff. It would be weird; it'd be like making a really fancy meal and then having someone say, "I want to see how fast I can eat this." Okay, I get what you're doing, but there's this really nice meal here; it's been a lot of time on it. So, besides that, as a designer, you often block content in the game for a couple of reasons. You may want to keep low-level players from stumbling into just crazy overpowered zones where they're going to be killed immediately, or you want a storyline to unfold, and yes, even non-linear storylines need certain pacing so that's why you tend to set things out like, "Okay, you need a key to get in here," and "Until this person tells you about this quest, this place isn't open." We tend to do that, but I will admit, on my games, we don't do it as often because we do have that go anywhere you want, do whatever you want mentality.

So, I for one have never added a feature just to mess with speedrunning. I don't think that that's something that should be on me. If people want to figure out how to bypass content, knock yourself out. But similarly, we usually don't fix bugs based on speedrunning because the speedrunning is fine. I'm not gonna, you know, take out some barrels because they let you jump over a fence. I'm not going to make a door unlockable until you've talked to a quest giver. But if speedrun shows that the game can get into a bad game state where there's a chance the main storyline can't be finished, you can bet I'm gonna fix that bug. That's one of the things I talked about, is no matter what kind of character you make and no matter how you play and what order, the main story arc has to be completable. So if I see a speedrun reveal something that, even though of course it doesn't have the speedrunner because they're trying to finish the game, but if they reveal something that they're doing that could lead to a bad game state, yeah, I'll go in and fix that.

I've also seen some comments, even on my channel, saying we should hire speedrunners for testing. Maybe. There's a lot more to testing than just seeing how fast you can get through the game. I don't and also that's something I don't necessarily want to prevent, so it's not a... what I love getting out of QA is, "I made this character, and this area was way too hard or couldn't be done," or "If you do these quests out of order, it caused a bug," or "If I do this and then this, it crashes." Those are just, you know, what the game... to do that speedrunning, I don't want to prevent.

 So hiring a speedrunner for QA, I can think of a dozen other attributes I'd rather have in a creative person than can speedrun. I'm not saying I wouldn't hire someone if they're a speedrunner, I'm just saying I don't look for that.

So, kind of to sum up, let me just say I love speedrunning. I think it's incredibly creative. One thing that it does for me personally, it kind of reminds me of my early high school D&D players, and I know I've talked about this in other videos, but those people never ever did anything I expected, and that was part of the fun. I realized that was part of the charm of the game, and giving players that much agency to choose to do wildly different things, and as the GM having to figure out how to handle that was part of the fun of D&D for me in high school. And the fact that I moved that into my games meant that I not only expect but I want players to have this kind of agency, and speedrunning is just an exercise of that form of player agency where you're like, "I don't want to do this; I want to do this. I don't want to go here; I want to go here." And the fact that the game opens up and allows it and lets you finish early, I don't necessarily want to stop that. I like it.

Like I said, I don't think it's the best way to experience the game. I don't think it's the most enjoyable way to experience the game, but if you want to do that, knock yourself out. I'm never going to go back; I've never gonna watch a speedrun and then go back and patch the game to prevent a speedrun. I think patches post-release should be basically to fix crashes, really egregious bugs, and maybe some more balanced issues, but certainly not to make the game less playable in certain ways. So that's my thoughts on speedrunning. I like it. Knock yourselves out, speedrunners, knock yourself out in my games.

Stop Making Excuses.md

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim, and it's tough love today on the Canon Games Channel because I want all of you to stop making excuses and start making games. Consider this my "Shia LaBeouf Just Do It" motivational speech video. But I've told you guys, I read the comments, and I'm reading comments with so many different reasons that people are rationalizing why they're not working on a game. So let's walk through some of those, and then at the end, I'll give you some ideas for games you can make that will help you get started because they're compartmentalized nicely.

Anyway, here's some of the reasons I see people saying they're not making games:

- They don't have any time. This is the number one reason people love to give for everything. It's the procrastinator's Blue Plate special of excuses. You do have time. You're watching this video right now. If you stop watching my videos, they'll be there in a few months, waiting for you to come back to them. But if you spent 15 minutes a day just working on something, you're start to get results. I know that doesn't sound like you can with such a short period of time, but I'm going to talk about a couple projects you can do that you can literally work on them in little increments every day.

- Some of you go, "I don't have any money. I can't get started." Wow, this maybe was true 40 years ago when you had to make everything from scratch, but the fact that GDau and Unreal and Unity and Game Salad and all these other engines are completely free for you to play with, there's no excuse. You have you certainly probably, well I shouldn't say certainly, but you almost certainly have a device in your house that can run those and just that you play with making things. The bare most bare bones PC or Mac or Linux box can run these things. So the bar to entry has never ever been smaller.

- I see a really common excuse as well, "I can't do it all." You don't have to. You literally don't have to anymore. There is so much stuff out there that is free, and I'll show you. When I was making one of my little toy games, I can't do art, I can't do sound, but there's a lot of places where you can just download stuff, especially if you're just going to play with it. You don't need a license. You just, people offer it up. There's so many tutorials out there, and they offer like, here's a model, here's a piece of code to get you started, here's some sound effects. Just do it. Just grab these things and start putting stuff together. The amount of work you have to do has never been smaller.

So if you can't do this now, you need to look at everybody who's ever made a game before and go, "How did they do it?"

I know some of you are going, "Why should I do it? It's too hard to get in the business anyway. It's pointless." To all of which I can say is, I've talked about this so many times. If you have a demo, it will be easier for you to get into the business. It will at least get you more interviews. It'll get you people asking how you did some things, how you learned some things. Sometimes we hire people, um, I remember interviewing some people and just going, "Wow, they figured that out on their own. This is the kind of person I want on my game." So when we run into things that none of us can figure out, well, this person will try to figure it out on their own. They just won't go, "Well, I'm stuck. I'm done. I'm going to sit here and wait until somebody tells me what to do."

And then I've read another one that people talk about that sure, from my viewpoint, this stuff should be easy because I'm so entitled. To all I can say is, if, first of all, I don't think I'm nearly as well off or whatever as you think I am, but compare me, don't compare yourself to me now, compare yourself to me when I got started, when I was, you know, in high school. I just had to go to the library to figure out a lot of this stuff. There was no one to explain how the Atari worked to me. Even the teacher we had at school who was in charge of the computer labs didn't know how they worked. All he could do is point me to books and give me some of the tech manuals that came with the computer and said, "Figure it out." But, you know, also when I started, when I before I decided to get back into the business, when I went to Interplay, I was a student. I was tens of thousands of dollars in debt. It was a bit of a risk to jump in there. I could have gotten a better paying, safer job, but I didn't, and you can always do that. And if it doesn't work out, at least you tried. You're not going to re, you at least you can look back and say, "I don't regret not trying it because at least I tried it."

So all I can tell you is you can't compare yourself to that. I mean, I did that nu-car break, uh, acting, if you can call it that. I wasn't comparing myself to the other actors who were in that. I mean, they were amazing. I wasn't sitting there going, "Yeah, I shouldn't do this because these people are amazing." It was like, "I get to stand next to these people and not look stupid for a few minutes." It'd be like me comparing myself to, you know, I don't know. I don't really follow actors. Who's considered a good actor? I don't know. But it's dumb. I mean, it'd be like me saying, "I want to direct a movie, but that Steven Spielberg, he's so entitled. He gets all the best projects." I mean, that just doesn't make any sense.

So let's talk about what you can do to get started. I showed a video months ago when I was up in the middle of the night with insomnia on a little space combat game I made. Let's just bring that up. This is a great game for you to try to make yourself because it will teach you a lot of the basics. I did it in Unity. So let's just walk through what this will teach you about Unity. First of all, you have to set up a project. You learn how to do that. It, I mean, it doesn't sound like a big deal, but there are some things involved with when you first set up a project in Unity, and you have to decide, is it going to be a 2D, 3D, what's it going to be named, where am I going to keep it, what models am I going to use? Like I said, there's free stuff online. I grabbed a free starship model. I grabbed some Skyboxes that people offered for free just so I could get started. So the very first thing I learned how to do, or relearned because

 I already kind of knew it but I hadn't touched Unity in years when I did that, was just how to do player movement, you know, how to translate events coming in from the keyboard and the mouse into moving the ship around. That right there is a big chunk of what you're gonna have to do in every game. And there's decisions to be made, like, do I want inertia? When I stop pushing forward, do I want the ship to keep going forward? When I bank, do I want it to relevel after I stop banking? These are all decisions you're going to have to make and learn how to code. There is code out there that will do some of these basic things for you. Download it, look at it, play with it, modify it. Learning how to put up a Skybox is something right there. Grab a Skybox online, figure out where you have to put it in Unity, what it looks like, how you're supposed to um, move the player around in the Skybox. You will quickly notice that because the Skybox is infinite distance away, you will never, you can tell when you go up and down and bank, but you can't really tell if you're going forward or back. So that's when I added stars to the scene. And the stars, right there, I had to learn how to do that. I was like, "I'm going to have to put these little spheres. Oh, shoot, now I've got to put some ambient lighting in the scene because I can't really see them well. And now I'm going to have to decide how far away they get before, or I destruct them, or move them. I don't want a lot of destruction and recreation going on. Move them to a new location out in front of me so it always looks like there's stars coming, so I don't go by a bunch of stars and now they're all behind me." These are all things you have to learn while you're doing it. Then you can start putting other ships. You already have a starship model; it's the one you're using on your player. Throw some of them out there. Now you will learn how to do, how to make them move around, which will teach you some basic AI. Everything in Unity is driven by that update function. You can just keep a state on there and have a player, whenever it gets called update, moves itself a little bit. You can put in firing photons. That will teach you again how to move objects in the world, but it'll also teach you how to do collision and how to track damage on uh, your ship and the enemy ships, and when to mark an enemy ship as destroyed, and what to do, like to replace its model with an explosion. Oh, now you're learning particle effects. So this was a really good way of learning all those things in one collapsed little thing.

But then it was reminded me, and I wish I could show it 'cause I, I know I said I keep everything. I can't find this. When I was teaching myself C, I already knew C and C++, but I wanted to learn C#. This is like in the early 2000s. Um, I put together an image filtering program, and this was just something that you could load in pictures and do things to them, making black and white, um, run a bunch of things called convolution matrices, which I'll talk about in a second. But just this simple image filter program taught me so much about how to do things in C#. I had to learn how to work with the file system. I had to learn how to load and save files, especially files that were using jpeg format, so I had to learn that. By the way, C# makes that a lot easier than C. I had to learn how to make a UI in C#. I had to do filters on the actual images, and I did something called convolution matrix filters. These are basically, if you treat your image as a texture, there are lots of different convolution matrices, they're called kernels, I think, that when you apply them along rows and columns to the original image, you get a new image. This is how sharpen filters work, blur filters, embossing, edge detection, all of these are just different forms of what are called convolution matrix filters. Learn one, you now know them all. So it was a really cool thing to do.

Now, in all of this, I also learned how to use C#. I think I was doing it in Visual Studio, but I also learned two important lessons about C#. It was really fast to develop this image filter program because C# does a lot of the heavy lifting for you. It does a lot of loading and saving and some of the UI work for me, but the resulting program was really slow. For comparison, I wrote my own version in C++, I had to do a lot more work. It took me a few days to make the image program in C#. It probably took me a few weeks to make it in C++, but the C++ one did in a second what the C# one took 30 seconds or a minute. Like, applying one of those convolution matrix filters, literally, some of them took a minute to do in C# that ran in a second or less in C++. Something to learn right there, and that's something that you learn by doing. You can read it all you want, but then when you do it, you're like, "Oh my goodness, this is so..." So then I learned how to do some optimizations, and there was a limit to how much you can optimize in C# because it hides things from you. I know people want me to talk about it, but like, C++ is right above assembly, and then C# layers a bunch of stuff on top of that. I mean, C++ and then C# layers even more. So the farther away you get from writing the chip, the slower things get.

So either one of these, doing a starship little mini starship combat game or just writing an image filtering program, both of those will teach you so much about just how to put together a small little game or app. Try it. Do it. Just remember, I want you to make games. It's kind of the whole point of this channel. So stop making excuses and start making things.

Story Vs Game Design.md
Youtube Link:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LptJrOO2zSQ

Hi everyone, it's me Tim, and today I want to talk about Story versus game design, or as Sherner asks, what is more important for a game: story or game design? I know ideally there should be a balance between the two, but that is so rare to find. What's your view on it? Sorry, I got a tickle in my throat today, so let me say first of all, this is a good question, but maybe not for the reason you think. I'm going to say it's a good question. Let's take a look at it.

First of all, what do you mean by game design? Because story is part of game design. So, saying what's more important, story or game design? Well, story is part of game design. So, game design now, maybe what you meant by game design was system mechanics, the rules that get made by the designer for how the game is played. Maybe you meant setting, or maybe you meant the user experience (UX), or maybe you meant any of the number of other things that can fall under the umbrella of game design.

So, in one sense, it's a trick question because me asking you what you mean by game design is itself a trick question. Mine is a trick question because it doesn't really matter what you say. When you could tell me game design, you meant anything, and I'd have the same answer. Yours is a trick question because the answer of Story versus game design varies by game or even by genre.

So, I will break that down, and we're talk about that. First off, I have played games that have almost no story, and they're still super fun. That's pretty much every game made, you know, not all of them, but a lot of them made in the '80s and '90s. The story was such a thin veneer on the game that today it would be called a setting. Doom's story was demons are loose on a base, and you have to stop them. That's a setting. The story would be some scientist was doing an experiment, and the demons got out, and they're going to take over the Earth, and unless you can stop them before a certain amount of time or before something else happens, and there are characters you have to interact with, and there are acts to the story, and all that. Saying there are demons in a base, and you should go kill them all is more of a setting. However, for some people, that's a good enough story, especially for that kind of game. For Shooters and FPSs, it's pretty much okay to have very little story. You don't need a lot of story to prop those games up.

Conversely, though, I've played a lot of games that have very very little design, and by Design in this case, I mean system mechanics, past a storytelling experience. Although I've also played games that have very little in the way of interface, pretty much they consist of games you've all played these where you go from location to location, and then a story is exposited. You, your only Choice, your only agency is what Rooms To Go to in what order, and within the room what to click on, and that's pretty much all you can do is you interact with something, and then a little story is told, or you enter a room, and a story is told. So, there really isn't much to those games besides someone wanted to tell a story, and they decided to do it in a game format. Sometimes it's completely linear, often especially lately, people have gotten better at telling stories in a nonlinear fashion, so you yourself have to put together the pieces and figure out what the story order was.

But because these two extremes exist of games with very little story and games with very little mechanics, I hope that makes you understand that the question of what's better, story or game design, is actually a non-question. It's like the Buddhist question of does a dog have Buddha nature, and you're supposed to just go "Mew," you un-ask the question. The question itself is not, it's not even that it's not relevant, the question itself contains its own un-as, its own, it's no longer a logical question, like the "are you still beating your spouse?" question. I never have beaten my spouse, so "are you do you keep beating your spouse" is a very, it's a non-question.

So similarly, you might have said, "hey, what's better, graphics or setting?" Well, again, depending on the game, some games really better have a really good graphics, but when you think about the graphics part of what makes Graphics so good is a very thematic look to it, which is very dependent on the setting, so it's hard to tease these things apart, and I hope that's what you're hearing me say. Um, for most games, it's hard to tease they part one element from another. However, many games do rest most of their interesting features on one of those areas. You may have played a game that's really good, just beautiful, and that's why you played it. You may have played another game because it had really fun puzzles. You may play another game because it has really good combat. Maybe you played the game because it has a really good story, and maybe you play the game because it has really good mechanics. If you're lucky, you get a game that has all those, but not every game needs all those. Some need a lot more of one than the other. If you were playing a real-time shooter, if you're playing Counterstrike, do you really want to stop to get story elements while the other people are playing are running around possibly shooting at you? No. Similarly, if you're playing an adventure game, well, those aren't even really need combat. You just walk around, and you talk to people, and a story is told. There have been very popular games like that that have come out recently. So, some games need more of one of those things than others, most need all of them. So, to answer your question about what's more important for a game, story or game design, I would say some games need more of those than another, but most need both, just like any other element of the design.

So, Sherner, I hope this answers your question, and I hope this gives you an interesting way of looking at games going forward.

Storytelling in MMORPGs.md
Youtube Link:
https://youtu.be/MZB516hovas?si=5bSpTFqohzlRVFhR

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim. Today, I want to talk to you about storytelling in massively multiplayer online RPGs. I recently did a podcast; it was really good, should be up in August, and the interviewer, who was asking me all kinds of really good questions—I mean, I love when a journalist or anyone interviewing you asks you really evocative questions that make you think rather than what was your influence for this game, how did you design this area, what made you think of this feature. I mean, I get it, maybe you've been told to ask those questions, but I've answered those a billion times.

So, what he asked towards the end of the discussion, he said, "What got away from you? Because I know you're retiring, what do you think got away from you? What's the one thing you wish you had done?" And without even any hesitation, I was like, "I wish I had made an MMO because I was on WildStar, a lot of my ideas made it in there, but a lot of them didn't," and I kind of regret that I don't have an MMO under my belt because I loved them. I went through a period, like '98 to 2008, 2010, probably about 10 years where I was really into MMOs, played them a lot, played them probably more than single-player RPGs. That's a regret I have because there were a lot of good single-player RPGs that came out.

But in any case, in 2010, I gave a talk at GDC Online in Texas, and I gave a talk on storytelling in MMORPGs. Someone recently mentioned that that is not available online, and I'm like, "Oh, I thought there was a video of it." So what I'll do is I'll go over it here quickly because it was like a 40-minute talk, so I'll go through it faster. It was called "Storytelling in MMORPGs," and I start with the meat. I always like to start by saying what I'm gonna say, and then I say it, and then I say what I said.

**Types of Storytelling**

Basically, you can break down storytelling in MMORPGs into three kinds: you have the Zone stories, these are things that take place when you enter a Zone, you meet an NPC, you discover a new area, there are quests to do for that NPC or in that area, and you learn kind of like what this area is about. Oh, this is the dark wooded area with a necromancer layer, or this is a coastal area and they're having trouble with squid monsters. So you learn all that, you learn about a Zone and its inhabitants.

Then there's the Epic World story. This is things that happen near the end of the game, and this is where I want to put all of the really, uh, what you would consider not linear, but the storyline is primarily at the end of the game, and I'll talk more about that later, but that's where I want the Epic World story to be, at the end when you've hit level cap and you've been to all the zones.

And then finally, I want you to have a starting story. I think it's really important in MMOs to kind of introduce people to the world, and you can do that by having a starting zone for everyone, or you can do that by letting players pick backgrounds, and the story is kind of tailored for that particular player's background. You can guess which one of those I like. I like the latter.

So let's dive into this and talk about it. So yes, my background is single-player RPGs, and therefore, I know I'm kind of biased in what I'm saying here, but I think it works.

**Single Player**

In a single-player RPG, the huge advantage you have is that the world revolves around the player. The player's actions change things, and since it's the only player, you know, the changes to the world are because of the player, and NPCs can react. Now, some of them have very linear storylines; you've all played RPGs that are linear. Some of them have non-linear ones, and they adjust to the player, where the player is going, what level he is, and all that, and then the game's over, maybe you get some end slides, all that. It makes the player feel special, not in the sense that he's necessarily a chosen one or whatever, but that he made a story in this world.

**Forced Content**

The problem with MMOs is, how do you tell a big, Zone-spanning narrative when players are one of thousands of players literally on that server, and ones of tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, or even millions across all the servers? When they can skip what zones they want to go to because there may be multiple zones that are appropriate for your level, when they can outlevel content and then leave a Zone before they finished it, when they might have friends helping them at different levels, when MMORPG players hate forced content. And forced content is either a dungeon you have to do or a cinematic you have to watch; they tend to hate that. If you can't differentiate between a world story and his own story, how do you even tell a Zone's Banning story? So you have to be able to do that, and also, with MMOs, unlike a lot of RPGs, some RPGs let you keep playing, but MMOs are designed from the very beginning to keep you playing forever, and that has to kind of factor into what kind of story you're going to tell.

So I've seen a lot of failed approaches, excuse me, I've seen a lot of failed approaches at this. I've seen lore bombs where you go into a Zone, and either there's a cinematic or an event that happens that you're forced to watch, or a, excuse me, an NBC that comes up to you, forces conversation, and just drops lore, lore after lore on you. Movies that you can't avoid, I've seen linearity, you know, that's how they're forced, you know, "Oh, you can't skip this Zone. You will do this Zone. I don't care that you're out-leveled. I don't care that there are no items in it you want. I don't care that this is your third time playing the game. You will play that zone." I've seen it done with instances, and in the worst case, I'm not going to name it, the instances were solo, so there I was, playing with a friend, we went into a cave, and Bam, we were in two caves, each of us in our own cave; we couldn't see each other anymore. That one was awful; that one, I noped out of that game fairly quickly after that.

**Failed Approaches**

I see failed approaches by saying we won't have a story, we just have lots of little short stories, and the player can link them together in their head and into a narrative. And then finally, I've seen sandbox worlds where people just go, there's no story at all, nothing, just go in there, kill things, take their stuff; it's a sandbox.

The solution I recommended was take the giant Epic World-spanning story and

 shove it all to the end of the game. What's great about this is the player by then will know all these characters, or a lot of them, who've met a lot of them along the way, will know most if not all the locations, or at least have heard about the locations and kind of know what they're like, and the player is powerful, so you don't have to do any kind of level scaling. You kind of know the players are at or near level cap and has a lot of good items, so you can just plan for that in the story, and if they don't, it's okay for them to go, "Wow, this boss guy in the world story is really hard. I'm gonna have to go get a better item." They can do that.

So, it's not like saying I won't have any other stories. Like I mentioned, you start at the beginning of the game with a story. You make it very small, very understandable. You can make it act like a tutorial if you want, so the story leads people through crafting and level up and things like that. I would recommend personalizing this. Maybe the player picked a background, and based on that background, their story chain, the beginning story changes. Players love that. It also means when they replay, they get slightly different starting stories. It's fun.

**Mid-Level Approaches**

Then, in the mid-levels, when people are finished with the starting zones but they're not at level cap, so they're still leveling up, they're still learning abilities, they're getting items, they're crafting items, they're completing quests, they're earning achievements, they're making friends either to do dungeons with or guilds. Trust me, there is more than enough to do in the mid-level without piling an epic story onto people.

But they still have stories. They still meet NPCs, find new locations, learn about factions, hear lore. Those are all part of the story. These are thick quests that guide them through those things.

So basically, what I'm saying is with those three kinds of quests you have, you can think of it as a graph. So if this is the beginning of time and this is, you know, this isn't—I'm sorry—the amount of quests you have, and this is time going along. So time is higher over here. The Zone story starts off with a lot of zone—I'm sorry—the background story starts off a lot and quickly drops off. His own stories stay pretty high for most of the game. You can even have them at the end of the game; you can still have level cap Zone stories. The end story, hardly anything, and then you start to get a few quests that will lead into the end story, and then by the end, it ramps up really high, and when you're when you're at or near level cap, you get a ton of end story quests.

So, the interesting thing about those end-store requests is leveling is either almost done or is done. The stage is set; people are familiar with all the zones, and they've heard backstories. You can start what I call the real story. It says, "Now that they know all these people in these zones and they're well equipped, hit them with a world-spanning epic storyline." It can involve tons of NPCs you've already met, some of whom like you, some of whom hate you, but you know why they don't start off that way. They're like, "You didn't rescue my daughter," or "You ran over my cat." You know these things. It could have a big finish. You could put a four-hour, 40-hour storyline at the end with a big finish.

And that's the important thing, that Epic World story at the end, I want it to end, but you don't have to worry; there's lots of other things the player has to do, and I'm not talking about that, but the advantage of an end game story is the players are all the same level, so designers can assume they already understand their class, they've met powerful NPCs, they've traveled to most zones, they know the world setting, they own a flying Mount, or they can get one, and they themselves are powerful.

So, examples of world stories could be maybe there's a keep on top of a mountain in an early Zone, everybody tells you about this horrible boss who lives up there, but you have no way of getting there, so it's not even instanced, you just don't have any way of getting there. Later on, when you get a flying Mount and you fly over there, you see that the landing area is swarming with really tough creatures, so you're like, "Hmm, I better come back here when I'm higher level." Boom, example one.

Example two, maybe you're in the middle of a level 20 Zone, and you're fighting along, and you find a locked door leading down into a cave, a mine. When you go to try to find out about it, people tell you, "Oh, this is really powerful." It turns out it's a level 60 instance in the middle of that level 20 Zone, and the key to that door is something you will get for a quest, but the NPC is like, "Oh, you better come back here when you're much more powerful. I'm not going to give you the key just to take it in there and die, and I'll lose the key." So, that could be example two of how you could put a world story embedded in an existing Zone.

**End Zones**

You can also use your end zones. You might have a level 60 boss in your level 60 End Zone. He's Elite, he has tons of lieutenants, you're warned by locals, you may need a very special device to kill this boss, and you get it during the world story. So, these are things that you learn about, but you can immediately go after them if you want. There's nothing stopping you; you're, there's no level or any other restriction on you to go after this character.

What I like about this is, there's a lot of ways in an MMO to feel special. You can solo things. There are consequences to your actions. We were going to put in a newspaper similar to Arcanum's where when you did things, it got reflected in the newspaper. There are, you can gain access to certain instances because of things you've done. Makes you feel special, and NPCs react to you when you come by, when you talk to them, which is a reminder that, "Hey, you've done things. We remember who you are. You're special."

**Rewards**

Now, I talked about, "Hey, when you get to max level, there's still things that reward the player." There's additional stories, in addition to the world-spanning epic story. There's still Zone storage you can go through. There are better items to find, more money to spend on a variety of money sayings the game can provide, recipes to find for crafting, and just Fame, just doing things, getting, getting uh, better known in different zones, getting people, getting titles, and things like that. Those are things that reward people for just being and playing in the world.

So, what do you do after the world story ends?

 People are always like, "Wait, your world story has an end. What happens?" Well, there's still PVP, they're still crafting, there's no daily quests. We had housing, and part of housing was deciding what, uh, you could customize the outside of your house with plugs, like, "Here's an archaeological dig," or "Here's a crafting station," or whatever, and you can also decorate the inside of your house. So there's ten things you want to do there. You might have a lot of item sets that you want to complete; maybe there's a big bonus for wearing a completed item set. There's also raiding; that's what a lot of games just rely on 100%, and that's just one part of what we give people after they do that whole into the, uh, into the game World story.

If you haven't, if you want to do an expansion, the world story can always have some loose ends. Maybe the boss's Lieutenant gets away, or maybe, depending on how you, uh, finished it, there are things that could be come back to haunt you in a, in a sequel. Maybe some new locations are into that, like there are notes or things that talk about a faraway land or an offshore island that you've never been to. And plus, there are always consequences to how you finished it. Maybe there's a whole faction angry at you now, and because you, you killed this person, there could be a whole expansion based on that.

Okay, that was my 40-minute talk compressed down into 15 minutes. So, I hope this explains kind of what I wanted to do with my thought process of what I wanted to get done in WildStar for storytelling. It was informed by my single-player RPGs, but I think it would have worked really well in WildStar. I pretty much stopped playing MMOs about eight years ago, so I don't know if somebody's implemented something like this. Love to hear about it, but that was my GDC 2010 talk in a nutshell.

Tabletop RPG Influences.md
Youtube Link:

https://youtu.be/bNf601IoBpc?si=GZYYJPlK_L4EbQDX

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim, and today I want to talk about tabletop RPG influences that directly show up in my own computer games. Specifically, I want to talk about experiences I had either as a DM or as a player that resulted in something going in my game. In fact, I'm going to answer the question from mud MW 4321 who asks, "Hey Tim, I remember you talking about your super luck character from GURPS which made you want to put luck into Fallout. Is there anything else in your CRPGs that was heavily influenced by your experience in tabletop games? This also goes for narratives that got told at the table and then put into your game. Thanks."

I'm going to repeat a couple of them that appear in other videos just so they're all collected right here, but only a couple. So, you're right, mudw, dumb dialogue or luck in Fallout (sorry, I got ahead of myself), luck in Fallout was because I had played a really lucky character in Champion named Lucky Boy, who had all the levels of luck: he had extraordinary luck, ridiculous luck, super luck, and I had so much fun playing a character with pretty much no other power other than being lucky that I wanted to put that into Fallout because the game was so dark and so gruesome that the idea of something like this, a lux stat that was right there embedded in the system mechanics, was kind of my way of going, "It's okay if things are a little silly, not a lot, but a little."

And then I'm going to say dumb dialogue, which is the other thing I've talked about, came from literally my original High School D&D campaign where I restricted a three-intelligence fighter from using multi-syllable words, and that was directly the origin, the direct origin. I told that story to narrative designers at Interplay, they thought was funny, that's why there's dumb dialogue in Fallout, and then tons of my subsequent games.

But let me tell you some other things that happened. We used to play GURPS a lot in, uh, during the Thursday night thing, which is the get-together we do every Thursday where anybody could come to the conference room and we just play games. And when we were playing GURPS, um, people liked to buy an advantage called Ally, or I think it was Ally group, I think actually it might be both, and what that said was an ally was an NPC with some skill so it wasn't just a generic NPC who would come along to help you on adventures. And people bought that and I would some, and sometimes they'd leave it to me to invent the Ally, and I'm like, sometimes I wanted them to invent the Ally, but I found if I did that, sometimes the Ally would be like the super powerful guy would show up. Sometimes I'd invent the Ally, but in any case, Scott Benny loved that and he was the one who made the Mysterious Stranger perk in Fallout, which was you'd get into combat and occasionally, uh, it was a little luck-dependent, Mysterious Stranger would show up and help you. In our earlier one though, Mysterious Stranger could die, um, he didn't in later Fallouts, in the Bethesda Fallouts, he would show up and do a horrible incapacitating shot that would almost always kill the enemy. In ours, it was just some guy would show up, I think he'd walk in from off-screen, and he'd take part in that combat. In Fallout 1, he hung around after combat too, so we had to put a little conversation on him, but um, in Fallout 2, I think he ran off when combat ended. That's straight out of our GURPS tabletop play with allies.

Another thing, and I know I told this story about, they would, um, frequently run away from encounters when encounters looked like they were too hard. Uh, my players would have no trouble just running away, sometimes leaving other players behind to suffer their fate. This running away from random encounters was something that went into the random encounters that we created in Fallout. They were expected to be all over the board. We, in fact, as you went farther northwest towards where that military base was, there were harder and harder encounters. We intended for you to run away; it was not something was an emergent property when we made those random encounter maps, and we put those grids down, the expectation was if this is too hard, run away. Saw it a lot happen in my CPS campaigns, wanted people to do it in the Fallout game.

So those are some influences on tabletop on Fallout that I remember. Now let's jump to Arcanum. Uh, I know I talked about Judges Guild and how it influenced me. I just want to remind everybody those big overland maps that Judges Guild provided for their Wilderlands campaign was a massive influence on me making Arcanum. I kept thinking of those big maps with just points of interest, not even well defined, like bunch of skeletons here, there's a tower here, maybe there's a dungeon under it, oh there's a graveyard here, I wonder what's going on there. We would just plop these things down. That came straight from Judges Guild, and it was a very different thing than you saw a lot of the TSR modules at the time, which was here is a map of a dungeon, and there might be a paragraph saying this dungeon is under a hill two miles northwest of some ill-defined village. You know, Judges Guild would love to give details, sometimes tiny spotty details, sometimes heavily detailed. I mean, they sold modules like Modin, and oh, there were a lot of other villages you could buy where you could just, uh, Light Elf, the Spies of Light Elf, where here was an entire village defined with NPCs that had motivations and things they were trying to do, and these were set so that when there were dungeons nearby, you had somewhere to go to.

Another thing that I got from a tabletop game, I'm going to show you that in a second, this, this is TOR. I have the box set. TOR was incredibly influential on fate points in Arcanum. We used to play TOR. I wasn't the DM. My friend John really loved this game. He got me and some other friends into it. We would play on the weekends. There was a point in there, I'm trying to remember what they called, were they rift points? I forget what they were called, but they were the direct influence of fate points in Arcanum. Basically, they were things you could say, "Hey GM, this is what I want to happen," and you could force a die roll to make it happen. So, fate points were put in Arcanum so that players, if you hadn't made a save in a while and things weren't going well, you could heal yourself or get a critical or make sure a skill did work. I am going to pick that lock. I am going to disarm that trap. I just like things like that. It was a way it felt made Arcanum feel more like there was a DM you were playing with, that you could interact with that way.

And another big influence in Arcanum were cursed items. I loved cursed items in tabletop D&D, especially if there was something really good, oh, but it had this penalty. And we put

 them into Arcanum because there were some cursed items in Arcanum that were actually really good, especially if you didn't care about the penalty. So this happened a lot in D&D where one of my characters, um, would find a cursed item and would go, "I could imagine not caring about that penalty. It makes people not like me. I don't care." There was a, I mentioned an artifact that a monk found in one of my games that meant he couldn't hold metal, but he was a monk. He attacked with his bare hands and he wore leather breaches. I think he couldn't hold plant material either. He didn't care. He attacked with his fist. He didn't matter. So he found a way of making that cursed item into something awesome. Huge influence. I thought about cursed items from my D&D modules and Judges modules a lot. In fact, there's an entire relic artifact section of the DM guide in first edition and a Judges Guild module of artifacts, and most of them carry some drawbacks but really powerful abilities. Very influential on me.

Now let's jump to Temple of Elemental Evil. The idea of party alignment in there, where you had to pick a party alignment, and then everybody in the party, their alignment had to be within one step of that party alignment, that came from tabletop games I ran in high school where it made absolutely no sense that maybe an assassin and a paladin were in the same party. It's like, why would the paladin even allow this? There were times where, you know, you have a chaotic good player and a lawful evil character, and they're just going to get in arguments all the time, and saying, "Well, they're in the same party," because players just didn't cut it. So I started instituting this idea of, "Hey, I think you guys all have to have alignments that are at least close to each other." And remember, there was that graph, and I said, "It's without counting diagonals, it's one step." So people did that, and it worked, and so I put that into Temple of Elemental Evil.

Similarly, the opening vignettes, we tied that to the party alignment, which was a new thing for Temple, but the idea for that came from my high school D&D campaigns where I didn't like giving people, "Here's your quest, go and do, go and do it." I tried to work them into things because I had a lot of modules that I made myself, and TSR modules, and Judges Guild modules. I would read them and then I'd remember they were there, and I wouldn't place them anywhere in particular, and then when, as often happened, the players needed something, they needed to remove curse, maybe they didn't want that cursed item anymore, or they wanted a raised dead, or they needed a favor from a noble, something, instead of saying, "Well, go do this quest for me, go wipe out this dungeon for me," something generic, you, you'd have the cleric go, "I want this mace of disruption, and I know it's in that dungeon over there, go get it for me." What was fun about that is it gave the dungeon adventure a goal, but it also meant that you could put in a powerful item like a mace of disruption, knowing that the players could use it for a while but eventually they had to give it to the cleric that sent them off, and they'd reinforce that by casting quest or geas on them to make sure they brought back. But that made me think, "Hey, it's much Temple of Elemental Evil would make much more sense if you had an opening vignette that connected into it." One thing I remember doing is there was a treasure item that showed up on rolls. It was just, "You find a treasure map." That was awesome. We used that for one of the opening vignettes, but I used that in my tabletop campaign to connect people to dungeons I had made that I didn't have set any particular place. I just wanted to use it. I made a dungeon for fun, great, I rolled up a treasure map, perfect, it's a treasure map to this dungeon.

Also, in Temple, and this wasn't received as well, but there were henchmen that would only come work for you if you, and they took a chunk of XP, money, and items. The module Temple Elemental Evil calls for that, and I used it, but I did that in my campaign too because I found that if there were henchmen that my characters could get where they pay 100 gold, and now they have these zero-level fighters that tromp along with them, they used them as meat shields, they treated them horribly. But if you wanted anybody any a little better than that, I didn't want them to treat him like that. If they wanted a wizard because he had some spells or a priest for heals, I wanted them to treat them better, and I found that if they took a chunk of XP, money, items, that the players took them more seriously. Now I know a lot of people in Temple didn't like that rule, and people even talked about that before we shipped, and I said, "Well, then they don't have to take those people," but it was controversial, but I'm glad I put it in, and that did come from my tabletop.

And then the final one, and I don't remember if I talked about this before, but there is a random encounter in Temple with a Bard named Zeaxis. He's looking, uh, he's the son of Yaxis and X-axis, and he's looking for his sister, Imaginary Axis, I Axis, who is an illusionist, and no one's seen her in years. But this is a real character. This is my brother's character sheet. That is a picture of Ricardo Montalban in Circus of the Stars, which is why he's wearing a onesie. Um, he was doing acrobatics, circus, uh, acrobatics on a trapeze, uh, up in the air. Um, what was cool about this was this character always stuck with me. He was named Zis Malabon because that's a picture of Ricardo Montalban. He, we had so much fun with that character. I think my brother got him up to like seventh level in Bard. Remember, you have to go through fighter and thief first, so it's a pretty powerful character. He shows up in Temple as a random encounter, and that's who it is. It's that character from my high school campaign.

Later games of mine after Temple, there weren't a lot of tabletop influences, mainly because I had used my biggest ones already, and I wasn't playing tabletop as much, starting with Vampire and then later in my career. I didn't play as many tabletop RPGs, so I drew from other sources. But I hope, mud MW, this answers your question about what other things happened on my tabletop RPGs that went into my computer RPGs.

Taking Games Seriously.md
Youtube Link:
https://youtu.be/mVHopxLcPwI?si=S_BVVjpErKyB1LLj

Hi everyone, it's me Tim. Today I want to talk about taking games seriously. I actually want to answer a question from rvic, although I'm wondering if that's rvic asks, "Can games be taken too seriously?" and my short answer is yeah, sure, anything can be taken too seriously, but I want to make a longer answer than that. I almost just wrote "yes" as a comment, but I want to take it make a longer answer because first of all, you're asking me, there's very little I take seriously. Usually, on anything, I'm willing to concede and go okay.

But to make my answer clearer, I love when people deep dive into the lore and the setting and mechanics of my games. In fact, when we're making it, that's often we're thinking about people doing that. We want people to do that. I remember turning to Leonard Bari at one point (I forget what game it was, probably Fallout or Arcanum) and I said, "Are people going to get this?" It was something subtle, deep in the game, and he went, "The right people will get it," which means occasionally we put things in thinking this is only for the people who deep dive.

When I've talked about writing dialogues and how I hate lore dumps where you're talking to someone and there's pages of dialogue you have to get through, and you're tapping, and your character's going, "Uh-huh, tell me more, yeah," I hate that. We used to shove lore dumps like that into cinematics or books or computer terminals, so you could read it if you wanted it. If you want to deep dive, it's there for you to do so, but you don't have to.

Because I get people who just play games for fun. There are a lot of games that I play just for fun. I'm not taking them very seriously. I'm not learning all the lore. I'm just having fun. Maybe it's based on an IP I've already know, or it's just got fun mechanics, and I'm just having fun enjoying the game. So I'm not going to deep dive into it, but I love when people do, and I love when people talk online about it.

I'm indebted like every other game developer to people who make wikis on games that connect all the stories and the lore and the creatures and the spells and everything because often, by the time the game ships, well, within a few months of the game shipping, that wiki is probably more detailed and more used than anything we created in-house.

My only problem with people who take games too seriously is when they get nasty about it, and you know what I'm talking about. These are people who belittle others who don't know the lore or who are just playing to enjoy it, which is perfectly fine. I really hate it when those people exclude the others, like, "You're not a real gamer. You're not a hardcore gamer because you don't know the lore backwards and forwards." Who cares? My rule for this is really simple: enjoy things that you enjoy and enjoy them the way you want to because guess what, if other people don't enjoy it the way you enjoy it, that does not harm you in the slightest. Just keep on enjoying it the way you enjoy it, let them enjoy it differently, or even let them dislike it.

It's why I don't like it when people, when they don't like something, they make hate videos and stuff. It's like, you know what, just move on. I'm a big fan of the "vote with your money" because all the arguments I've seen against "vote with your money" somehow implies that people either can't control themselves, like they have to pre-order the game, they can't read reviews for it, or they're not smart enough to do that, and I don't like either of those explanations. People should just buy the things they want, don't buy the things that they don't like, and market forces will correct that.

However, there's an opposite side to this rule of taking things too seriously. It goes the opposite way, and I've mentioned this before. When I decided to go into making games, I had a lot of people go, "Oh yeah, that's perfect for you, that's wonderful," including my mom. She said, "I mean, I was in the middle of working on my PhD, I had gotten the Masters, and I was working on a PhD in computer science, and I said, 'Mom, I think I'm going to stop and go make games.' She goes, 'Yeah, I can see that, that's you.' Other people, friends, other family members, other students, my own PhD thesis adviser were like, 'You're wasting your life, and you've wasted all the time you've put into this, and you've wasted some of our time too.' And well, funny enough, cut move forward a few years and cut to this same professor coming to me to ask me to teach a class at that university.

But another argument I've had people say, and people have said this on this channel, is, "Why aren't you doing something more valuable for society? Why aren't you curing disease or feeding the hungry or any of the other things you could be doing that's a lot more valuable to society than making another game?" Or as I put it, making a computer go beep boop. Well, this is the classic, "Why did we go to the moon when we hadn't cured the common cold?" And there's so many things wrong with viewing things like that.

But all I can say about that for me is, one, my skill set is not in medicine or agriculture or anything else. It's pretty much programming and storytelling, and I've played a lot of games, and I love making mechanics. In fact, mechanics to me is a lot like programming. So if those are the things I'm good at, shouldn't I do things that people enjoy that stem from my skill set? I think that just makes sense.

But the second thing is, I don't want to live in a world that doesn't have art or music or games of any kind just because diseases and hunger and poverty still exist. It's a form of extreme utilitarian philosophy to make that argument that as long as you could be doing something that improves the world, you shouldn't be doing these other things. I recently read a book by Michael Shore called "How to Be Perfect." Michael Shore is the guy who made "The Good Place," which I absolutely love, that show, which, by the way, a lot of good philosophy lessons in that show. But a good example of the problem with utilitarian philosophy is that's true for everything. You could take it to an extreme and say every dollar that isn't buying you food and shelter should be put in, you should be giving it away to charity to people less fortunate. You, every minute that you're not working or sleeping, you should be doing something for charity or for people less fortunate than you because it would make everything better. The problem with that philosophy is it takes into account nothing about your needs, and I'm saying needs here, not just desires. Some people have a need to do things that they enjoy. Sure, they can do other things, but after a while, that's when you burn

 out, that's when you have a midlife crisis, or for some people, a young life crisis, and that's bad.

So I want, well I should say wanted, I wanted to do these things. I wanted to make these games. I had a bunch of games of me I wanted to make, just like I think the generation before me had movies they wanted to make and the generation before that had the great novel they wanted to write. That was in me, and I wanted to get these things out. So I feel like I did that, and that's good.

I don't want people to take my work over seriously, like I've said. I don't want them to use it to belittle or exclude other people, but at the same time, I don't want them to just write it off as a frivolous activity. I think I can say I left the world a better place than the one I entered. I think I left the game development world a little better than when I entered, and I think there are games coming out. Whenever I see a game mention that they were inspired by Fallout, I'm like, yes.

So, rvic, I hope this answered your question. Yes, games can be taken too seriously, and the flip side is people may working on them can also be belittled too much. I think both of those are extreme views, and I think what we should instead do is be grateful that there's people out there making fun games for us to play, and at the same time, realize they games we can have fun, we can deep dive, but at a certain point, they're games. Move on.

Anyway, Ric, I hope that answered your question.

Team Size.md
Youtube Link:
https://youtu.be/gC0KWoK5XhA?si=kgHj6QYtNmmDwNGp

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim. Today, I want to talk about a topic that was suggested to me by a co-worker, or I should say, by someone who's working at one of the companies I'm currently contracting at. And he asked, "I'd love to hear your thoughts on the ever-expanding team size on projects and the impact that has on the process of making games." And that's a good question because I've been doing this a long time, and teams are steadily getting bigger. They don't always get bigger. I've gone from some bigger teams to some smaller ones, but in general, games are taking more and more people to make.

So, I thought I'd talk about that. Let me give you a quick background. I've made games with teams as small as three or four people, and by team, I'm talking about the actual people who are working together to make it, and not the people who come in later to maybe like if you contract out some art or you contract out the localization or someone comes in to make your box cover or something like that. I'm not necessarily talking about that because those are often in the past and now frequently things that are sent out for someone to do. I'm talking about what you would call as the in-house development team.

So, I've worked on ones that are as small as three or four people, and I've worked on big ones that are almost 200 people, usually it's around 50 to 70. It probably averaged in the 90s in the High Teens to 30s and then starting in the 2000s got bigger, and by the 2010s were regularly about 50 to 60 people if not 70 to 80.

As usual, when I answer questions like this, I don't have a definitive answer, but I can tell you that there are a lot of pros and cons to big teams. So, let me just talk about it in terms of let's talk about all the good things about being on a big team and all the bad things about being on a big team because small teams are pretty much the opposite of all that.

The advantage of having a big team is you get to make a big game. That sounds relatively straightforward, but there are some games that you just really can't do with a small team. It's hard to make a really long and involved RPG with modern art and the level that people expect of how many hours it would be and how many characters there are and how many different places you can go and how detailed it looks and how many items there are. It's hard to make that with a small group. MMOs are another example of a really specific genre that needs a lot of people because it has everything. You have to make the game itself, there's networking involved, there's data servers, there's the security, there's all the service stuff that comes with it for people doing subscription or wanting to change accounts, and just the fact that MMOs tend to be large.

Similarly, for GaaS games, games as a service, GaaS, those require a lot of people who are considered to be on the team because they're in the trenches every day, but because your game has a live component, this thing has to be maintained. Large teams also let you have specialists. When I was in the 80s and 90s, I learned how to wear many hats at once: producer, designer, programmer. Things that have changed as over time and as teams have gotten bigger, you end up with specialists. You may have a programmer who just does lighting or just writes pixel shaders, or you may have an artist who just, all they do is light levels. They don't actually make any of the props in the level, they don't actually put the level together, but they light it. And if you give people a really good specialist like that, you can have some absolutely gorgeous-looking games and some fantastic features. Things like gunplay, there are designers who specialize in how guns feel and reload and animate and fire, and how reactions happen to it. This is a big deal. This is, these are people that pay attention to the frame by frame of what goes on when you're doing gunfights. Writing is something that's been specialized. It used to be people on the team just did the writing in addition to whatever else they were doing, and then we started getting narrative designers, and now we have people who are specifically good at writing dialogue, and people are good at writing lore, and people are good at writing the scripts for a cinematic. There's just, or, or for ads, and there's so many different ways that people can become good within the specialization within the overall narrative design field.

Also, as teams get bigger, you end up with a community manager that's just for you, who can handle posts and questions that come in, can handle your forums, and they're, they're just on your game. And that's something that's incredibly fun and great to have, especially when you're doing conventions and you're going to do a round table. If you have a dedicated community manager, he or she can tell you, "These are the kind of questions people have been asking. These are the kind of questions we might expect to get if we open up to a Q&A." Those are really good to have.

There's a phrase, "more hands make less work." I think it's Canadian. I don't know. I think I may have seen it on Letterkenny. But what that means is when you spread out a lot of work, it can get done faster and better. Really difficult tasks can be broken down so multiple people can work on them. Also, things that are considered drudgery. I don't want to give specifics because some people really like some of the work like that, but there's a lot of parts of a game that many people consider to be drudgery work. Spreading that out among additional people is a lifesaver because then no one person is stuck doing all of that work.

And then the final one that I can think of as a pro to having a big team, in theory, you can get a game out faster. Sometimes, sometimes you have a big team because you're making such a big game, you have to have a big team. But I know in companies that are trying to get games out for a console cycle because consoles aren't out there for about what, eight to ten years, and then they come up with a new one. That's if games take three or four years, that's a window you have to get games out. So, a lot of companies like to have big teams, and then they stagger production so that you always have a pre-production team that's ready to start a new game once the old game gets past that phase, and you have prop artists that already make art for your game, concept artists that are ready to do all the concept for all the different art you're going to need for the game. They're ready to go in stages so you can get games out faster. And that's something that's probably only true for when you have big teams, you can often stage them on different games as those games need more or less people in different stages because the early pre-production stage is very different than the production stage, which is very different than the fixing the bugs and optimization stage at the very end. Usually

, you know, you need concept artists at the very beginning, lots of artists in the middle, you don't need a lot of artists at the end because usually all that's done. So, that's a good example of how you can shift people around to other projects, and when you have a lot of people, you can fill up all those phases.

So, those are the advantages of having a big team. Let's talk about the disadvantages. There's a lot of communication overhead needed when you have a big team. You need to track and sync a lot of work. So, bigger games mean more meetings, more emails, more documentation, larger databases of tasks and bugs. This is just the nature of the beast. Communication overhead goes up. I believe it's exponential with the number of people. So, the difference between a 10 person team and a 30 person team and a 100 person team, the communication overhead is huge. It goes up much bigger than just the size of the team. Keeping all those parts moving is a lot harder. When there's just a few people, it's easy to keep everybody busy. Everyone's getting tasks, uh, taking the minute, the rate they're working. You can see where there's any bottlenecks. It's, but to keep all those parts moving when there's a hundred people, 200 people, that's a lot of work. That means you mean you need more producers because you need more production to handle all the team members that are doing work, all the data that has to be tracked, all the parts of the game that need to be estimated and bug-tracked and localized. Somebody's got to do that and keep that moving. That means you have more production, production members. And I'm not saying this as to belittle what they're doing. They're not actually making the game. They're letting all of us be able to make the game, so production's needed. But as you have more people, you need more production, and those production people aren't generating content for the game.

I've noticed that when teams get bigger, it leads to less familiarity between team members. And I think that's just human. It's hard to keep, you know, you could be friends with two or three people. You can be loose friends with 20 or 30 people, but once it gets over 50 people, there's going to be people on this team that you literally don't know. You don't know who they are. You don't know what they do. And I've noticed that leads to misunderstandings when people thought somebody was working on something and they weren't, or they were supposed to do it a certain way and they weren't. It can also lead to mistrust. You may think someone's not working hard because their particular job involves a lot of thinking, so you see them sitting at their desk a lot like this, and it doesn't look like they're doing anything. So, I've seen mistrust grow in bigger teams.

Probably the biggest problem that I see in big teams, though, is tiny little mistakes can get magnified into really big problems. Here's some examples. Let's say you've done a bunch of scripts on your game, and that's kind of like code that's handled as data that that non-programmers can write. If you have a small game and there's a problem with the script uh interpreter, and so you need to redo your scripts, maybe they need something added to the top, maybe they need flags put on them, and you need to redo all the scripts. In a small game, you could do that in a day. In a big game, that may take a month, and it may take a few people working that month. It becomes a big problem.

Similarly, let's say, um, you're making a game, and all of a sudden, the publisher, the admin above you, whoever's giving you money, says, "Oh, we want, we need to add a new language. It needs to be done in this other language as well." Hey, if you have a small game, you may have 10,000 words, 20,000 words. No biggie. A big game, that may have half a million to a million words. Adding a new language is a huge, huge deal. It also depends on what the language is. Some languages are easier to translate into because you don't need a new font added to the game, so you don't need to pull in more people. By the way, that may be a specialist person.

You also have to worry because some languages, you know, genderize nouns, especially if you're doing generated dialogue like I did on Arcanum, and I have a video about that. Some languages have honorifics, so you need to record the stations of the social class of the NPCs because the dialogue will get written differently, and the person doing the localization may have a question beyond just, "Is this a man talking or a woman talking?" They mean, you know, "Is this a shop clerk talking? Is this a noble person that's being addressed?" Because that will change how they localize those dialogues.

Similarly, let's say you make a misestimate in how long it's going to take to make some part of the game. In a small game, that may cost you ten thousand dollars, maybe fifty thousand dollars. But that may seem like a lot of money, but in the huge scope of making a game, it's not. However, in a big game, a small 10% estimate may mean you're off by a million dollars or 10 million dollars, and suddenly you're talking about a lot of money. And that money's got to come from somewhere. And we're not even talking crunch. We're talking, uh, 10% misestimate was applied to some portion of the game. This is a big deal.

I've heard of games that have had five hundred, a thousand, two thousand people on them, and not all at the same location, spread out around the country, spread out around the world. I'm working as a contractor now on a district with a distributed team that are literally all over the planet. They're all over the US, they're all over Europe, uh, they're in Asia and Australia as well. So, just finding a time to have a meeting with that group can be difficult. Part of the fact that I wake up at five in the morning, so I've said, "Oh yeah, I can be available at six or seven a.m. for a meeting," has come into play sometimes. They said, "We're going to take you up on that." I had a meeting at 7:15 the other day. That's fine with me.

So, I think I've run over most of the pros and cons I can think of for team size. So, let me just say this. If I had my druthers, if I had to pick, it's like someone gave me a bag of money and said, "Make whatever game you want," I would rather use a smaller team over a longer period of time because you get all the advantages of that small team without a lot of the cons of the bigger team. And the longer time means you can maybe make bigger scoped games than you otherwise could. I do understand, though, because I've encountered in the past that sometimes

 you just need a big team, so they're not always avoidable.

I'd say for introverts, smaller teams are nice because you just have less communication overhead, but I've seen people get into areas on big teams where they themselves don't need a lot of interaction, so there's room for everyone on every team. But I hope this gives you some insight into how team size can affect game scope and game management.

Technological Evolution

https://youtu.be/rr61gn2k46o?si=nf9k_tgdM0fjQs6V

Hi everyone, it's me Tim. Today I want to talk about technological evolution, specifically I'm going to try to answer a question from Bavid Deckham 411 who asks, "What was your experience with the technological evolution we've gone through during your time making and playing games? Was it ever a source of stress or were you excited to keep up?"

I'll give you the TL;DW: it was exciting and stressful. It's... I'll have to go back a long time ago to explain it, but like even when I was a kid, we started getting little handheld games like Kico Football and things like that. And then suddenly there was a Pong unit out which you hooked up to the TV, and then within a year or two, there was a console, the first console, Atari VCS, which took cartridges. And you're like, "Whoa, that's it." It started playing games that looked like they were in the arcade, and you were like, "Whoa, this is crazy." You know, that led to all kinds of things: Cico Vision, Intellivision, Nintendo... Just things just kept coming and coming and coming.

As a consumer, it's fun, but also you had to realize that you could buy something and then literally the next year, sometimes 6 months later, it was obsolete. That really hit the stride with PCs. You would buy a PC and it would be obsolete within months, as a better sound card or video card or processor or monitor came out.

So, I'm not going to talk about that side, I'm not talking about the consumer side. I'm going to talk about my experience starting in 1981 of trying to make games where your target was constantly shifting. And this is the thing I've always told people: the huge difference between writing a book or making a movie or making a TV show is the pace of technological change in those doesn't hold a candle to computer. I mean, yes, they've developed new cameras and different lighting solutions and better microphones, but in general, directing is the same now as it was maybe 20 years ago, 40 years ago. That's not how it works in computer games. Every time something changed technologically, it would make old games not work, it would make... it would open up a plethora of choices you could make for new games, way different than movies. Now have color, movies now have sound. We're talking, you couldn't do realistic graphics, now you can. How realistic? You know, you can add in cutscenes, how many? Well, now we have CD-ROMs, you can add a ton. You have space for way more data. We can make higher resolution art. We can just... it expanded exponentially, it felt like every year. And it was keep up or die.

So let me walk through some of these choices I made. So the very first game I made, um, that I started around '83 and it shipped in '86, was Grand Slam Bridge. It may look like it's graphical, but this is all text-based. This was put together in a text mode using ASCII characters that already existed. We didn't have to define any. So because of this, it worked on any PC. It still works. Was it a very interesting way of doing a game? Now, I then went off to grad school for a few years, and when I dove back into making games in '91 with B Tail Construction Set, suddenly I was doing a game in VGA. And VGA was the new hot thing in a sense because when we did Baril Construction Set, we had to put in support for the old mode, EGA, and the even older mode, CGA. So, VGA, for 320x200 resolution, gave us 256 colors, but EGA only gave us 16, CGA only gave us four. And those four were predefined; it was black, white, magenta, and some purpley color, I don't remember what it was, or maybe it was magenta and mauve. And there were two different CGA modes; you either got black, white, and these two colors, or black and white and these two colors, predefined. So, good luck making graphics you want in a low resolution where you can't even pick the colors you want.

Now, by the time I started Fallout in '94, in early '94, in fact, I had to work this out exactly when I started. I started working on it probably January '94 because, yes, I'm putting together a timeline for many reasons. But the very first meeting with Steve Jackson Games to talk about GURPS for the new game was in March '94. And that's where I can put a pin in it. I know the game was definitely in development by March of '94; it was just me, no one else would be assigned to it until August of that year. But I can say for sure in March '94, but probably a month or two earlier, by January or February, Fallout had begun development. By that time, VGA, this is what, three years after Bale because I did Rags to Riches in between. By now, we're up to 640x480 resolution with 256 colors. That was a huge leap up, that's... um, almost five times. It's between four and five times the resolution of 320x200. But to do this mode, which is called Super VGA, you had to bank switch because the PC could only access 64k of memory, and that mode required four and a half times that much memory. So you had to bank switch. There were the first few scan lines would be on one bank, and then the next set of scan lines would be on the next bank, and the next set of scan lines would be on the next bank. So depending where vertically on the screen you were drawing a pixel, you had to tell the video card, "Switch to this bank now, I'm going to write into you."

When we did Fallout, every video card bank switched differently, and you had to learn that and do it in assembly, no option. Which meant you had to ask the consumer, "What video card do you have?" Hope they knew. And sometimes it was different; it was, "Do you have a Trident 9600 chipset A? Do you have a Trident 9600 chipset B? Do you have a Trident 9600 chipset C?" They bank switched differently. If you didn't know, you could ask it to autodetect, which was not super 100% reliable, or you could just ask them to guess. And we're like, "Guess something. I'm going to try to display a screen. Pray you don't crash. And if they could see something, then you could move on."

Lu, IL Vasa came out. VASA was the Video Entertainment Standards Association, I think. You can look it up. Anyway, VASA made things easier, but it didn't come out early enough for Fallout to fully take advantage of it. We shipped with a Super VGA VASA driver, and we recommended that people download one if this one wasn't appropriate for you. So then you could just say, "I'm in VASA, go ahead and play." That worked better than trying to guess, but still. Also, we discovered there was...

 Fallout was the one and only Mac game I made because when a new Mac OS would come out, all the old software would break. There was no backward compatibility, and Apple cared very little about games. I could do a whole video about that. I'm not going to because I don't really care about Apple. I mean, I have an iPhone, I love it, but I'm going to show as much interest in Apple as Apple ever showed in my games or the game industry, which is very little. But whenever a new Mac OS would come out, it would invalidate the game. In fact, like I said in another video, once, people can play Fallout easier by playing the Windows version on a Mac under an emulator or a partition where you've installed something to run a Windows-like OS better and easier than trying to get the Mac version running on a Mac.

So, by the time Arcanum came out in 2001, we had upped the resolution to 800x600, still 256 colors, but it was VASA now, and VASA made everything easier. VASA cards usually shipped with a VASA-compliant driver, meaning you could just tell the card through a VASA set of interrupts or API function calls. All you need to know is, "Hey, I want to run 800x600, 256 color," and it would go, "I got you. It's set up." And then, as you wrote to it, you could just call a VASA-supplied bank-switching routine, and it would say, "I'll figure out how to switch banks for you. Rock on." By then, we weren't doing Mac versions because I was like, "I'm done with this." But the Windows and DirectX versions kept updating, literally, while we were making the game. New Windows would come out, new DirectX versions would come out, and it was hard to keep up. Now, yes, Windows had backward compatibility, and that helped. That let you run games, it still lets you today run games from a long time ago, but it's not perfect. It can be a little janky, it can cause some issues in HUD and frame rate and things like that, but it works. However, I'll give you an idea, just when we were making Arcanum, we started on Windows 95 and Windows NT, but then Windows 98 came out, and then Windows 98 Second Edition came out, and then Windows 2000 came out, and then Windows ME came out, and then right when we shipped, Windows XP came out. We had to check all of those. You have to check that your game works on all of them. And not just does it start, but does its frame rate good? Is it stable? Do some of the calls you're making into that version of the operating systems still work? And that was a pain. By the way, Windows cycled, a new version of XP came out every year for the rest of the time we ran Troika from '98 through... Well, the new, the first XP came out in 2001, through 2005 when we shut down. There was just a new version of XP every year. It's hard to keep up with that.

But keep in mind, I'm just describing making games that are 2D. Temple of Elemental Evil was our first game that had 3D video graphics usage. The backgrounds were still 2D, but we had a 3D collision mesh, and we had 3D characters, so we had to go through the 3D API on the card. And a lot of video cards came out, 3D, they all did 3D slightly differently. You tend to go through DirectX and do it that way, so you had to handle that. Well, then when we did Vampire, just a couple of years later, everything was all 3D. And yes, we used an engine, but everything was 3D. Then you had, it was learning a new way of making a game. You had to worry about, you know, polygon count, your texture sizes, all these things that you didn't worry about on 2D because that was rendered into sprites, and then you just had to worry about how big the sprites were. In 3D, you have to worry about a lot of other things as well. Keep in mind too that for the programmers and the level designers, suddenly, math is super important. You could probably have gotten by in the video game industry with no math if you were like narrative or, or even art. Nope, not good enough. Trig was probably helping you out there, sines, cosines, angles. But once you went 3D, artists, programmers especially, you had to know linear algebra, you had to know vectors, you had to know matrices, and you had to know them well. So, that was a huge shift in the industry. Luckily, I'd gone to engineering school, so when suddenly people were talking about vectors and quaternions, I'm like, "Yeah, I know that." I knew programmers who didn't, and they stayed 2D. I don't want to... stayed 2D for the rest of his career, for the next 20 years, he just stayed 2D.

Notes, I haven't even touched on languages. My first game was in... Grand Slam Bridge, every game was in C until Vampire, which was in C++. It stayed C++ until my first Unity game, Pillars of Eternity, which was C#. But then when we did Outer Worlds and Unreal, we were back to C++. You know, I'll do a whole video on that. I could... I've talked for a long time. I could talk... I could do a whole video on languages.

But let me touch a little on engines because I do have a video on game engines. I made my own engines from the very beginning, in '81, all the way through to 2011. I made my own engine with one exception, Vampire: Bloodlines, which was on the Source engine, and that was in... that was from what, 2001 to 2004. So then when I got to Obsidian, they had some of their own internal engines that were proprietary. So just so you know, we made... South Park was made on an engine that they had made for Dungeon Siege 3, even though the two games don't look at all alike. But once I did that game and we switched to Pillars, then it was on Unity. We were using someone else's engine, and Unity doesn't give you source code, so you basically did whatever Unity said you could do. And if you couldn't do it, you'd ask them, but who knows if it would get done. Then I finally, Outer World, we switched to Unreal. Whole new engine, you had to learn a whole new way of doing things, different language, C++ from the C# in Unity. And you had access to the engine, so if there's something you wanted to do, you could change the engine. But from then on, you were responsible for that change. Whenever you got an update to the engine, you had to fold your change back in. You had to merge it. It's the whole thing. Programmers know what I'm talking about.



So, this has been a long video. Let me just sum up: technological evolution has been going since the first day I was in this industry in 1981, all the way up through now, in 2024. It never ends. You need to accept it and get used to it. For anyone sitting there right now, no... Unity will be around forever. Unreal will be around forever. No, it won't. And you're already starting to feel that maybe those things aren't going to be around forever. So, new engines will come out, they'll get displaced, they won't keep up, or they're change so dramatically from one version to another, you have to relearn everything. So, I'm just telling you, it never ends. This is both exciting because you get to learn something new literally all the time. It's also stressful because you have to learn something new all the time. And I can't think of... nobody's really immune to this. You may think, "I'll do narrative design." You get more dialogue, now there's voiceover, now there's lip syncing. These are all things that factor into what you're going to do. There's no escaping it. So, my take on it is embrace it and love it because that's what this industry is all about: technological evolution.

So, I hope that answers your question, Bavid Deham 411.

Temple Of Elemental Evil Press Event.md
Youtube Link:
https://youtu.be/Fo-tYpW9m98?si=FUafG3ktgdQjc29X

It's me, Tim, and today I want to talk about the Temple of Elemental Evil press event. I had a lot of fun talking a few days ago about going to the Fallout 3 launch party, so I thought I'd talk about this because this is an actual crooked game. This happened in July of 2003. Atari was doing a press event, a combined press event for a lot of different games that they had, and they were doing it in London, which I thought was kind of interesting. I was not gonna go. I'm not a huge traveler. I don't mind flying, although I don't like driving, but I'm just not a very good traveler. I've gotten better since, but back then, I was like the idea of taking a long flight and then spending a week in London wasn't a good idea for me. Besides, we were trying to finish Temple, and there was a lot of stuff left to do, so I think either Tom Decker, who was a producer and a narrative designer along with me, or Mike McCarthy, the lead artist, one of them were going to go to this. But it turns out, of course, you need a passport, and since we weren't told about this until I think about a month before, just a few weeks before, you weren't going to get a passport that quickly unless you expedited it and spent a day up in LA. So, I had a passport. I went, but just to caveat about this, my stories, my notes are really poultry around this time. This is the very end of what I call my last, my lost decade. So, it wasn't until after Temple shipped that I decided I need to start doing more than just spending six or seven days a week at the office. So, I didn't take a whole lot of notes on this. I did take pictures, so I'm gonna be able to show you pictures. Some of them, just like I had to look at them and go, what was this? 

Anyway, so I flew LAX to London, very long flight, and then as soon as I got there, I was whisked away. Atari sent a car to Hever Castle, which is about an hour south of London, beautiful. They put me up in the castle. It has an extension that's more modern, huge rooms. Got a tour of the castle, you know, the inside and the outside, beautiful grounds, hedges, swans, ponds, the whole works. And coming from Southern California, London, and its environment, that I should say, England is very green and very wet. One thing to mention about the castle was it was plumbing and electricity were added later; it predates all of that. So, like my bedroom, the bathroom was simply the room next to it that they turned into a bathroom, so it was huge. It was like there was a tub in one corner, a sink in another corner, a toilet in another corner. It was very strange. It was like it was like being in a full-size bedroom that just looked like was decked out to be a bathroom, which is what it was. But it also meant that the electricity was not set up to have all these people show up and set up PCs and monitors and big TV screens and stuff. We blew out their fuses several times. They had to run long electrical cords to other parts of the castle just to put us onto other circuits. Atari had a really good IT guy who helped us out. We couldn't have done it without him. We then spent, I think it was a couple of days doing the Press event. The first day was the main one. Most of us gave demos. I demoed Temple of Elemental Evil, went really well. I showed a special map we made that we could show off a fight with Hill Giants. Also, went through some of the random encounter maps, and I think I ran into the temple. The secret level was there, showing off Magic the Gathering Battlegrounds, which looked really cool. Artifact Entertainment was there. They showed off Horizons, not Horizon Zero Dawn. This is another Horizons called Empire of Istaria. There were other demos shown. I feel bad I didn't take notes, and now I don't remember what they were, but it was a really cool first day of demos. That night, Atari set up a really cool reception with musicians playing classical music, music of the time on instruments of the time, wearing clothing made to look like, you know, people that would wear. So, that was fun. And then we went inside, and they fed us what would have been eaten around that, you know, soups and meats and vegetable dishes prepared from the era. It was very cool. It was very cool. The next day, we did another. There was more demos, and there was also a lot of interviews, so I often found myself sitting outside when the sun would come out at various tables that they'd set up around the grounds just doing interview after interview after interview. One reason they did it in England is all the different press from all around Europe came there rather than come to the states later to see it. So, I found myself just doing interview after interview after interview with people who otherwise wouldn't have been able to talk to anybody from Troika. So, that was really cool. It was very exhausting. There was some mistake made, and none of us had rooms that night, so we had to pack up at lunch and throw all of our bags in a truck, and then we were taken a few miles away to a golf resort where we spent that night, and then we came back the third day for, I think it was a few last rounds of interviews, and then we were whisked up to London. And I thought there was going to be more interviews or things set up, you know, maybe even television. Nope, they were done. Luckily, I had added a few extra days, so one of the comms, Communications guy from the Atari London office, showed me around London. We took the tube, saw a lot of different sites, Piccadilly Circus. It was a blur. We went really fast. He walked really fast, and then we ended up eating that evening at The Ivy, which is a really fancy restaurant in London, delicious food. I had the next day free, all by myself, so I went to the British Museum, which is pretty awesome. Went to Saint Paul's Cathedral, which looked really cool, but the exterior was being renovated, so it was covered in scaffolding. I crossed the Millennium Bridge, having no idea where I was going at that point, and I came upon the Tate Modern, which turned out to be one of the highlights of my trip, very interesting, eclectic art. I think the first thing I saw was I walked into a room, and there was a urinal, just lying on the ground, and I wasn't sure what was going on. It turned out it wasn't art installation. I didn't get it. Went to the next room, and nobody was there, nobody was in the room except for a guard bored by the door, and hanging upside down from the ceiling was a grand piano. And I looked at the guard, and I looked at the piano, and looked back at the guard, and I said, "Can I walk under it?" and he just went. So, I went

 to go under it, and I was looking up at it when all of a sudden its connection broke, and it fell, and it got just a few feet over my head and it exploded. The keys came off, strings popped out, the top fell open, and it went, and I was like this under it looking, and I looked up at it, and it had stopped, and I noticed all the things that popped off it were connected with wires, and it slowly lifted up and started to reassemble itself. And I looked over at the guard, and he was going, and I was like, "What was that?" And he goes, "It does that every hour. It was hilarious to see your reaction." I was like, "Happy to entertain." So, I think that night, there was a huge soccer match, so the entire hotel, every floor, people were yelling and screaming. I got up at 4 AM, drove back to Heathrow, came back to the States. So, interesting thing at the end, and this is another reason I don't have a lot of notes. So, days after I get back, this was the end of July, 2003, so very early August, just a few days after I got back, kidney stone. I woke up in the middle of the night in agony, went to the ER, got pushed to the head of the queue on a CT scanner. They found the kidney stone, they gave me some really powerful intravenous drugs, sent me home saying it would pass in a day or two. It did not. That kidney stone was in me for four months, hurting the entire time. So, I was on painkillers like Vicodin and something else, strong, the entire time from August until almost Christmas of 2003. So basically, during the final stages of Temple, when balancing, bug fixing, and other fixes were happening, I was effectively knocked out of my gourd on painkillers. We shipped, and we did several patches. I was knocked out of my gourd on painkillers, so that's why I often tell people Temple wasn't my best effort because for a game that took us was scheduled for reading 18 months and was done in 20, I spent four of those months knocked out of my gourd on painkillers. So, I usually would have taken notes when I got back on this press event, but all I had were my photos. So, I hope I remember most of it, and I hope it's interesting to see kind of like this is a 2003 Time Capsule of the game industry. But it was a fun event, and it kind of made me sort of like traveling again. So, there was that. Anyway, I hope you like it.

The Arcanum One-Point Fiasco.md

https://youtu.be/keTG-5WPccU?si=oOe3aL-qcqzGRbbm

Hey everyone, it's me Tim. Today, I want to talk about what I now call, in very distant hindsight, the Arcanum One Point Fiasco. But let me give you context. I love to give context. So recently, I had someone who was a director at a company ask me how I made decisions as a director. They were often asked to make decisions on things that they weren't quite sure about, either it wasn't in their area of expertise or they just weren't sure there were multiple solutions and they weren't sure. And at the end of this video, I'll tell you what I told them, not because I don't want to tell you now, but because you need to understand big things that happened to me to understand why I gave this person the answer I did.

Now, I talked about in The Fallout video that there were decisions made that I didn't 100% agree with. One of them was the ending. I wanted it to be a happy party, yay you saved the vault. Leonard Boyarsky suggested no, you get kicked out of the Vault by the overseer, and eventually everyone's like, "Why? I want to kill him." And so, we threw away in for you to kill him too. This is what we shipped with, and people loved it. And I remember thinking, "Wow, we almost went with my idea on the party, which I think now people would have thought was stupid." So, it's that little thing that goes in your head like, "All your decisions are good ones."

But there was another thing, there was the timer that we had for finding the water chip, that if you didn't find the water chip by a certain amount of time, the game would just end. I hated it. About half the team liked it, about half the team didn't, some people didn't feel strongly, so I had to guess kind of where on that dividing line they were. But then, when it was suggested, "Hey, there's ways of extending the timer, like, you know, getting the water merchants in The Hub to send water to your vault," this was kind of used to sway more people, and I realized most people wanted it. We shipped with it, people hated it, especially because it made the game feel so rushed that even though we had all these side quests and side areas, people felt like they couldn't do them. So, we patched it and removed it, and I remember thinking, "Ugh, I wish I'd gone with my original decision on that." But of course, in the back of my mind, I was thinking, "Well, your original idea for the ending wouldn't have been good."

So, that was my mind state when the following scenario happened. We were well into doing Arcanum. I want to say we were just a few months from its shipping, and it had been designed so that everything cost an increasing number of points, whether it was attributes or skills or spells or tech degrees. The first one cost a few points, the next one cost more, the next one cost even more, and it went up so that the highest one in each one cost a lot of points. For example, I remember spells went one, three, five, seven, nine. So, there are five spells in each college. That's how much they cost. So, the first one was a point, the next one was three points, then five, then seven, then nine. This meant that to buy all these spells in one college would cost you 25 points. Now, keep in mind, I don't think you ever got more than five points when you went up a level. So, the first three colleges, or spells in a college, you could buy, but after that, you had to save your points. This was true for tech degrees. It's what you do for everything else.

Well, people didn't like that. We heard back from QA that they didn't like having things they wanted to buy but they couldn't. They felt uncomfortable when they were left over points, so they often felt the need to spend those points on low-level things, and then again, they'd go up a level, and they still couldn't afford what they wanted to buy. And I'm not exaggerating when I'm telling you that the entire Arcanum team wanted to change. Now, remember, there were only 14 people at Troika on this, although we did hear from Sierra QA that they also didn't like that hierarchy of points. But let's just talk about Troika because these people I saw every day. Every single person at Troika told me I should switch it to one point. So that's 13 people of the 14. I was the lone outlier.

And I tried to explain to them, "Hey, well, if we do this, now it only costs five points to get every spot on a college." And they're like, "Well, put prerequisites on it." I'm like, "But no matter what prerequisites I put on it, whether I put a skill prerequisite or an attribute or even a level, anything but level, it's trivial for you to get because everything costs one point, and the level, you get there eventually." So even though I thought, "There's no way for you to be able to buy all these, you can't become a specialist in all the colleges because they just cost so many points to specialize," now, once you hit a certain level and you up some skills, which you could do because everything only costs a point, boom, you can now become a specialist in a ton of colleges.

This is what I call the one point fiasco. So, against my better judgment, I changed this. And as bugs started rolling in, I put minimum attributes, minimum skills, minimum level as prerequisites on things to try to stop this. Keep in mind, this was all at the end where, as happened with Fallout, people go, "I can't believe you shipped with certain bugs." And I tried to explain, "You know, I was trying to find a crash bug, a random... You could be doing anything, it seems, and the game would suddenly just crash to desktop." So, you have priorities. That's why games ship with bugs because you have priorities of things to look for, and not everything's a 100% priority, not everything can be.

So, while I wanted to get back to this, other things started taking priority: crashes, save game corruptions, even worse, like things not animating correctly, quests that couldn't be finished. Things were a lot more priority than, "Hey, I made a character who, you know, specialized in seven of the spell colleges." So, what ended up happening is we shipped an unbalanced disaster. Not just, I know most of you think, "Well, what about that harm spell?" Yeah, that's a perfect example. At some point, I was supposed to do a balance pass on all the spells, and I literally never got to it because it was never a high enough priority versus everything else I was doing. And by the time Arcanum shipped, we were back to seven-day workweeks at 14-hour days. So, if you think there was like a minute I could slide that in there, there just literally wasn't a minute. And I know that's funny, people go, "Oh

, look at that, he's got an excuse." It's really an explanation, and sometimes I wish people could understand the difference. I know it was a problem. I wish it wasn't there.

So, we shipped it. We started getting feedback about how bad it was. And I kid you not, one of those 13 people came to me a couple of months after we shipped, and he looked me right in all seriousness. He said, "You never should have switched everything to one point." And I was like, "You hypocrite. You were one of the people who convinced me. You shouldn't listen to me." "You shouldn't listen to me."

So, if you remember something I said in a previous video, just was it yesterday, a couple of days ago, where I said, "Success has many fathers, but failure is an orphan," this is something you need to understand if you ever accept a lead or director role. If something's a good idea, you should, and people expect you to, and get mad if you don't, spread the credit around. But if something's a bad idea, you just have to take it. You just have to go, "Yep, bad idea." And there's a reason for this. If you do blame people for some of the ideas that they convince you to do, they just don't want to work with you again. And these can be really good people. You know, it's like, "Oh, I wish you would just have stuck to art and not thought about design." But also, it can happen from above. You can have people who literally, responsible for your paycheck, whether they're in the hierarchy above you or they're from the publisher, who literally demand certain things going into the game, like, I don't know, an unskippable tutorial intro. You can't say no, but if you think anyone of them is going to step up after the game ships and that feature is panned and go, "Yeah, sorry, that was me." No, they're not going to do that. They will not have your back. And if you refuse to do this, one of two things will happen. Either you get away with it, but then you find you won't be in a put in, kept in a position of authority later, which has happened, or you find publishers just don't want to give you money because you don't listen, you're not a team player. Both of those things have happened. And it leads to these situations where stuff goes into the game that you just have to grit your teeth, people say they hate, and you're like, "Um..." I mean, there are things that if people thought about it, there was no way you even possibly could have been held... Well, you can always be held responsible, but you couldn't possibly have known. If you think a game director looks at every single inventory icon, there are thousands. If you think a game director looks at every line of code, there are tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of lines. They don't. But if they ship a game that crashes a lot, you can guarantee that director is going to hear a lot about it, especially from the people above them.

Now, I even said on the Fallout video that I wasn't gonna name names to people above me for particular bugs. There's always going to be bugs. But that success has many fathers, and failure is an orphan, something is something you really need to think about if you ever want to be a lead or director because you will be held responsible for everything bad, but people don't really want to give you credit for anything good. So, the previous videos I had about the challenges facing programmers or designers or artists, those affect the leads doubly so. And the director, he's held responsible for all of those areas and audio and QA and a lot of things that are publishing's decisions. So, these things you want to keep in mind before you ever accept one of those roles, which is why a long time ago when I mentioned working with these quiet powerhouses, these people who are just brilliant, but they stay in positions where they're not leads, I sometimes think that they had the right idea all along. That yes, they avoided the fame, but they also avoided a lot of the blame, and because of that, they just had a very, very happy career. And I can tell you, I was happy in my role as like a senior programmer or senior designer because you get to do a lot of stuff. But ultimately, you know, most of the credit and blame is going to go to the person above you, which is why I found it very annoying when people who were very new to a project wanted their idea, almost demanded their ideas done, knowing maybe they didn't know, but you knew that if this idea was a good one, they would jump up and take credit for it, but if it was a bad one, they would just sit there, they wouldn't do anything, and you'd be held responsible. And that one point thing for Arcanum, I've sat on for 25 years because I hated it. I hated it.

But it came up in my discussion with this director because I wanted to point to and say, "Look, here's my answer if you're a director, how you should make decisions. You've delegated a lot of authority to your leads and to a lot of your seniors. Talk to them, get their opinion on things, weigh this with your own experience, and it's experience beyond just making games because at one point, you're going to be the first time you make a game or the first time you're lead on a game. Hopefully, you have experience in related things like tabletop games and card games. And like I said, you know, I learned about a lot about level design just by wandering around Disneyland with an open eye and educated eyes, you know, people who worked on theme parks told me things about their design. But ultimately, you have to go with your gut. And I know that sounds antithetical to all of you delegated authority, and you have a lot of experience that can guide you, but ultimately, you have to decide with your gut. I just feel this is the right way to go. Usually, your experience and your leads will guide you in the right direction or at least in the space where there's not a particularly bad choice in the space you're deciding from, but not always. And there are a few times I've been led to a very bad decision, and sure enough, everybody's backed away and let me hang. And that is what's going to happen if you choose to be in a leader direct role. You have the ultimate decision, and people will want you to do what they want to do, knowing that ultimately, they're not going to be held responsible for it. So, that's something for you to think of if you ever want to lead or direct a role or anything, a high-level role in a game. You may not want to do that. You may just want to stick to being a senior for your career, and that's a good choice. But that whole one-point thing with Arcanum has always bugged me because looking back on it, I told that director with all honesty, "I'm not sure I could have made another choice. I'm not sure I could have looked at 

13 people that I worked day in and day out with for years on this project and said, 'Every single one of you is wrong, and I'm right.' I just don't think I ever could have done that, even though every fiber of my being, every experience I had in tabletop and other video games was telling me this is a bad decision. There was that little part of me went, 'Remember, you and you wanted the party at the end of Fallout.' So, that's the best answer I can come up with. Use your gut to be guided by your experience but ultimately go with your gut."
Title:
The "Best" OS For Game Development

Youtube Link:
https://youtu.be/3z-Ewv1ctf0?si=oErR4uDdOEcAaEEx

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim, and today I want to talk about the best operating system to make games for. Now, this is an answer to the question that Romo bomb asked, which is "Hey Tim, can you please talk about the best OS to use in your experience for programming and designing? Does it even matter for the user in those professional grounds?" Yes, but I'm not going to talk about what I think the best one is to be doing that work in because that's subjective. Some people like macOS, some people like Windows, some people like Linux, and there's a million OSes out there. I'm going to answer in terms of pure practicality. In other words, what should you know how to program in to make games? And that is Windows.

The short of it is, if you know Windows programming, that gets you access to the PC market and the similar Xbox Market, which is a big chunk of the market and has been for decades. All you have to really do is additionally learn PlayStation and you've got most of the market right there. Now, that also presupposes that you're going to learn some type of C language, so you can know C++ and C, but I'm only going to talk about OSs now.

You did say in my experience, so let me walk you through all the OSs I've used and why they didn't make the cut. So, way back in the late '70s, I started on the Atari. I couldn't remember what the name of the OS was, so I looked it up and Wikipedia listed it as "default OS." I don't think they called it anything, it was just, or they called it DOS, which is weird because that became what the IBM one was called. But under Wikipedia, or under the Atari, I learned under their OS to program BASIC and assembly, and that let me do a lot of stuff right there. I basically did things in BASIC except for the things that had to be in assembly, either because that was the only way to access it, or if you really needed speed. Assembly, their play missile graphics were a good example of you really want to do that in assembly.

Then very shortly after that, I jumped into DOS because I got a job at a game company when I was 16, and I was doing tools for them on the Atari, but they were going to make a game, which turned out to be Grandam bridge on the PC under DOS. So I quickly learned DOS. We made Grandam Bridge under DOS, and this is where I learned an interesting thing about DOS. You can do anything you want, but you have to do everything. Everything you want, you have to do the things you don't want to do. Basically, it doesn't really give you much. Oh, you want a pop-up window? Code everything about that from scratch. Oh, you want a new font? Do it by hand. It's an interesting thing that DOS was so basic, basically it's a very thin layer over just what the chips on that motherboard provide to you. Very thin layer, so you have to do everything.

I went off to college while I was working on Grandin bridge, and the college I went to, University of Virginia, used an OS called Prime OS, P R I M O S. Looks like Primos the band, or Primus or whatever, but it's pronounced Primos, and it was on their Prime computers. So, while I was in college, this was in the mid-'80s, I learned a lot of different flavors of Unix, which is what Primos was kind of like. It was also a weird mixture of DOS and Unix, but it was more like Unix. And we used those, they were basically microcomputers hooked up to a mainframe because I was at an engineering school, with getting a computer science degree. In addition to learning all the hardware stuff, they tried to teach us a wide variety of languages. So, in addition to C, which I already knew, in fact, I could tell a whole story about something that happened to me in a class there. I'll save that for another video. I also learned Pascal, which I had already kind of learned in high school from the one computer science class my high school taught. We also learned Prologue, Snowball, Fortran, Lisp, just a wide array of languages. And that's where we learn different languages for different purposes. You going to do a lot of string processing? Snowball. You want to do a lot of scientific calculations? Fortran. So different languages supported different things.

When I went on to grad school, straight from college, I went to grad school in California at University of California, Irvine, in the late '80s, early '90s, they were all Unix. Now, it wasn't that big of a jump for me because I'd been using Primos, which was a kind of a Unix flavor, but they used real Unix. I loved it. Unix provided so many cool accessors to functionality in the OS, and it was really fun. It really supported my hacky flavors. I would do fun things like send messages to my friends and have it look like one of them. I sent them a message from God in heaven, and he replied, Satan from hell. It was funny things you could do. But one thing I really loved about it was it had features that you still don't see in a lot of modern OS's. One of them, I'll give you a quick example, how it handled files and directories. So, a directory was just a collection of files, but files weren't just "Here's a bunch of data. Oh, and we're going to label it." What files did is they pointed to what was called an internal node, an inode, and the inode contained all the information about "Here's the file. Here's all the sectors that store the data. Here's how they link together." The reason that was important was you could have two files in two different directories that pointed to the same inode, so they pointed to the same file. Which means you open one of them and edit it, close it, when you open the other one, it's got the edits. It was like a, it's like Windows, what do they call it, a shortcut. But it's not the same because both of those files are really the file. And what I mean by that is edit either of them, the file gets changed. If you delete one, the other one remains. Basically, the inode knows everybody who's pointing to it, and as long as that number is greater than one, it doesn't delete the file. So, if you want that file really deleted, you have to go to all the places that have that file as an inode and delete those files. What it meant was, you could have, let's say, you wanted to store a picture. This is something that I really wish Windows did. Let's say I had a picture, a family photo. I want to store that under "Cane family," but since all my siblings are in it, I would also love that photo stored under all five siblings. Under Windows, I would have to make six copies of that photo, one for the thec folder and then one for each sibling folder, or use shortcuts. But the shortcuts aren't really the file. What I love about

 how Unix would handle it is, it would, there would be six files of that photo, but they're all the same photo. Edit one, they're all edited. They're all edited. Try to delete, delete it from one folder, it's not deleted from the others. It's just a really nice way of thinking of files, and it's how I thought of files. And then when I'd go back to DOS or Windows, I'd be like, "Uh." By the way, speaking of back to DOS, when I went to work at Interplay in the early '90s, back to DOS, I was at Interplay pre-Windows. And one of the things I did was when I wrote Ganol, and I've got a whole video about Ganol, I made a wrapper for all the stuff I wanted to do in DOS, including some things that I built on top of DOS, like popup windows and things. And then I just said, "That's Ganol. I'm going to code for Ganol." So, someone else could write the Windows version, and someone did. And someone else could write the Mac version, and someone did. But we were just coding Fallout in Ganol, and it worked on all those other ones. And I really like that. Also, a lot of our, the early computers that Interplay bought to do rendering on were Sun computers, and they ran IRIX, which was a very, very strongly flavored version of Unix. And I knew Unix, so I was often brought in when the 3D pro artists had a problem, like, "Hey, I can't get this to work," or "I'm shut out of my account," or whatever. I would go in and fix that. So, while I was coding technically for DOS and Windows, I was doing my own stuff for Ganol and occasionally going in and do Unix stuff.

Now, why did I make all that Ganol stuff? Because Windows ain't great. I'm not going to sit here and defend Windows. Sometimes it's really hard to use, and it's really hard to code for. But I will tell you, two nice things about it: Like DOS, if you can conceive of what you want to do, you can probably do it under Windows. And tons of backward compatibility. I'm still playing games from 30 years ago on Windows. I can't do that with Apple. Let me talk about that. I only made one game for the Apple, and that was Fallout. And I really didn't make it for that. I made it for Ganol, and Ganol had a Mac OS version. The reason for that is, in my career, I haven't seen that Apple really cares in any way about games. They're there. They recognize them. They occasionally make a half-hearted effort, like Game Sprockets, which then disappears, but they don't really care about them. It's not, it's not... I can't see that being part of a board meeting, going "How do we expand our game stuff?" Yeah, because of iPhone, there's a lot of Apple games now, but I don't think they care about that. And one of the problems is, everything has to be done Apple's way, and if you don't do it their way, screw you. Sometimes you can't even do it. When we made Fallout, we had to process art files, and we had thousands of them. And they were processed separately for DOS, Windows, and PC, although I think DOS and Windows were processed the same, and then they were processed separately for Mac. Well, guess what? For Windows, we wrote a simple batch file that simply said, "Grab, go to this folder, grab star dot whatever the extension was for the art files, and process them through this other application that had a console command version." Whoa. Doing that on the Mac was a pain in the butt. I think we needed to do a third-party batch file system and find something that accepted commands being given to it. The biggest thing I remember was, in this is in the mid-'90s, you couldn't rope. If you wanted to collect a bunch of files, you had to rope them, you know, where you slid the mouse over it and grabbed them all. It wouldn't rope thousands. It stopped after I think 256, so you had to rope them in chunks, even from the same directory. The Mac guy started complaining that we had a thousand folders in one directory, and I said, "They all belong there. They're all one thing. These are all the art files associated for a map." And he was like, "You shouldn't put more than 26." I'm like, "That was, by the way, just the very beginning of Apple people love to tell you, if it's not something Apple supports, that you're doing it wrong." And it's a weird thing. My first iPhone couldn't send a text to multiple recipients. A friend of mine who's a big Apple guy told me that wasn't a big deal, even though he was on my weekly dinner text that I sent out in the evening going, "Hey, where are we going to go eat?" And I couldn't send those. There were like 12 people on that. He said, "Well, send them individually." And I'm like, "And when one person responds, 'Hey, I don't want to do pizza this week. Can we switch to, you know, Chinese or something?'" And I'm like, "I'm not sending 12 messages out." And when one person has a change, taking that and resending it out to 12. I said, "I'd rather just not be in charge of this anymore." And it was stupid, because Android did support that from the very beginning. It was a weird... It's a weird fanaticism, and it just drives me bonkers.

Anyway, that fall, after Fallout, I didn't do anything on Apple anymore. So, I don't really know what it's like to code on there. I know people like using it, and I get why they do. It's a very consistent interface. It's very easy to use, easier than Windows. But I think, what I can tell you, I will sum up after four decades: Windows. It's just one. I used it the most in my career. It still is probably what I would use the most. It has the most games for it, especially if you include Xbox. If I was going to pick a runner-up, it still wouldn't be macOS. It would probably be Unix or some flavor of it, Linux or something like that. It's what's in the Steam Deck. You can run Windows games under Linux. And so, I'd probably pick that as my runner-up. But right now, if you want to be a programmer and you want the most options on where to work and what games to work on, I think you got to go Windows as your OS. I'm sure people will disagree. I'd love to hear the reasons why, but those are my reasons why. And anyway, I hope this answered your question, Romo bomb.

The Biggest Influences On Fallout.md

https://youtu.be/Q8XTWJRBFeM?si=wZVfgkUcHrj14bTD

Hi, it's me, Tim. Today, I want to talk about what influenced the creation of Fallout. Now, I've already talked about, in fact, I have a whole video about the influences on the music, and I'm going to link that in the description. What I really want to talk about now is the game itself: the setting, the story, individual elements.

I've decided to kind of do it backwards. I thought about this a few times, and I was going to do the general influences and then talk about the specific. Instead, what I'm going to do is talk about the specific influences, going through elements of the game, and tell you what influenced us, and then I'll list games, movies, and books that had a more general influence. That there was no one particular thing we can point to and say, "yeah, that's from that movie or book."

So, I will start with companies. So, Vault-Tec, which plays a big role in Fallout and all the subsequent games, it was a stereotype of every greedy, poorly managed defense contractor that flourished in the United States during the Cold War and after. The US still has one of the biggest defense budgets in the world. I think it's bigger than the next two or three combined, so it still exists today. So, I think we all see a little Vault-Tec in all these defense companies. We just wanted to make fun of those.

General Atomics, that actually specifically came from Robert Heinlein and the short stories he wrote. Many of them had a reference to a company called General Atomics, which just sort of did a little bit of everything. We also had RobCo, which was just a parody of Ronco, the company that made the Popeil Pocket Fisherman and the hair spray that he made that hid your bald spot, and in Futurama, he was the guy who invented heads in jars.

I like where this went later, where it became House, who was the guy who started RobCo, but it just started as a parody of Ronco. Some of the products we had, like Sugar Bombs, were based on Calvin and Hobbes because Calvin's favorite cereal was chocolate-frosted sugar bombs. Sugar Bombs just had to be in a game about a post-nuclear war. Nuka-Cola, I think it's obvious this came from Coca-Cola, back from when it really contained cocaine, so who knows what's in Nuka-Cola. We just thought it was funny. I honestly don't remember if that was a Scott Campbell or a Chris Taylor invention, but it was a good one.

Our robots were primarily inspired by things like Forbidden Planet. You mentioned that movie before. Its robot, Robbie, which was used in a ton of other movies as well, was a touchstone for a lot of our robot designs. I remember specifically telling our designers that anything new, like a Terminator or RoboCop style design, would be denied, would be rejected. Still had someone who tried to do that. It got rejected. I guess now, though, with, since I guess any kind of android is now fair game for Fallout.

For advertisements, I know our artists looked at Cold War-era posters and they also looked at comic books, especially the front covers, for just how people posed and how monsters were coming at them vaguely in the background. Our weapons and armor were modeled after a lot of real-world guns, but that was for the regular guns. For the lasers and plasma weapons, we looked at everything from old Flash Gordon movies and serials to things like Blade Runner. And I think you can, if you look at the images, especially the inventory images, you can see that influence.

For Power Armor, what happened, we needed a high-end armor, and Leonard had made one, but as he talked about in one of the chats later on, when he needed something that was more detailed to show in cinematics, that's when he made the power armor that's on the cover and in the cinematics and subsequently in the game. I know parts of it came from City of Lost Children, you know, the helmet eyepiece. You can see that in the movie City of Lost Children, in one of the characters. The tubing and vents were inspired by movies like that. The whole look of tech in City of Lost Children was very inspirational to a lot of our artists, and so our computers and some other gear, I think, also were influenced by that movie.

Our radiation effects, Chris Taylor wrote the section on nuclear blast effects in the manual, and I know he used an outside source. I don't remember what it was. I think it was something Kurt Decker, one of the programmers, I think he found it. Let's say he found it in the trash, but I don't know where it came from. I know we referenced movies like Them, with the '50s movie with giant ants, as what we wanted radiation to do in our game, so it made giant animals like the rad scorpion. There were a lot of '50s movies that had just giant versions of regular creatures caused by radiation and to punish mankind for having hubris. That was stuff we wanted to do.

Now, when we get to ghouls, we always disagreed on that. I thought they were from radiation. Other designers wanted them to be a combination of radiation, FEV. I kind of thought, no, let's let the mutants be FEV, and the ghouls were just radiation. That led to the whole idea, though, of why did the Master dwellers because they didn't have any radiation damage, because the more radiation damage you had, the more likely FEV would turn you into a dumb super mutant rather than somebody like the lieutenant. So, we had some lore going on there.

We also had, we put high radiation areas in the game. The Glow was one of them you had to go to. We used to say that's where things like glowing ghouls came from. They just had to absorb so much radiation that they were re-emitting it. I know we thought of a lot of the George Romero movies for the feral zombies, that they were just like what he called walkers.

The radiation suits were based on things we saw in movies like Three Mile Island, which was about the disaster at the nuclear power plant. For the effects in the game, I had already made a drug effect system, and we kind of generalized radiation off of that.

Let's see, the war, we talked about we needed a big scary evil communist state since we were basing Fallout on being capitalistic. Russia had already declined so much in the '80s that we went with China because it fit the bill. The movie Red Dawn was inspirational about the US being invaded, except we just used China instead of Russia. I know the movie War Games had displays that showed the coastal US being nuked and Russian subs off the coast, so we were like, hey, let's have Chinese subs. The movie On the Beach also showed a US sub reaching Australia after a nuclear war, so that got us thinking about things like that.

FEV, not really sure who created it. I've had multiple people on the team tell me they created it. So, okay. I actually thought the idea was mine. I can tell you that the quadruple helix idea, when you actually read the biology reports on FEV, I wrote those

 reports. I researched like vibrions and stuff. I remember a German microbiologist emailed us and said, hey, you were spot on on that, and I'm like, yeah. But the idea for that came from a novel called "Elise," which was about a woman who was immortal because she was born with quadruple DNA.

Our vehicles, the idea from the wrecked ones, Road Warrior was on continuous loop in Leonard and Jason's office, and they had a lot of, they really loved vehicles, and the prices, and all those things. I'm sure came from that. The Vertibirds, though, not the look, but the name, came from a very popular toy that I owned in the '70s, which was a helicopter on a rod, and you can just basically fly it in circles and try to pick up other toys. The Brotherhood of Steel, talked about that a lot, came from "A Canticle for Leibowitz." The Enclave kind of came out of the idea that because there weren't enough vaults to hold everybody, we needed a bad guy who was controlling them and using them as experiments, and that's where the Enclave came from.

Dogmeat, Dogmeat has two different people who can claim origin, and I will explain exactly why. We had dogs in the game. We had discounted companions, but Jason Anderson really wanted them, thought it could be done, convinced Jess Henig, the scripter, to make Dogmeat into a companion, and he did. That was the first companion we made for the game. The name Dogmeat, though, came from Scott Bennie. He thought that was the perfect name. I think it was the name of the dog in Road Warrior, but it might have been A Boy and His Dog. Both influenced our game.

The building design were old Art Deco designs that Leonard loved, so that's why they're big heads on things. The GECK, as we talked about in the chat, we never talked about that during 99% of the development of Fallout, and then when the manual was being done, we had a blank page on the end, and Leonard and Jason put their heads together, and next thing I know, literally a day later or two days later, they had a complete advertisement for this GECK, and it was thrown in the end of the manual and then became the launching point for the storyline for Fallout 2.

Now, the master was a completely original idea, and I'm not sure who it came from. I just remember us talking about the FEV vats and how someone had fallen in accidentally, and someone said, what was it, man, was it a woman, was it a robot, and someone else jokingly said, what about all three? The master was born. Personally, I think he's a scary, original, cool villain. I was glad to see he made the top of several top villains in RPG lists.

Okay, those are all the specific design elements that I can tie into a specific inspiration. For the books, I've already mentioned "A Canticle for Leibowitz" and the book "I Am Legend," which is what Omega Man and the movie I Am Legend were based on. I should also point out that starting around '92, I had a printout of all the sci-fi novels that had won a Hugo, not a Nebula, a Hugo, and I wanted to read all of them. I realized I had read a lot of them, but I wanted to read all of them, and Chris Taylor started doing it too. And even though I had read more than he had, Chris can speed read, so he would often leave in the evening and come in the morning and go, oh, I read "A Fire Upon the Deep" last night, which is a thick book, and he wanted to talk about it. I'm like, this is so unfair. I don't speed read. I mean, if I read as fast as I could, I could luckily get through a book in a week. So, Chris rapidly outpaced me, but we read all the Hugo winners, and so I'm sure there are some subconscious influences that came from those books.

For the movies, I've already mentioned a lot of them. I should also mention the TV miniseries "The Day After," which came out in the '80s. That depiction of what life would be in America after a nuclear war, it resonated with a lot of us. "Mad Max" and "Road Warrior," of course. "City of Lost Children," "Forbidden Planet," I've mentioned those. "On the Beach," "Dr. Strangelove," gotta mention that. "A Boy and His Dog," and also the French movie "La Jetée," which is what eventually got turned into years later into "12 Monkeys." But "La Jetée" influenced us a great deal. It's about a guy using time travel to go back and try to avoid some nuclear war that had happened. Very interesting movie. I recommend you watch it. It's not a typical movie. It's mostly still images.

And then for games, there were a lot of influences on games. Tabletop, gotta mention "Gamma World." That was obviously an influence, so was GURPS, of course. "Wiz-War" was a tabletop game we played where you play wizards trying to collect treasures. That game fascinated us. We played it all the time. We made new cards for it. And I think what it was is because everybody's wizard, we're all playing wizards, but you got handed a deck, a hand of cards. That meant people were playing wildly differently. And you could win by getting two treasures on your home square, but you only carry one at a time, which meant you'd carry one to your home square, you go off to get the other one, and people will just steal the one from your home square. But there was another way to win, which is to be the last person alive. So, some people just became, you know, psychotic serial killer wizards and just attacked all the other wizards. It was interesting to watch because sometimes where they were fighting, someone else, you'd see someone just go pick up a treasure, drop it, go get another treasure, drop it, and they won quietly off to one side while all the wizards were fighting on the other side of the board. And that reactive part of my brain went, I love this.

For computer games, "XCOM," wildly influential on our combat. "Crusader: No Remorse" and "I Am a New Regret," we played those. That was an isometric game. We loved playing it. We loved the look of it. The "Ultima" series, hugely influential on me and a lot of the other designers. And I've talked to Richard Garriott about this, its use of the player trying being an avatar and being good was a strong thing for me to react to and go, I want the player not to have to be good. So, "Ultima" made me go, I love this, but I don't want to do this.

And then, of course, "Wasteland." And I will clarify something Leonard brought up. So, on the whole team, "Wasteland" was an influence, but not as strong as a lot of people think it was. There

 were people on our team who had never played it, there are people on our team who played it and didn't like it, there are a lot of people on our team who played it and did like it. I can tell you the biggest influence, other than the whole idea of a post-apocalyptic world and things like Rangers, was the idea that there could be quests that have a moral dilemma in them. And the one I talk about a lot is when you start the game, and a little boy asks you to go rescue his dog, I think he was wandered into a cave, you go in there, and the dog is rabid. There's basically no way you can run away, but there's really no way to rescue the dog. Most people end up killing it, and then you go back to the kid, and I think you can tell them the truth, or you can lie, and you can tell you the dog is already dead, or you couldn't find the dog. But that stuck with me as a post-apocalypse world provides has quests that provide moral dilemmas that aren't necessarily resolvable always in the best way. Sometimes the best solution, they're still kind of... uh, that stuck with me, and I wanted things like that in "Fallout" as part of our multiple solutions.

So, "Wasteland" was an influence, just probably not as heavy an influence as people make it out to be. And just to be clear, we were never making "Wasteland 2." We were making our own thing, while Brian Fargo and Dick Laerberg said they were trying, I mean, they were trying to get the license for "Wasteland 2," which would have had made us go back and change some things, but we never actually, that wasn't a consideration in our daily design meetings. We just went, okay, if that happens, we'll make some changes, but we were making our own thing, and "Fallout" kind of took on a life of its own once Leonard had that inspirational, "let's make it the way the '50s were." There was really no going back. There were things that I would have massively regretted changing to make us more like "Wasteland" once that idea had been realized and instantiated in the game.

So, that's most of it. That's all the influences I could think of. I went down a lot of elements of the game and then just some stuff that was general. I think between that and the music video, the video I made about the musical "Fallout," I think that's every influence I can, I've ever been told or can think of. So, I hope that answers a lot of questions about what influenced the making of "Fallout."

The Decline Of Generalists.md
Youtube Link:
https://youtu.be/_ihX2e9dnYM?si=XUjoDloTnIa7__0q

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim, and today I want to talk about the decline of generalists. I'll describe what that is, but I've gotten a lot of questions from people who say what's changed the most in development over the last 40 years. And I've thought about this a lot because there's so much that's changed. I mean, the nature of games have changed, the hardware's changed, the structure of companies have changed, the money involved has massively changed, the diversity in the industry has changed. Just pretty much everything about the industry is wildly different. So, this is something that's very peculiar and specific to the game industry that a lot of people outside the game industry would probably have no idea is even happening. So, I'll have to talk about what I mean by generalist, why they're in decline, and the problems I think that introduces.

So first of all, what do I mean by generalist? A generalist is someone who's skilled in multiple disciplines. There's a bunch of roles that come together to make a video game, and I've talked about it: there are programmers and designers and artists and producers and sound people and the marketing and sales and admin and all the things that go to putting a game together. And all of these... what used to be just a game designer now it's like, well, are you system, are you narrative, are you level? Programmers, are you gameplay, are you UI, are you network, are you graphics? Even, you know, when it gets into things like... you know, we used to have a sound guy, and he'd do your music and your sound effects and your UI elements. Now those often are individual people who specialize in that area.

So, generalist, the multi-disciplinarians... it's like when you work with someone who's an artist but he also writes for the game, or a programmer who also designs, or a producer who's coded. Now, let me just say what's happened to them. And when I say the decline of generalists, what I'm talking about is not that the quality of generalists have gone down but literally the number of generalists, and because the number has declined, the percentage of generalists has gone way, way down as the industry's gotten bigger because the industry's gotten a lot bigger with people, but most of them are specialists. I have met very few narrative designers who do anything but write. I've met people who work in UX, and that's all they do. They make UIs, they do the whole user experience, but ask them their opinion on a system mechanic or a piece of non-UI art, and there's nothing there.

So I understand why the rise of specialists have occurred. The industry is much, much bigger, teams are much, much bigger, development is longer, the detail that people expect is so much higher. It's called fidelity. The fidelity on games is through the roof compared to what they were in the '70s and '80s. And to create that level of detail people expect, whether it's graphical, system depth, even the frame rate, you need specialists. You need people who do nothing but work in that area to tune it to a really high level where in the old days, you'd make a game, you debug it, you do some high-level optimization, you know, and that would result in a game with a decent frame rate, that fit in the space you had, and you shipped it.

Now, art is so much more detailed. Texture resolution, number of polygons per model, the number of UIs that are available... just art alone creates a massive amount of data that has to be processed, and then that spills out to programmers and designers, sound people, production, everybody has to deal with this huge sheer amount of data. And then that's just a fraction of what programmers are dealing with. Systems are in huge detail. So it made sense that programmers got broken up, that you're going to handle system mechanics, you're going to handle UI, you're going to handle graphics, you're going to handle networking. It has to... I've even seen worked on teams where we had one or two game engine specialists. So if we're making an Unreal game, there was somebody who's like, "I'm really good at Unreal." I can figure out... every engine I've used has had quirks. I'm not picking on Unreal, Unity had quirks, my own game engines had quirks. I know you find that hard to believe. So usually, there was a specialist who was like, "Oh, I know why the engine's doing that. I'll take care of it."

So, I understand why there are so many specialists, but let me tell you why generalists were so great and still are great, and while I'm lamenting the fact that they are in decline. Let me talk about some of the great generalists I've worked with. I've worked with programmer generalists who didn't specialize in any particular subspecialty within programming. They're just generalist programmers. Those are great programmers. We can... they can link different systems together. So, your UX needs sound. Well, this guy's great at that. Your, um, you need to make a particular kind of UI for when you're doing the multiplayer section of your code, you know, for making a lobby for um, looking for players, for letting people know when their friends are also logged in to this multiplayer game. It's great when you have those meetings. It's great to have one of those generals there who's both interested in, actually, he's both interested in the UX experience but he knows how the network code works, so he knows how you have to set up those interfaces. Sometimes you can do those in a group, you know, and have a meeting where all the different people, all the different specialists are there, but let me just tell you, when you have one person who knows all the disciplines, it makes all the difference.

Um, having a programmer who knows very in very detailed ways how the art is put together, that is a great programmer for speeding up the loading of the art, for doing things like blending props into terrain, for putting together your particle effect system. That's the guy I want doing it. If you have a programmer who knows the sound code inside and out and talks to musicians, maybe plays their own instruments, or can just talk to musicians in their own language, I want her doing this because a lot of the other programmers will be like, "Look, I hooked up Wwise for you, what more do you want from me?" But actually having a programmer in there that goes, "Oh yeah, I know what you're looking for. You want controls exposed for these things. You want to be able to blend and music together in more than just a crossfade." Once you find a programmer like that who speaks to the sound people in their language, it's great.

Where I especially love generalists is in tools. When you make tools for your game, and some games are only as good as their tools, no one makes tools better than generalists because these are the programmers who know what the artist is trying to do, know what the musician is trying to do, know what the level designer is trying to do, and they make tools that expose those controls in clear, easy ways to

 use. So, you know, if there's one big lament I have, it's the decline in generalists is the decline in tool quality.

Now, there are other people besides programmers that get better if they know code. If a designer, an artist knows code, they can ask for things they want, they can ask for the features they want very specifically. It's... it involves less vague generalizations, and they can go, "Oh, I would like to be able to do this. I would like to be able to do this with my animations. I would like to be able to do this with my music. Can you make a tool that lets me do this?" It also lets them, just by knowing how the underlying code works, designers and artists understand and can work around limitations in the engine, and every engine has limitation, everything does. Knowing those and working around them makes those particular designers and artists so much more wonderful to work with than ones that are constantly butting up against the limitations and demanding them to be removed because at some point you have to say no, and then those people are like, "I can't work under these conditions."

But let me tell you, I've worked with producers who understand code and art and design. They're much better communicators, which is what you want in every producer. They're also really good at spotting critical paths and schedules. They will look at a schedule and go, "Oh, I notice you're putting together a bunch of animations here, but did you see that your models won't be ready yet? They can do the animation without the textures being ready, but they're going to need those models to be done and they need to be rigged with skeletons before you do the animation." And they just, they just see that in a schedule, and they're like, "Oh, we've got to rearrange that." That is wonderful. That is wonderful if you have a producer who knows how to do that.

So, in previous videos, I know I've mentioned the term force multiplier. I had a producer who loved that term; he used that a lot. Um, he called me a force multiplier. I called Jason Taylor, who I did a chat with on his work on Fallout, I called him a force multiplier. Force multipliers are people who, by their very existence in the team, seem to improve the productivity of everyone around them. Almost every force multiplier that I know and have worked with has been a generalist, and the way they did their force multiplication is, they would hear two people talking past each other and step in and facilitate whatever they're talking about. They would notice something in the game and go, "Oh, I see someone trying to do this. I'm going to expose this to make it easier," or they would just, you know, look at a tool and go, "You know, this tool would be a lot better if it worked this way." Every one of those people were invaluable to the games I worked on.

So now, I'm sad that generalists are declining. I understand why almost everybody wants to be a specialist. It's easy to be a specialist. You dive deep on one thing, you become known for that thing. Some specialists can command a really high salary for knowing that thing, especially if that thing is complicated or there aren't a lot of other specialists. But, I'm sad to see generalists disappearing because I see what games are lacking because the generals aren't there. I see tools that aren't as good as they could be. I see developers talking past each other. I see games that are designed where individual elements were kind of made in a vacuum, and then when you're playing, you're like, "I love this feature, but I never use it." It just doesn't... it's fun to do this thing, but I never really need to do this in combat, or I never really need to craft or build this thing. It just... it doesn't matter in the game because it was made by someone who was very passionate and knew how to put it in, but there was no one who connected it to other things.

So, I see this happening in a lot of games. I've seen generalist decline, especially in the last 20 years with the rise of specialists. So, I thought I'd mention it. This may be something that a lot of people are on the industry go, "I really have no idea what that video was about," but I'm kind of saying if you know what I'm talking about, you know what I'm talking about, and if you don't know what I'm talking about but you think you want to get in the industry, I'm... I was always on the lookout for a good generalist, and I don't think anyone really sells themselves that way, but I've heard so many people on teams go, "I love working with Bob. I love working with Mary because she knows how to talk my language," and what they're basically saying is that person was a generalist, and I loved working with him.

So those are my thoughts on generalists.

The Evolution Of Flaws.md
Youtube Link:
https://youtu.be/S2-q_kswvwU?si=0gk-V3F74h0sT2wW

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim, and today I want to talk about the evolution of flaws. If you played The Outer Worlds, you know in there, flaws is a system mechanic where as you play the game, it pays attention to things you do and then suggests a flaw. You know, like maybe you're scared of robots, or maybe you take a lot of falling damage a lot, or you're maybe you're afraid of heights cuz you take a lot of falling damage. The idea for that germinated almost 37 years before that game. Let me walk you through this, and I think this is a good parallel to the video I did on why ideas aren't worthwhile because this idea, I mean, came to me when I was a teenager, but it took decades for it to be honed into something that I put into an RPG the way I wanted it to be. So let's talk about that.

So I know I've told these stories. I'm going to kind of repeat them here a little bit just for completeness but back in high school when I was playing D&D, there was a couple of times where low character stats led to really interesting characters. One of them was dumb dialogue, which actually ended up in Fallout, um, over a decade later. That was a character had rolled a three and put it in their intelligence thinking I'm a fighter, that's a dumb stat, and I put a restriction on them that they could only talk in single syllable words, mono syllabically, single syllable words. It was an interesting restriction, watching them play and run around the game world, and I'd always go, okay, you just used two syllables, and it really made them think about what they were going to say, and it made their character sound like you'd expect a three intelligence character to sound, and that was super fun.

And then the other story was, uh, my friend Joel, who made, who wrote, I think a five, he put it in dexterity, which makes you be a cleric, and he played this low dex character, and he played him for years. I think he played him throughout our high school campaign, and his goal was to find gauntlets of dexterity so he could finally have an 18 dex. But what was cool about that was, so here was how this character played, and by the way, when I pointed out to him that when he was surprised, the rule said you don't get your dex adjustment when you're surprised, not bonus adjustment, meaning his dexterity was so low that he was easier to hit, he actually, it made his AC higher, remember in original D&D, high AC is worse, um, which meant when he was surprised, he couldn't jump into a sword or into an arrow. He was too surprised, so when he was surprised, his AC was better. That was an odd realization, it but watching him play this character, knowing that he was frequently going to have a bad initiative, uh, that he could get hit easily, that he had this goal to find a particular magic item, it made that character really memorable, and I remembered that, and it was the first realization I had that players loved anything that made their character unique, and that also they did like overcoming challenges if you put a challenge in the game that was unique to their character, they loved having to do that. There was not this, uh, I'm starting to really regret this low attribute, it was a fun part of their character.

So imagine this was in the 80s, so imagine, I guess it was the late 80s when I discovered GURPS. GURPS was my first skill-based game, so I was used to D&D, which was class-based, um, GURPS was the first time I think I played a skill-based tabletop RPG, and it came with disadvantages, and I remember thinking, why would anyone want a disadvantage? And then when it was explained to me, you get 100 points to make your character, but disadvantages are worth a negative amount, I was like, oh, I want all the disadvantages. I'm going to make a thousand-point character with one leg and one arm and one eye and stuttering and, you know, asthma, and just anything I can think of, and then I found out, oh no, you're only allowed to have minus 40 total, you know, otherwise you'd make an unplayable character, but still, you could make a 140-point character if you took 40 points of disadvantages. I loved it, except for one thing, it always bugged me that I had to pick those disadvantages before the game started, so I'd have to come up with a complete concept of my character, unlike when you're playing the game, and you can gain disadvantages or advantages, and you can also, um, you get skill points. I kind of wish I could say, hey, can I reserve minus 10 points for things I want to add later? I want to while I'm playing decide my character is afraid of monsters or my character is afraid of magic or whatever, but there was nothing in the game to do that. We could have put it as a house rule, but I remember thinking, eh, I'd like to do that.

So that would have been late 80s, early 90s. Jump forward to 2003, and I'm doing Temple of Elemental Evil, and I wanted to put something in that I called the ego page. The ego page was things like what's the most damage you ever did, most monsters you ever killed, most powerful spell you ever threw, things like that. It kept track of things your character did that were kind of memorable, and players really liked it, but one thing I noticed when I read some reviews and some online comments is people really liked the idea that the game was watching them, because they liked my games because they were reactive, but this was hard evidence that the game was watching and tabulating what you did, and people really like that. I was like, hell yeah, I, I'm glad they like being watched because after Temple, starting in the early 2000s, games started coming out with achievements, and achievements weren't quests, and they weren't tasks, it was the game noticing you had done something and just saying, achievement, you fell more than 100 feet, achievement, you just killed 10 monsters. Often you didn't get anything for these, you were just told you achieved it. That alone was rewarding to players, and I was like, wow, they, they like achievements, just being told you did something, and sometimes it was something they already knew they did, they knew they fell. It's like, wow, I, the game knows I fell 100 feet and survived, go me.

Well, achievements meant that a lot of code had to be put into the game to track the player, or a better way of saying that is we had to systemize a method of tracking achievements so that it was an easy to do. You could, at any point in code where you check, you could check that something happened, there' need to be an easy way to throw that in the achievement tracker, so we did that. That still germinated in my head for a while until 2016, and I'm putting together the very early system mechanics for Outer Worlds, and I, I

 think I've mentioned before, every time I do a game, I like to do something new. I like to be able to point at something in the game and going, I don't think you've ever seen that before. It could be a setting, it could be a system mechanic, it could be even an unusual kind of quest or character, but I want to be able to point to and go, I don't think you've seen that before. That's what flaws were for me for Outer Worlds. They were people were quick to go, isn't that like GURPS disadvantages? I'm like, yes and no. It's more like achievements that come with a reward, a of a perk, but it's also like a GURPS disadvantage that you get to buy later after your character's made, but not really because you don't get to pick it, it's picked for you. It's us tracking the player and saying, hey, these things have happened to you, we've seen them, if you agree that this would have this effect on you, which is a penalty, would you accept that and we'll let you pick a new perk? You know, we'll give you a perk point.

So, by the way, the original design was every flaw had five associated perks, and you got to pick which one. For example, if you were afraid of robots, if that, if you had robophobia, the flaws might be the increased adrenaline makes you do more damage, or you have a higher movement speed when you're around robots, or you see, you perceive robots from a greater distance, your perception is treated as plus two because the moment a robot comes into review, you're watching it. I wanted to do those, we ran out of time, but so that's even kind of what I'm saying is, the moral of this, of this whole video is, you can have an idea, it takes a long time for you to find how to express that idea correctly, and even then when you express it, you can probably think, you know, there probably would have been a better way to do that. This is yet another reason I think ideas themselves aren't that worthwhile. It's, it took me a long time to take this idea of a flaw and figure out how to do it in code, how to make it fun for the player, how to make it something they'd want to do, and it came together as a result of a bunch of different things, of seeing GURPS disadvantages, um, seeing how people liked having challenges in my D&D game, seeing that people liked being tracked on the on the Temple of Elemental Evil ego page, and it through achievements, and all that came together to with Outer Worlds flaws, and it was the one idea I think I could track through the evolution of it that clearly, but almost all my ideas work that way. If you saw something in a game of mine that you liked, I probably had the idea much earlier, and it came from one of my books, and it took me a while to figure out how to do it. That's the hard part. So, I hope you like this example of how an idea grows into being. Anyway, thanks.

The Evolution Of Source Control.md
Youtube Link:
https://youtu.be/4J2X9eGHnIU?si=OtWl_9VxB9gvxwA3

Hi everyone, it's me Tim, and today I want to talk about the evolution of source control. Source control is widely used now, was not ever used in the 80s, at least nowhere I was. Source control is using software to maintain ownership of an asset that's going into the game. This asset could be a code module, it could be a piece of art, it could be a script, but source control manages the versions of those and who owns it and what the latest one is.

So let me tell you how we did source control in the 80s and even early 90s. A lot of the games I worked on either had one programmer, which was pretty much BST tail and and Rags to Riches, or on Grand s Bridge, even though there were multiple programmers, there was for any particular code module, there was only one programmer, so you basically owned the code, and whatever was on your machine was the latest version. Builds were made by putting that code onto a build machine. When there was only one programmer, my machine was the build machine. I would get art from artists, I would get sound files, I would get scripts, whatever was happening, I would get them, put them on my machine, and make a build from my machine. For something like Grand s Bridge, I remember giving code to the lead programmer, and he would then build it on his machine. On Rags of Riches, I think was one of the first times we might have had a build machine, I don't remember, but that would be a machine that wasn't one that any particular one on the team used, but everybody went and put their assets on it, whether it was their art or their sound or the code, and it was built there.

I know by the time we started Source Safe, Fallout in 1994, that was the first time we ever used software controlled source management, and that was a piece of software called Source Safe. It was from Microsoft. Source Safe was great because it lived up on the network, and you check things in to Source Safe or check things out. If you added a file, it would go into Source Safe and then become read-only on your machine, so you couldn't touch it. If you wanted to, you could get stuff out of Source Safe, and it would get read-only copies on your own machine. So if I wanted to make a build with the latest version of all the assets, I would just do a get. I would get all the latest versions, and I could do a build on my machine and have a version of the game with all the latest assets and code. If I wanted to make a change to code, I would have to check out that file from Source Safe, and this is everyone would have to, the artist would have to check out an art file, a texture, a scriptor would have to check out a script, an audio person would have to check out a sound file. But Source Safe was exclusive, meaning when you checked it out, it became writable on your machine, and no one else could check it out. It was seen as checked out by you, and if anyone else went to Source Safe to check it out, it would say sorry, and it would say Tim has it right now. So you could sometimes go to someone and go, hey, we need to do a build, and you're sitting on a bunch of files checked out. But the interesting thing about exclusive checkout meant you had to think about how you were doing code because if you had a module that was really big and controlled a lot of parts of the game, multiple programmers might want to get at that, and then they would argue over who had it. So part of how you broke up your code wasn't just how you thought the code should naturally break up into modules but also you wanted the modules to be smaller so that if one programmer grabbed some part of the game, other programmers could still work on other parts. So like your interface, you didn't want one big interface module; you break the interface up to here's the inventory, here's the option screen, here's the main HUD, here's the journal, and you break those all up into different code modules so that different people could work on those interfaces at the same time because the checkouts in Source Safe were exclusive. There's no concept of merging, meaning you got a version from Source Safe, you modified it, and then when you checked it in, it became read-only on your machine, and your new one checked in as the latest. You could have a history, and you could roll back to a previous one, but it was a continuous linear history of changes that individuals made to files, and you could, it would have the name of the person who made the changes, so you could see who had made changes. That's how we sometimes knew when bugs had been introduced because you're like, hey, it's not working, you saw someone check something in, you could Delta the two files and say, oh, he changed these lines, oh, there's a bug right there in that line. That was great.

When we started working on Arcanum, I can't remember whether we used Perforce. I think we did, but we had a different problem on Arcanum in that the world editor needed to let multiple people edit the map because our world map was the entire map of Arcanum, so there's no way we could let someone check out the world map because yes, that would give you tant the city, but no one else could work on anything that was an external map in the entire world. So what we did for that one, and I described it more in one of the Arcanum videos, was when the editor started editing a sector, it would try to lock that sector, and the way it locked it was it would create a file on our network on a shared folder with the sector number as the file name and the extension Lo for lock because file creation is atomic in Windows, so we were basically leveraging something there. Where if you attempted to create the file and it already existed, somebody must have it locked, you could see who created the file, and that would tell you who did it. So we even had that functionality, we had a timestamp on it, so you could even say when they locked it, how long they'd had it checked out. If the file didn't exist, then nobody had it checked out, and it created the file for you, you know, with your name as the creator, and then you had that sector checked out. So World Ed on Arcanum used file creation on a network folder to create these sort of locks and unlocks because of that. That was more like editing world map sectors was more like doing stuff in Source Safe; it was an exclusive checkout, and there was no way to merge changing is, but we also didn't have a file history because once it checked back in, it just, that data went into the our database, and the lock was removed.

When we finally got to Temple and Vampire, I know we were using Perforce. Perforce was, from my point of view, just like everything you wanted in Source Safe but didn't get. So Source Safe finally had what was called non-exclusive checkout, which meant more than one programmer could grab a code module, more than one scriptor could grab a script. In theory, you could let more than one

 artist grab an art file, but we found the subsequent merging was very hard for that, so we usually, for non-text files, we usually disabled non-exclusive checkout, so it became exclusive checkout. But for non-exclusive checkout, the way it worked was two people could check it out at the same time. The first person to check it in, it just went in. When the second person would go to check it in, it would say, hey, the file I have in Source Safe is not the file you have checked out, let's merge it, and it would show the differences. On a good day, what you had worked on and what the other person had worked on were in different parts of the text, and you could simply say merge them and check in. On a bad day, you'd find out you two were working in the same area, and then you would have to work on that and figure out, well, they were making the for loop bigger, but I was changing what the for loop did, so we can combine those. Sometimes you find out someone was fixing something you were fixing, and boom, you just wasted some time, or the two of you did different fixes, and you have to go talk to him and say, which one do you want to use? In general, that tended not to happen because at least for the programmers, as the lead programmer, I would tend to assign different things. Well, Steve Moray was the lead programmer on Temple, I was the lead, well, I acted as the lead on Vampire. I would assign different things for people to do, and so they rarely overlapped in a module, and when they did, they were almost always working in different sections of the module.

Perforce though let you do some other really cool things that we did allow for code and non-code assets. One of them was called shelving. Shelving is when you do a bunch of work, but rather than you want to, rather than check it in and overwrite what's there, you shelve it, and what it does is it creates a special little area, and it checks that stuff in, and so that way, shelving was a way of working on something over multiple days but at the end of every day, you can still check it in, so if anything like if your machine crashed, you wouldn't lose anything, but because it was checked into a shelf, it was not included in the, if people did get, it was your own private little shelf, and then when you finally wanted to put it into the main branch, it would check to see if you had to do any merging. If you didn't, it would just overwrite what was there, and if you did, it would make you do the merge.

A very similar thing to that is called branching, and branching in Perforce is when you take all of the asset files and you create a completely separate branch, and then when you're checking in and out, you have to say which branch you're working in, and then you check in and out on that branch. Branching is really useful for doing something like you want to make a demo, so you branch the game, and you get the demo working, you know, maybe there's a few extra NPCs, a tutorial that gets thrown in, or maybe it's on a level that's not going to be included in the game, and all that data is just kept on the branch. Branching is also useful for once the game ships and goes out the door, and let's say you start working on DLC, those could be branches. Let's say you make patches, those could be branches, and the reason for that is you may one day want to go back to the original unpatched version, for different reasons. You may have someone who wants to see what the game was when you shipped, someone may want to make a version of your game on a different target, for example, you may have a PC version of the game, and now you want to make it for PlayStation, they may want to do that on the base branch because the fixes that were done, especially if there were optimizations, may not apply in any way to the PlayStation branch, but sometimes it would. I mean if there are bug fixes, and that's the good thing, you can go through and look at the check-ins and go, things that fixed mechanics and all that, boom, you want that, things that changed how stuff was rendered to the screen, you're probably not going to need that for the PlayStation version, so having those different branches worked really well, and was something I wish I could go back in time and have had that on all my games.

Anyway, I believe Perforce is still what's used today. We were using it on everything in Obsidian and on the Outer Worlds. It's a really good piece of software, but we've come a long way from Source Safe or from source control being it's whatever's on my machine is the real piece of code or whatever asset you're looking for. So it's come a long way in 40 some years, and I think that's a perfect example of where things have improved immensely and where software really helps in the development process. Anyway, I hope you liked the evolution of source control.

The First Time Fallout Was Almost Canceled.md
Youtube Link:
https://youtu.be/59Ez1oyamFU?si=gGqERrWa0dKBLJup

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim. Today I want to talk to you about the first time Fallout almost got canceled. Now, what's interesting about this, I don't think I've ever talked about it publicly, but I don't even think most people on the team know about this. Most people know about the whole GURP situation and that almost got the whole project tangled up. Maybe I shouldn't say cancel but certainly almost stalled, massively changed, whatever. I have mentioned that when Interplay got the D&D license, Fallout almost got canceled because they didn't see the need to divert resources to this Grade B product when they had D&D, that they called the license to print money. But there was one other time that it almost got canceled, and it was because of me. 

So let me walk you through a story. 

So the spring of '95, Scott Everts was looking at open houses in the Orange County area. He decided he wanted to buy some place, and he knew I had been saving up for the last four years. I've been saving super hard for a down payment, and I had one. I didn't go out to eat every day like everybody did at Interplay. I didn't buy a new car. I was still driving this old hatchback that I used for college. Our parking lot at Interplay was often jokingly referred to as the new car lot, and you know, I'm not talking about Fargo's Viper. I'm talking there was a day I came in and there were three brand new Mitsubishi Eclipse parked all right next to each other in the lot, all different colors. And that's because when a young person tended to get their first real job, they bought a new car. That was normal. But I was saving up. I was scrimping my pennies. I wanted to buy a place. I'd always had a goal before I turned 30. Then I'd buy a house. I know this is hard to realize then, it was hard to realize now, but it was hard to realize then too. I was 29. I was going to turn 30 at the end of the summer. 

So I went with Scotty to this open house. They had four models, and he was looking at the one-floor models, and I looked at the first two, and I had a book on how to buy a house, and I was pointing out things like, "Oh, this has really good flow. This isn't this nice." Scotty didn't really see what he wanted, but before we left, I'm like, "Let's look at the two-story models." And the first one we looked at was model four, and I saw all these things that were bad. I'm like, "Oh my God, look at this. There's a lot of hallways in here. The stairs take up half the living room wall. I mean, that's going to be a hard ball to figure out how to use." Then we looked at model three, the other two story, and I totally fell in love. It wasn't a big house. It was like 1200 square feet, but the stairs went up to a little teeny, like, square of space that opened up into three bedrooms and a bathroom. The downstairs was one big living room, dining room, kitchen, so no hallway. It had an attached garage, but the coolest thing I liked was it had a wrap-around yard. It wasn't a big yard, but it wrapped around to the front. Most of them had gates on the side, so you had a back and small side yard. This one, the gate was in front of the front door, which meant even back then, I was like, "I want to get a dog." So, I realized if I got this house, that if the front or back door opened and the dog got out, they would still be in the yard. They wouldn't be able to escape. I really liked this house. I thought about it all night. Scotty and I went left there and went off to lunch. When I went home that night, I'm like, I just kept thinking about it. So the next day, I drove there, and I wanted to put my name on the list for that particular house I saw with that particular yard, but to do that, I had to give a down payment, not the whole down payment, sort of like a deposit. And if I decided later I didn't want it, I'd lose the deposit, but if any other reason came up like something I would talk about soon, I'd get the deposit back. So they said, "Great." They took some information from me. They said, "We're passed it on to our uh, the guy who handles mortgages, and he'll get back to you." So I went back to Interplay. I think it was two or three days later, I heard from the guy. He said, "I'm gonna refund your deposit. You don't qualify for a mortgage." And I was like, "What do you mean?" He goes, "You are not paid nearly enough to qualify for a mortgage on this house, even if you put down 20 percent." And that was bite, but, of course, I qualified. I saved up for this mortgage, the down payment on the salary. I'm, I can easily pay what the monthly would be. And he goes, "Nope, in the eyes of the bank and our financial officers, you would not qualify." So I asked him what it would take to qualify, and he told me the minimum number. And then he said this. He goes, "I'm surprised how little you're paid. This is, you're in an industry. You're 29. This isn't your first job in that industry. You have several products behind you, and you not only have a bachelor's in computer science, you have a master's. I see a lot of applications across my desk, and you are vastly underpaid relative to your peers, people in your age group, and professional background." I said, "Well, what are they paid?" And he gave me a number way higher than what I needed to qualify for this mortgage. And this started to bug me because I was like, now, this would be like, I said, late spring, possibly early summer of '95, but I think it was late spring. So we were not only not Fallout, we were full-on GURPS. Wasn't a big team, but then it was, I think it was under 10 people. And this kind of bothered me. So I decided to go talk to Alan Pavlish and say, "Hey, I want to raise even though we were halfway through the year. It was not a raise time." So I told him, "Hey, I want to raise. I think I'm underpaid, and this is why I want it." And he's like, "I'm not going to give you a raise just because you want to buy a house." And I said, "Okay, but I really do want this house. So I'm gonna start looking around." And I said, "I already know before I came here, I turned down a job at McDonald Douglas. I'm going to call them up today and ask them about it. I just want you to know because I don't want you to

 be surprised if I come in in the next few days and give you a two-week notice." He said, "You would seriously do that? You'd abandon your project?" And I was like, "I just found out I'm massively underpaid. What, what's the story? What I'm going to talk about here?" And I will give him credit, and I don't know who he talked to, although I suspect he may have talked to a producer, Michael Koros, who was on Stonekeep, who I really looked up to, and that guy always had my back. I suspect he said something. I really do. But the next day, Alan Pavlish said, "What do you need to qualify?" And I told him what the minimum was. Probably should have upped it, but that's, I just said, "Well, the mortgage guy said this." And he helped me to that. He said, "We're do it. You know, don't go around bragging about this. We can't do it, and this is a one-time special thing, and you should feel special, and you know, now you're super well paid." Footnote, as I became a producer and started giving people raises, really found out that my pay as a programmer, there was still pretty middling. There were much better paid programmers who had less experience and less education than I did, and all the 3D programmers were paid better than a 3D artists were paid better than me. 3D artists were paid a lot, and this was a new thing in the mid '90s, mid to late '90s. They were all paid better than I was. I know this. I did their reviews, and I gave their bonus at the end. But I was like, you know what, I'm super happy. I called the mortgage guy, and he said, "Great. Um, that happened fast. I hadn't taken my name off. I hadn't asked for the deposit back, so technically I'm still in line for that one." I got the loan. I got the house. Um, technically I bought it before I turned 30, but I didn't get the key until after I turned 30. So whether or not I made my goal is debatable. The interesting thing is one of my neighbors had this huge, um, Doberman named Jake that decided I was his best friend in the whole world, and Jake would burst through their screen door and run at me, turn around, and sit on my foot and make me pet him. The first time that happened was a little scary. I'm like, I love dogs, but there is a 120-pound Doberman bearing down on me. They always apologize. They would lock that screen door. Jake broke it once to get out when he saw me at the mailbox. But I got to meet that family, and they told me how they really wanted my house because they liked the yard better. Mine was one of three that had that wrap-around yard in the entire complex of a hundred, and that they were hoping that I would refund my deposit. They had come one day after me and asked to be put on that list. Um, and I always felt a little bad about that because they had kids and everything, and I'm like, but I want to get a dog too. Jake would have loved that yard.

So, some of you may be going, well, wait, if you would quit, wouldn't Fallout have gone on? I'm like, well, maybe, but I don't know who would have taken my spot. I had a lot of code invested in it, and you gotta remember, there were two more points coming up in the near future where when we got the D&D license, and I begged it not to be canceled, and then again when we lost the GURP's license, and I said, "Look, I can replace my libraries pretty quickly." I'm not sure if we, if we would have gotten through both of those choke points without my begging and pleading and crunching. Maybe, but I always look back at that as like, I think I put the project in jeopardy.

But this is something I want to get back to when I talk about nuance because I know there are two radical interpretations to this video, and I hope people don't make them. I'm telling you right now, there are two groups out there that won't want to spin this. There's the first group to go, "Wow, Tim is really a jerk. He was willing to put the entire project at jeopardy because he wanted to buy a house. What an entitled maniac, egomaniac." I think that's a radical interpretation of the story I just told. Another way though is going, "Oh my goodness, Interplay massively, unknowingly underpaid him. What horrible, evil people." You know, they offered me a job at an amount, and I took it. I'm a big boy. I had my big boy pants on. Now, later when I found out I was being underpaid, I made a big boy decision. I'll go somewhere that pays me better. That's kind of the interpretation of Tim is a victim, you know, Interplay bad guy, that I'm trying to get people to avoid. There is a middle road here, which is I accepted a job for the pay. Later on, I realized it didn't let me achieve some life goals that I wanted, and I wanted to get one of those life goals achieved, and I, I tried, and guess what, everything worked out. The moral of the story that I think you should walk away with is the development of Fallout occurred on a knife edge. Multiple times during its development, it could have fallen either way and never been made. Sometimes those were decisions that the company was making, sometimes it was decisions that individuals on the team were making. I will tell you though, individual stories that that involved me, that I was personally involved with, but I will tell you there were other individuals on the team that made store, that made decisions on a personal basis that did affect the development of Fallout and endangered it, but those stories are those people's stories to tell. So I don't want you walking away thinking I was a hero or a villain or victim or the dinner play was or that anybody on the team was, but just that game development is hard, and it is fraught with peril, and that peril comes from all directions. Looking back, I always go, "Wow, it's super lucky Fallout even ever got made." But I could tell you similar stories about Arcanum, Temple vampire, WildStar, South Park, pillars, tyranny, outer worlds, every game I ever worked on. In hindsight, you could tell that it passed over a very dangerous period where bad things could have happened and were successfully navigated around. That's what I'm hoping these stories help people who are in game development get some perspective on their own games and people aren't in game development get some understanding of how games are made. So I hope you enjoy that fun story about how I endangered Fallout.

The Four Steps for fixing Design Problems.md
Youtube Link:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxAhEocaE0

Hi everyone, it's me Tim, and today I want to talk about fixing design problems. These are not bugs. I'm not talking about the game is, you know, near in completion and there are things that aren't working right. I'm talking about you make a design, give it to your programmers, and they're like, "We gotcha," and they implement it, and the artists all go, "Here's your good stuff, put it in. Here's everything you asked for," and it's all in and working exactly the way you asked, but there's a problem.

Now I'm going to use an example from the original Fallout game, a design problem that it shipped with, so I can use that as an example as we're going through. So, in the original Fallout, you could buy an energy weapon skill. In fact, you could tag it right at the beginning of the game if you wanted to. The only problem is energy weapons aren't available for at least the first half and closer to the first 2/3 of the game. So, you have tagged or spent points in a scale that will be completely and utterly useless to you. So, this is a problem because it may not be what was intended, but it's certainly what the design allows, and it is not a bug. Everything is working exactly the way the design document said.

So, I think there are four steps when you have a design problem. Step one is simply to notice that you have the problem, something we did not do in Fallout. So, for a game like Fallout, the issue is you have so many different types of PCs (player characters) that when you do a playtest, you may not notice that issue, especially if you're playing a player character that doesn't even have that skill because you don't have that skill, you're not noticing that there aren't any energy weapons dropping in the game.

QA might not notice the problem either, not just because of the characters they're making, but they may make a character that has the energy weapon skill, but they don't think this is a problem. It seems to be what's planned, that energy weapons come late, so they may or may not report it. They may think it's what's intended. For both of those reasons, that you may be playing a character that isn't affected by it or you may be playing a character that is and you think it's supposed to be that way.

This is another reason why I like Telemetry or logging or whatever you want to do in your game to record game sessions so that you can collect these sessions and then run a report and go, "Hey, what's the, uh, show me when energy weapons tend to show up and where they come from," and then you notice they're all shoved to the end of the game, and you're like, "Huh, that's a problem."

So now that you've noticed that problem exists, the first thing you want to do, or the second step, is confirm that the problem is really a problem. This may sound obvious, but a lot of people don't take this step where you think you've noticed a problem, but now you actually want to make sure if it's really a problem. In this case, with the energy weapons, you want to make sure this is an issue of the energy weapons literally not being available versus this just being randomness and a low sample size.

I've talked in earlier videos about nobody understands randomness, so maybe there is a vendor who randomly has an energy weapon, and they've just never had it on your playthrough. I've had this happen to me where people say, "Hey, I've played the game five times, and that vendor never had an energy weapon." And if you look and go, "Well, there's a one in three chance there's an energy weapon at that vendor," well, guess what, 1 in 3 to the fifth power is only something like 1 in 300 or something. It might be less than that. The point here is you could play the game 300 times and notice in one of those playthroughs that that vendor never ever has it, so it's not that rare of an event.

So, you'd have to go back and look in your, um, look in the game to see if that's actually something that just can happen randomly, or it's really happening. And again, this is why Telemetry helped because it doesn't look at one playthrough or 10 playthroughs, it looks at thousands of playthroughs. And I wish we had had this because we even though we had QA playing our game all day, every day, Fallout was a 40-hour game to get through the main story arc and some of the side quests.

So, what tended to happen was we delivered a new build to them once a week, and everyone in QA could play through with a player character once on that build. If you wanted to play from start to finish, it took you 40 hours to do it, which is a full week. So, what happens when you're confirming the problem is you go look at the design docs. Is the lack of an energy weapon dropping anywhere, is this expected? Does it appear in any vendor list? Does it appear in any loot list of creatures that can show up earlier in the game?

Now, you can look at the design docs to see if that was actually written down as a goal. Remember, I told you to put goals in your design docs. Maybe there's a goal here saying we want all scales to be available, even ones that won't be usable yet. So, maybe that's something someone wanted. We didn't use goals in the Fallout design doc, so that's a problem right there. I can see people arguing, "Well, people can always just buy the energy weapon skill later." Sure, they can, but letting them buy it early is completely wasting points, and it's misleading to them. It's saying, "Here's a skill you can use. Oh, but you're never going to be able to use it." That'd be like not putting any locks into the last map of the game and saying, "Well, you know, I know you tagged pick locking, but or lockpicking, but too bad, you're not going to use it till the end of the game."

So, that's bring this to the third step, which is now fixing the problem. And you may think, "Well, that's really obvious, just put some energy weapons in the game early." You sure, you can. The big question there is where will you put them because depending on where you put them, they might still be missed by most people on a common playthrough. If the only energy weapon is, you know, in a character's inventory that you're unlikely to kill or pickpocket, or if it's has a low chance of dropping in a vendor table or a low chance of dropping off some creature, or maybe it's a creature people tend not to encounter or when they do, they don't kill it, you may still have energy weapons not appearing early enough in the game to make that skill worthwhile.

Also, if you put a lot of them in, they're probably going to have to be weak or low-level energy weapons, which again, may make people go, "Well, this is why did I spend points to have

 these sad weapons." So, another problem or another solution, which is not as obvious, is change your system design. This is something that you can do pretty easily by just saying, "Hey, the energy weapon skill is locked until the player's a certain level," or some other prerequisite is met. You can do skill specialization and say energy weapon is a special specialization of the weapon skill, and you have to put so many points into the weapon skill before you can specialize it into energy weapons. Then it's something there for the player to build towards, but he's putting points in the base weapon skill, which lets him use the weapons that are already in the game, and by the time he has enough points in that, and he's specializing the energy weapons, that's when things the energy weapons will tend to drop in the game.

That is exactly what we did in the Outer Worlds. We put specialization skills under base skills. So, in the Outer Worlds, you had to spend points in the ranged combat skill until it hits 50, and then you can start specializing. I believe it was like, um, single-handed guns, long guns, and heavy weapons. So, it didn't matter that heavy weapons were a little more rare than the other two, people weren't spending points in that skill. They were basically spending just points in generic range combat until got high enough to specialize it, and that's one way of fixing your design problem without having to change loot tables or, uh, make item re-itemize the world. You basically do it in the skill system itself.

And then now leads us to the very important fourth step that sometimes people forget, which is test the solution you just put in. I've already pointed out ways you could have fixed the energy weapon skill, you know, by potentially dropping it early in ways that would fail, either it still has a good chance of not showing up, or the things that drop are so weak and bad that nobody really considers this a solution. So, what you should always do is after you've made these changes, you have to go back in and test them. Even better, make a test plan for QA and have them, when they test it, know that this is a problem and here's a test plan of what you want them to go do, like make a note of when you find energy weapons or when you get the energy weapon skill. Is the energy weapon skill useful, and are you using it? Those kinds of things for them to test.

And then while you're doing this, while you're involved in the energy weapon skill and doing stuff like that, look at the other skills that are on the player list and see, do any of these have an issue? For example, lockpicking, are there enough locks to pick? Disarming traps, are there enough traps out there? Um, all the different subtypes of melee weapons, are they in the game? Are they dropping correctly? Uh, are there chances for the player to use first aid and Doctor frequently? Do these conditions get applied frequently enough that they want to use them? Are there items that fix these things, so no player would ever want to take those skills?

These are things you should look at because, while none of these are bugs per se, they're problems in the design. And this is what I've always told designers, is that you can write a perfect design document and can get implemented exactly the way you intended by the programmers, and all the assets can be made beautifully and wonderfully and work perfectly by all your artists, and you still get it in the game, and you're like, "Huh, this isn't really what I want," or "It's what I asked for, but it's not what we should have." Those are the kind of design problems you need to fix, and this is the four-step method to fixing them, which is notice it, confirm it, fix it, and test it.

So, I hope this was a good summary of fixing design problems in computer games.

The Fun of The Temple of Elemental Evil.md
Youtube Link:
https://youtu.be/lb6agFgh11E?si=C0oZZ35RbjcUEMsD

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim. So yesterday's video about Temple development to evil was a little heavier. I thought I'd follow it up with a description of how fun it was to make Temple of Elemental Evil, so kind of a Counterpoint to yesterday's. The first thing I have to say is when I was approached about making a D&D game, I was ecstatic. I mean, 14-year-old D&D playing Timmy was going, it was just super exciting, especially because I got to pick the module. You know, when I picked Temple of Unto evil and just so people know, that was the part of a grand plan. I was going to make Temple of Elemental Evil, I was going to follow it up because I assumed it would do spectacularly with the D series modules, The Descent Into the Depths, the whole drow series what it's called, followed with the penultimate, uh Q6. Wait, wait, no, I back up. I was going to do the G Series, the Giants, and then the Hill fire cloud and then go into the drow series and Then followed up with Queen of the Demon Web Pits. Turns out, um, I mean they're all Greyhawk, the levels worked, uh, so you could just keep playing the same party if you wanted to. I had big plans. I mean, I was super excited by this, and this was all like in the first few months. I mean, I was really excited. I really wanted to do stuff. I picked Temple. I had to cut up; I owned one module of it. We were having trouble finding it quickly enough, so I cut mine up, pristine module front that I'd owned since the 80s, and so we could distribute it to people so the artists could look at the maps and designers could pick different areas and work on them.

The most exciting thing happened, I'd say, about a year in, is I got to call Gary Gygax and ask him some questions. Now, sidebar, a lot of people go, especially when I'm in meetings, I'm very good at controlling my emotional state. I've been told that by friends, by family, by colleagues. So I want you to know that when I was on the phone with Gary Gygax, I was like, oh my God, but what I had externally was, well hello Mr. Gygax, what a pleasure it is to speak with you. I have many questions. And we talked, I want to say, for about 40 minutes. It was so cool to talk to him. I had so many questions about the module. There were things that were contradictory, um, by the way, spoiler alert for a more than 30-year-old module, probably a 40-year-old module. There is a prince, Prince Thrommel, and he had a sword called Fragarach. Ramos said to be a paladin, those are only lawful good. Fragarach was chaotic good. It's an intelligent sword that actually damages any lawful good that touches it. I did not understand this. Mr. Gygax said that he was planning to introduce chaotic good paladins, sort of a Celtic Flair is what he said. It was going to be on paladins, and I was like, oh, this is Way Beyond the scope of anything I could do. I doubt if I could even get it approved, so I didn't do that. But it was super exciting to hear. He also told me that Zuggtmoy, the fungal demon princess who lived at the bottom of the temple, was not originally the boss of the temple. It was supposed to be an elder Elemental God that was even in levels below where you found Zuggtmoy, but he ran out of time, so that was never made. But there are elements of it that appear here and there in the module if you read it. He also told me that it was supposed to connect to Lolth. There were at least two agents of Lolth in the module that we retained in the computer version because she really had plans for the temple. She had plans within plans within plans. So my connecting it to those modules was something he not only approved of but he had planned to do himself. So that was great, but the best part of this conversation was at the end, and he was, he had been sick, he had a stroke. He said that he was really happy to have talked to me because he felt like things were in good hands. And I said, well, you really inspired me when I was young. And his response was, I hope you do the same and inspire young people too. I hope I did. I hope I did, Mr. Gygax. He passed away soon after. Uh, this isn't as positive. I see it is possible. Let me talk about so when we first started making Temple, I had mentioned that I had made a module, Bandits, necromancers, to teach everyone the rules. I wanted everyone to play Third Edition, so they understood what the game was like. Now, some people on the team had played a lot of D&D, if not Third Edition, but one person, Sean Craig, a programmer, had also played Third Edition, and he wanted to DM. I want to tell you some stories from that campaign because this will give you a good insight into our Team Dynamics.

So we made characters. I don't remember everyone's characters, but here are the important ones we had. Mary, we had Steve Moray made a thief. I made a cleric of a god of luck, which gave me Dimension Door as an ability, meaning I could just randomly teleport, uh, indoors 100 feet, Outdoors a few hundred yards, and I could even carry a person. So me and a friend, we had Mary Meister playing a wizard, and that was Mary was Steve's girlfriend. This is important later. And Peter Delgado, the uh, one of our artists, he made an orc fighter, and he rolled really low for his Charisma. I don't remember if it was a three, but I think it was a three. Now, this is Third Edition, so he didn't have to make an assassin; it was a fighter. And I remember telling him, I said, you know, Peter, your Charisma's three. This is a really ugly fighter. And he goes, no, he's not ugly, um, he's beautiful. He just has a bad personality. Like, hmm, and the name of the fighter was Cheryl of e Temple.

Somewhere early in our campaign, we had found a magic ax, and Cheryl could use axes; could you use axes well? I think he even had to leave. He wanted it. Now, of course, it was good to have a fighter with a powerful weapon, but we're like, it's hard to divide one weapon among the whole group, and it sold for like 20,000 gold. We're like, well, we could sell it and divide the money. No, Peter was like, no, Cheryl's keeping it. We're like, okay. Weeks later, we're on an adventure. We step into a room, Cheryl steps first, you know, he's a fighter. Standing next to the door was a giant troll. I don't know if it had an ax or sword;

 it had something sharp, and it rolls a sneak attack on Cheryl. Sean rolled the dice behind his, uh, DM screen, but then he lifted it up so we could all see that he rolled a 20. I'm sure it was already hurt, so Sean said, I rolled the damage in front of you, and he rolls damage. So it's a maximum sneak attack, critical hit. Cheryl took so much damage that not only did she drop to negative, which would be unconscious and past negative 10, which is dead, we got hit past negative 50, which is destroyed. So Sean says, well, the troll swings down and chops Cheryl completely in half. Blood and viscera spray everywhere. We're all like, and everybody's really quiet, and I don't know why I said this. I went, wow, Cheryl's even ugly on the inside. And everybody starts laughing; at this horrible moment got transformed. But then, when we finished killing the troll, which we managed to do, and we're collecting his treasure, we go to get Cheryl's thing because Peter's like, I'm gonna make a new character to avenge Cheryl. The ax is missing; it's not there. And we're like, wait a minute, and sounds like you look everywhere, and it's an ax. We could tell if someone had it; no one was holding it, and we're like, when's gone. And Peter was irate; he was like, no, I'm bringing a new character. I'm gonna get that ax. He was convinced one of us had it; he didn't know how, he didn't know why, he didn't know where it was, but he was like, I know.

So he makes a new character. A few weeks later, we're adventuring in woods. We get attacked by giant bees. Whatever. For some reason, they were slaughtering us. We were losing health; our spells and abilities weren't doing anything. We were losing, and we were losing badly. And I was like, thinking, this is not going to end well. And we're outside in a fairly dense Woods if I picked a few hundred yards in a direction, I'd be invisible; no one would know where I was. So I decide I'm kind of Dimension Doorway. When I start saying that to Sean, the DM, Mary says, take me. I'm out of spells; I'm almost out of health. And she's right next to me, so I tell Sean, okay, I'm gonna touch Mary. Steve says, Sean, can I whisper something to Tim? And Sean said, yes, but it has to be really short. And Steve goes, it's okay, it's four words. He writes something on a sub of paper and hands it to me. I read it, and I look at Sean. I go, I take my hand off Mary, put my hand on Steve, and dimension doorway, boom, we're gone. Mary gets killed the next round; she's mad. I don't know who she's more mad at, me or her boyfriend, Steve. Everybody wants to know what's on that paper. The session ends. I could talk to Steve. The four words on that paper, I have Peter's ax. Steve had an item called a glove of holding that worked like a bag of holding, but when you touch something, it could go in the bag, the glove. He had rolled his sleight of hand; he's a thief. He took it; he took the night, he took the max, and he'd had it all those weeks. Everywhere we went, he was always looking for a good time to sell it. Of course, afterward, we had a discussion that he had to split that money. But the question then is, is Peter going to find out what is it worth? Says Steve, for Peter, find out. I honestly remember don't remember what happened after that point. But that should give you a good idea of the Timber and tone of a Troika DND session, and it was a great team, and everybody loved D&D. We loved making it. It was just a rough development. Anyway, I thought you'd like to hear some good stuff about Temple. There it is.
Title: 
The Future Of Games

Youtube Link:
https://youtu.be/9GX0T_Khs28?si=KQ74nqtmqis2JwAR

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim. Today, I want to talk about the future of games—like where I think games are going to go. I've talked before that there's a lot of different YouTube channels I like watching, and one of them is called like Stories of Old, and I was watching it recently, and they were talking about how movies have gone through a bunch of phases from traditional to Modern to postmodern to metamodern. I don't pretend to understand all of that. I've said many times I'm not the best writer, but my understanding was Modern stories were modern movies had stories where the characters were unchanging and had very distinct values, and then the story was them going through an event.

Postmodern was kind of tropes version; they like twists, you know? It's "oh, it wasn't who you thought" or the killer wasn't who you thought, or even fourth wall breaking that happens a lot where the viewer is invited to watch the movie for what it is—a story. And then there's metamodern, which I won't claim to understand but seems to be more of using those elements that postmodern use like trope aversion or fourth wall breaking to show you that it's just a story, to instead tell the story more deeply than It's Been Told before.

Now, for games, all that applies. Games are also trying to tell a story, so all of that stuff applies. I highly recommend, by the way, you watch that channel. I'll link it below. But games have other things too, that I don't think are going to be my focus for what I think the future of games are. I don't think it's better graphics. We already have super realistic Graphics. I mean, now we're starting to say things like, "look, the light beams have dust motes in them." Great, is the game more fun because of it? Does it affect anything in the game? I don't think VR is the future of games. I don't even think multiplayer with a lot more people is the future of games. In fact, I think the future of games is the one thing that games have going for them that you don't get from movies and TV shows and books, and that's interaction. The interaction of the player with the systems of the games is something that I think will become a lot more richer and deeper in the future.

Now, people already love system interaction. I'm sure you've played games where you've discovered that you can solve a quest in a particularly novel way that you didn't think of, and maybe even the quest designer didn't think of, where you used an explosive in an unusual way, and that wasn't what they were planning, but okay, it works. I'm sure you may have even seen funny behaviors from NPCs like if NPCs are supposed to look at something of interest and react to it. I'm sure you've seen games where the NPC is walking down the street and sees a dead body and goes "oh no" and then immediately sees a vista and goes "oh pretty." And that's just funny, that they're like "oh no, oh pretty." It's just not how you expected it would work, but it's funny and it's memorable. I see tons of little video clips on YouTube of people showing things like this from their games. People obviously like them.

So, what I would like to see is where we have more interaction in games, where because you can write the systems in a richer, deeper way, the game itself has tons of more interaction. Sorry, dogs moving around. I'll give you some examples. I love the idea that in the future, RPGs will have quests that want you to do something but have no scripted, coded means of doing it; it's all emergent from the system rules. Example, let's say you're supposed to kill a guy. Yes, you can just walk in and stab him. Yes, you can take an arrow and poison it and shoot it in the window, so now you poisoned him. But what if you actually, while he was out of his house, went in and poisoned all the food in his cupboard? Then you leave, you can leave town, you may be somewhere else, riding on your horse to another town, and you get the message "Bob is dead" because he comes back into his house and eventually eats some food. I've done something kind of like this in RPGs, but you could tell they were always scripted. This was something they planned for and expected you to do. This is just something that emerges from the fact that you can create poison, and people eat food in their house.

There are other things that I see, and this is stuff AI can help with, where when you're talking to NPCs, where I get to, instead of picking off a list, I get to pick the questions I want to ask, and they respond. Something like we had in the original Fallout, where you could click on a button to pick a topic, and you could ask things and write in phrases to see if they responded. But this is something where, um, an AI, like an LLM, which has been trained for that NPC—here's what the NPC knows, here's what they don't, here's how they talk—will actually respond to you asking them questions in a voice and animation. That's something that'd be really cool and really make a world feel so much more alive if you could go around and do that, if it wasn't somebody just standing there waiting for you to come along and go, "hey, I have a quest to give you." Instead, they're standing there like, "oh God, I can't believe it," and when you talk to him like, "my husband's missing," "uh, want me to go help?" "Help? Well, I don't know, who are you?" You know, and I don't even know where, when I just found this weird arrowhead. That would be really cool.

So, other things would be that, and this is again with AI, and it's an interaction, but it's an interaction at the World level, is that you could find unique places and unique items that are procedurally generated, that aren't necessarily something that your friends are finding or that were in the game the last time you played. Now, I know some people don't like this, so maybe it's an option that you can turn it off, or maybe it's new game plus, you know, when that idea when you play a whole game and it says do you want to start over and New Game Plus opens up different ways the world can work that didn't the first time through. Maybe the new game plus option is okay, now that you're playing again, we're going to procedurally generate some dungeons, or, and some monsters, and some items in out-of-the-way places, so that when you explore the world, it's the same base world, but it's got a very different set of specific things in it. I think that sounds cool, and also if that's still something you wouldn't like, I could still see developers in the future using particularly generated, um, AI, uh, content, vetting it, and then they add the curated ones into the game. So, you're trying to add more dungeons into the game, you're trying to add more quests of a certain

 nature like stealth quests, and AI generates a ton of them, you go through them, vet them, figure out which ones are good, maybe make some modifications because like, "oh, I don't really like how this worked, but I'm going to fix it by adding this NPC or putting this route through the dungeon," and then those curated ones are what are added to the game. I basically see it as a tool of giving people more stuff to interact with.

One thing I really think could be better is Magic. Magic battles and Magic interaction in the environment and with other spells is something that you don't see a lot of. I've played a few games that do it, but you can tell it's something they planned for, designed, spec it all, and it works for the things like yes, when I made this area wet and then through a lightning bolt, it became a chain lightning, but then other things don't seem to work like I made this area wet and I threw a fireball, wait, why are they taking as much damage, they're wet, they should be taking less damage. So, I see this as instead of being painstakingly coded things, I see it as being, you're capable of making rules in your environment and saying things like this spell makes things wet, wet things take more electrical damage and Arc, the electrical damage to nearby other wet things, wet things when they get cold freeze, so things that are wet when they're cold move slower, surfaces that are wet when they get cold become slippery, boom, tons of things that are now happening in the environment. Wet things take less fire damage, but fire, fire nearby or on them make them dry faster, oh, did I mention that wet things get dry over time? These are all rules you can put into your game and then support it all, and you could really see some really cool magic battles that you didn't intend for where one person's shooting out a jet of water and someone else freezes it, or someone else shoots it with a jet of flame, and all this stuff is interacting because you didn't code it for that, it was, it's part of the base fundamental physics rules of the game.

This is where I see games going, this is where I see the future of games. Now, take all this with a grain of salt, I don't know what's going to happen, but especially when I play older RPGs where they're doing the same thing, but their list of actions and interactions are smaller, and you're like, "oh, I wish this was a modern game so I could break down that door or break the lock off that chest or bribe my way past this guard rather than just my only option is to kill him." What we're seeing is a broader set of interactions in modern games. What I want to do is take that to the next level and make interactions as part of the systemic code, AS physics, where you basically just things cause other things to change traits, and that's those traits are how the world works. So, this is what I'd love to see in the future of games, this is what I love to see as like the Baseline, so most games support this in the future. Don't know if this is where it's going to go, but an interesting idea I had just from watching that channel like Stories of Old. Also, I do touch upon this briefly in another video I have called Multiple Quest Solutions, so you might want to watch that too. I'll link both of those below. Anyway, that was my idea today. I hope you liked it.

The Music of Fallout.md
Youtube Link:
https://youtu.be/FLq3h5zk1LA?si=LzYzjqRUxgJVbHrU

Hi, it's me, Tim. Today I want to talk about something that's near and dear to me, which is Fallout's music. I love ambient music, I have since college when a fellow engineer friend of mine, Leila, let me listen to a Jean-Michel Jarre album and I was hooked. I bought all those albums, I bought Brian Eno albums, I got into Patrick O'Hearn, just all the ambient stuff from the late '70s through the '80s and '90s I was buying all the time.

When I got to Interplay in the '90s, it was a bit overcrowded. They were in a building I remember. We were so frustrated with how overcrowded it was at one time we went out and counted and there were like 90 parking spaces but we had 120 employees, that's how bad it was. If you came in late, you just couldn't find a parking spot. It was similar inside with how we had to sit and I was placed in a room called "the pit" which had 14 other people in it and my cubicle, which the cubicle walls weren't even five feet, they're probably like four feet. Mine was right next to the fax machine so all day I would just hear "eh" and then just paper shot out and then of course people would gather around the fax machine and chat and if I complained people were saying, "Well, we're doing business." No, I think talking about your kid's soccer game is not doing business, so I just went out and bought headphones and I just played ambient music 24/7. Whenever I was at work I had my headphones on and I had ambient music going.

So when I started Fallout, actually Fallout had another producer at the beginning, Tom Decker. I should do a whole thing about that. I found all my meeting notes which means I have a complete agenda now of the Fallout timeline. When I took over as project leader I finally got an office but I still liked listening to ambient music and poor JT Jason Taylor. I remember there was one Aphex Twin song I liked called "Ventolin" that started with a high-pitched yeah. JT hated that song so much. But hey, I was in an office now, I didn't need headphones. I think I switched back to headphones anyway because I have all these notes. I know what songs I picked or what musicians I picked because I found the email that I sent to the audio director Charles Deanan. I could do a whole video about Charles Deanan too. His favorite word was... I would. I sent him a list of the music I liked and said I would love if music could be made that sounded like it belonged on CDs with this music. So I found the list of musicians I sent and it was Brian Eno, Aphex Twin, Synesthesia, Najimu, Techno Animal, Future Sound of London, O-Rang, Scorn, and then I threw some Depeche Mode on there not because they're ambient but just because I like Depeche Mode and it had that dark element I liked.

And sure enough, when Charles Deanan told me that he had hired a musician named Mark Morgan and he had taken my notes and we did have some back and forth. I mean he sent me some stuff and I would send him responses and then I started dropping in the game and the team would have comments but Mark did such a good job. I don't know if he's ever talked about the process but it was one of the smoothest processes of making music for a game I've ever been involved with and I loved the final music. We loved it so much that Scott Everett burned CDs for all of us for the Fallout soundtrack and I think Jason Anderson, it was his idea to call it the soundtrack of a more "bunned" world.

One day because I found this in my notes as well I will sit here and list all of the names we had for Fallout before Brian Fargo came up with the name Fallout because some of them are really bad and "More Bund" shows up in a lot of them. Anyway, that's where Fallout's music came from. Huge debt of gratitude to Mark Morgan and Charles Deanan and all those ambient musicians that I love so much.

The Origin of Dumb Dialog.md
Youtube Link:

Hi, it's me, Tim. Today, I want to tell a story, one of my favorite stories. It's the origin of dumb dialogue in Fallout, and not even just in Fallout. I mean, once we used it there, we did in Arcanum, we kept using it. Most recently, it appeared in The Outer Worlds. In fact, one of the narrative designers in The Outer Worlds came to me one day and said, "You know, dumb dialogue's a lot of work, but whenever I get stuck, I just think, 'What would Tim say?'" I think he meant that as a compliment, anyway.

So let's talk about dumb dialogue. Need some context for it. The time is 1979. The Starship Enterprise had only ever had one captain. The Atari VCS was the console that ruled the land, and clear sodas were still 10 years off in the future. This is a story of how 14-year-old me learned how to play Dungeons and Dragons. My mother came home from work and she said, "Hey, Tim, some boys at work are playing a game I think you might like." And by boys, she meant naval officers, captains, even. There was even an admiral because my mom worked in the Judge Advocate General's Office of the U.S. Navy, and some people there were doing weekend gaming sessions. So we went to someone's house one weekend, and we all made characters, and we played through a dungeon. Yes, I played with my mother. Now, she didn't really get into it. She spent a lot of that time trading recipes with this captain's wife, but as soon as we got home, I was like, "I must have these books." Went and bought the, I think I got the monster manual, and then the player's handbook, and then the DM's guide. Started making all these ideas, all these adventures and dungeons, got together three or four friends from high school, and we played every single weekend, and we'd switch off DMing.

One thing I learned as a DM, I learned two big lessons when I was a dungeon master that stuck with all the games I made. The first one was players will never, ever, ever do what you think they're gonna do. I make a big dungeon, and my characters spend most of the session looking for a shopkeeper's missing cat. So what I ended up doing was making a lot of lists of ideas, sometimes not even fully formed ideas. I might be like, "Oh, there's a bandit camp out in those woods, and there's a necromancer lair in those mountains, and somehow they're connected." That way, if they ask for rumors and they wanted to have a mini adventure when they're going around, I could, I had things ready to throw in their way. And these were where side quests came from. I learned to anticipate players aren't going to do what you think they're going to do. That even applied to individual quests. They maybe they didn't go in the front door, maybe they wanted to parlay with the villain rather than kill him. This is what all factored into Fallout's multiple ways of solving quests.

The other thing I learned, though, was that my players liked it when they got special rules applied to them, either they found a magic item that was specialized, or in the case of one of my friends, Joel, he had a cleric. And I decided that it was kind of boring that D&D treated all clerics of any god the same. This is well before Third Edition had their domains. So for each god, I created a special ability and a special restriction. And Joel's god's ability was he could send a message once a day to any other priest of his god, 15 words or less, anywhere in the world. And boy, did he use that. He used that to find information, to send out distress signals, to warn other people. It was really cool. But the restriction was anything that came off of him, clothes, hair, nail clippings, poop, he had to destroy. So every at the end of every adventuring day, the other players got used to the fact that Joel's priest would build a big bonfire and burn anything that he was getting rid of. It also meant that once, a match guy and went to Joel, it was his. What was interesting about that is later on, he got, he built a, the cleric stronghold, I think he made a temple. He didn't want to do the bonfire thing anymore, so what he did is he dug a pit, and he threw green slime into it, and he just throw things in there, and the green slime would destroy it. And when the green slime got too big, he'd take a little scraping off of it, broke your disease to kill the big green slime, and put the scraping back in. So that was fun. So Joel really liked it, and he was saying, "I really love it. It's more interesting to play a character," which might have been the origin of flaws in Outer Worlds, which also came from disadvantages and GURPS, but this was way before even that stuff existed.

So, Joel, one day the group is making a new character, and Joel wanted to make a character, and we did the 4d6 method, and he rolled four ones, which means even if he threw away the smallest one, the lowest number, he still had a three. So Joel was like, "I'm gonna make a fighter. I'll put that three in intelligence, and it's not gonna matter." And D intelligence controls languages and spell use. His fighter didn't care. So I told him, "Okay, because you're so dumb, you can only speak in single syllable words." And he was like, "Fine." And I said, "Okay, but I'm gonna ding you if you say anything that's more than one syllable." So we started adventures. Joel was really good at it. His character was like, "You know, me kill bad guy. Super good." They went into a dungeon, and a portcullis fell and separated the party. There was Joel on one side and the rest of the group on the other. They said, "Hey, you're the fighter. You'll find a way back to us." So Joel went off into the dungeon on his side, checked out some rooms, had a couple encounters, but then he came out of a ledge that overlooked a big huge cavern, and there was a pile of treasure, and there was a glowing sword, and a staff, and some chain mail, and he was like, "!" But on top of that pile, big red dragon. So Joel backed out the ledge, kept going through the dungeon, finally met up with the original group, and he was so excited. And I was like, I told him, "You can't say 'dragon.' You can't say 'lizard.' I can't even say 'fire dude.'" He's like, "Loot. Big. Red. Heat." Until he went, "Oh, is there a fire elemental?" And he's like, "No." "Uh, red heat." And I was like, "Is it a trap of some kind? What are you talking about?" He said, "No. Bite." And I said

, "Is it a vampire?" And he was like, "No." They probably spent five minutes trying to figure out what it was he saw, and it was so funny. And the whole campaign went on like that, with this really, really dumb fighter, and it was so much fun.

And so when we started working on Fallout, and I had to slowly, you know, assemble a team and bits and pieces from everywhere, we used to play groups, uh, every Thursday night, to try to learn the system, because Fallout was originally based on GURPS. And I told that story, and people really liked the idea of putting that in as a low intelligence restriction. And I was like, "Okay, but our narrative team has to be on board with that." And they were. And so they started writing these really funny dialogues, to the point where there are even a few quests in Fallout that you can do faster and easier if you're dumb. I still remember there's a super mutant, and he just says, "Huh?" And you're like, "What?" He's like, "Duh." And you're like, "Mom?" And he gets so confused, he just steps aside, and you can walk into an area that normally you'd have to fight that guy. I just, I loved that. Literally, almost 20 years after I learned how to play D&D, that here we are, about 15 years, here we are making a computer role-playing game that would turn into Fallout, and this is the genesis of this whole idea.

Anyway, I guess the moral of that story is a lot of experiences can go to inform your game design. One day, I'm gonna record my, you know, "10 things I learned about level design that I learned by going to Disneyland a lot." I'll record that soon. But anyway, I wanted to tell the story. Bye.

The Origin of Fallout Setting.md

Hi everyone, it's me Tim. Today I want to talk about the beginning, the creation of the origin of the Fallout setting. If you remember what I said in my video about design documents, it all starts with setting, and I want to talk about that. What prompted me to think about this was somebody I know who's in the industry. I've never worked with them, said I'd be interested to know more about how Fallout's setting got created, and I thought I had mentioned it but looking back, I've dropped little bits and pieces here and there in other videos, so I'm gonna try to make you a timeline of what happened.

To create this timeline, I had to do a lot of research. I had both digital and actual packed away notes, and while going through those boxes, that's when I found this shirt, which I don't think I've worn in five years, so minimum maybe longer. That's why it's all wrinkly, sorry. But it also made me realize that I don't always remember things, and neither do other people I talk to, because I found dated written notes that mentioned some things I'm like, I don't remember that.

So it's sort of like the naming of Fallout, where when I actually went back and looked at the names we came up on the brainstorm meeting where Brian Fargo was not there, and then I went to talk to Brian about naming days later or maybe even a week later, and he thought of Fallout. I think he really did come up with that name independently. I don't think he had heard on our list, but if somebody asked me who came up with the name, if you would ask me until a few months ago, I would have said Brian Fargo, but whoever was in that meeting would probably go, no, that name was mine. That's why it's so hard to pinpoint who was the original source of an idea because there's no doubt in my mind that Brian thought of that name independently, and he also, he was the one who explained why it was such a good name, and so he's the one I'm like, he's the one responsible for the name Fallout, even if yes, somebody and I don't remember who thought of the name first.

There's a lot of things like that. So let me get into the creation of the Fallout setting, and along the way, we can talk about who had the ideas and when they actually took hold.

So according to my notes, Fallout kicked off for what we come from in early '94 when Interplay announced, "Hey, we're looking for an RPG license," and that's when I really... I want groups, I want groups, but GURPS is just a set of mechanics, it's not a set of rules. Steve Jackson came out in early '94 to see the company, see the people. We spent the whole day, it was super fun. We went to Club 33 up in Disneyland, it was a great day, we played Illuminati, someone corrected me on the rules. Anyway, in late that month, so this is still March of '94, I sent Steve Jackson Games a whole box of Interplay titles, so I said, "Okay, you've met us, you've seen the company, here's a lot of games we've made."

All I remember, because I don't actually have, you know, I don't have signed contracts, somewhere between then and June is when we got signed on. The only people assigned to the project at the beginning, it was me, I had a producer, Tom. All I know is by September, Tom was no longer assigned. He had had 22 different projects or project SKUs, as they're called, and he was swamped. So at some point, Allen Pavlish, the executive producer, just told me, "Just handle it, just take care of it." So with Tom off, it was just me, but I did find in June, I had forgotten about this, John M. Ford, the science fiction fantasy author who also loved role-playing games and was involved with SJ Games on some of their written materials, had sent us a proposal for setting because, remember, with GURPS, we just got mechanics.

I don't remember much about the setting. I do not have a copy of it, but I found a single line note I wrote in June of '94 that said Chris Taylor along with Tom Decker and myself had a phone call, we had a conference call with John M. Ford about his design for a non-linear time travel GURP CRPG. This is not the dinosaur time-traveling game we came up with later. It was a... I don't even remember, it was time travel and it was quite non-linear, not just because of it being a game but because that's the way he wrote the story. It was disjointed, I guess, as a different way of saying it, and it wasn't near the end that you could put all those pieces together and figure out what happened. We didn't go with that.

In August, I found a list of people I wanted on the team, and it mentioned that I wanted Jason Taylor, so that was end of August, and then the next note I have in September actually has him on the team. So sometime between end of August and September is when Jason Taylor and also Jason Anderson got assigned to the team, and those are the only people signed for the rest of '94. So all the rest of the stuff I'm going to talk about, where we got into setting, were people who were coming up with these ideas and doing the work on their own personal time outside of Interplay hours.

In fact, I found at one point, the art director of the company, Todd Camasta, asked me for an art list, and my list is still generic fantasy. It says crossbows, swords, medieval armors, and then environment, generic environments like forests and grasslands and deserts. I mean, this is, we have not thought about this game, whose engine was coming together. The sprite engine was coming together. We had not thought of a setting yet.

So later, this would be after early September but still in the fall, so be September or October, that's when I sent out that email saying, "Hey, if anybody wants to think about settings, show up at a meeting." Now here's where things got weird. I only remember two meetings, but my notes clearly say after four or five meetings, we had settled on, so we obviously had more of these. I did have a note saying I expected over a dozen people to show up, but there is only half that for the four or five meetings, so I was shocked that like, why are people banging down this conference room door wanting to make a new IP? Was because it was after hours, and we're gonna get paid for this.

The first meeting we had, we basically just wrote ideas, and I said anybody can throw out any idea. We're not going to critique it, but we will talk about the pros and cons of it as a setting for a computer game, and things like that. What we talked about is how easy would it be to tell stories in it and make quests for it. Is it evocative? Are there mysteries out there for the player to solve? Are there things for the player to do? But we're going to talk about

, that's a dumb idea. I didn't want anyone to do that. I just wanted to say, okay, what would we do with this? Somebody's brought an idea, we all chewed on it. What kind of game would we make with it?

The second meeting is when that weird dinosaur spaceship time travel idea came out. I described it in briefly in a previous video and also at the GDC talk I did in 2012. That was on the second meeting. It was bizarre, it was overly complex, and that was what most people, we chewed on, and then most people said, "That's too complicated," and then we cut it back to just aliens. And at one point, we were talking about a setting on future Earth that had been invaded by aliens, and humans were hiding in shelters all over the world. And I think that's when I said, well, you know, there's a ton of bunkers out there already. I knew about one in West Virginia that U.S. government officials would go to, and I said those are already existing, we could do that. From that, we kind of realized we liked the destroyed Earth setting but not so much the Alien Invasion setting. So that's when we settled on post-apocalyptic.

Keep in mind, there was no discussion of Wasteland, and I'll make it clear because apparently, no matter how much I say things, people don't really hear what I'm saying. They hear what they think I'm saying. In a previous video, I said some people have played Wasteland on the team, and some people hadn't, which led to a comment going, "I can't believe Wasteland wasn't an influence. They obviously played Wasteland." Yes, some people had played Wasteland, some people hadn't. Some people played Gamma World, some people didn't. They were influences on the game, but we weren't actually basing things. We weren't trying to pull things directly out of that game. It's very much a hodgepodge, as you will see as I do this video. It was no, there was no hard and fast rules. There was no directing vision early on.

So we went with post-apocalyptic by the end of the second meeting, and apparently, we had at least two more after that. The idea for a vault was mine, however, the name Vault came from Jason Taylor. I think I just said, "Hey, why don't we just go with a bunker?" I like the idea of someone coming out of a bunker not knowing what the world was like, just like the player. The idea of making it a big Vault, the backstory about Vault-Tec, all that came later.

Now, this is where it gets interesting because, remember, I just told you no one had been assigned to the project, and this is well before we had come up with... this is what the '50s are going to be like. I found a note from December of '94, and I'm writing about Junktown. Now, Junktown was Scott Campbell's idea, but he obviously hasn't been assigned to this yet. He was at those meetings, though, so he was obviously doing a lot of work, and I just tell you right now, if you like Junktown or the Hub or Necropolis, those were all Scott Campbell's. He had all these ideas very early on. Interestingly, he came on board in early '95, and by the fall of '95, he was gone. So I'll talk about that in a later video, but it was he had all these great ideas that you see in the Fallout that we actually shipped.

So sometime around then is when I put together a prototype map that was not the one with the knights walking around. I tried to make a prototype map that showed... let's see, I wrote down... this is in December of '94. I put together a prototype level to test features like walking around a map, melee combat, opening containers, and taking their loot. I believe it later got put out on a demo, I'm not sure. So this would have been just me, Jason Taylor, and Jason Anderson at the time. Jason Anderson was making all the art, Jason Taylor was, he'd come on to run the scripting, the scriptures we'd eventually get, and make a scripting language, but instead, I think he was making the world editor that we were using to put together the maps.

So we started talking more about post-apocalyptic, and that's when people came up with, you know, "Hey, we should do these things," or that. We really couldn't... Wasteland and these ideas that came from Gamma World, and like I mentioned in the video on influences, books, and movies, and video other video games, and tabletop games, these were all things that got smushed into Fallout, and you can see those influences in Fallout. You can see Rangers from Wasteland, you can see the leather jacket, which came from Mad Max, not '50s Greaser games. These pre-date Leonard's idea about making it a '50s-style game. The leather jacket was what Mad Max wore, which then led to someone wanting to put in the dog and calling it Dogmeat, which is what the main character in A Boy and His Dog referred to his dog as. Once, that wasn't his name; the name was Blood, but he called his dog Dogmeat. And then guns, people talked about guns, and I'm not... I don't have a lot of notes on this, but I know our guns came from everywhere. There were real-world guns, there were guns for movies. One of the guns came from Blade Runner; somebody liked the gun in there, we did it.

So now we're past '94 into early '95, and I know Leonard got assigned to the project somewhere around March of '95. Now, even coming to all those meetings and he had been doing after-hours work as well, but he was formally assigned in '95. Sometime later that year is when he came up with that idea of a rule to filter our ideas, which means for all that stuff meetings we had in '94 and for a big chunk of '95, we just threw things in that we liked: Junktown, ghouls, giant scorpions. I mean, these were things that you could see in any 1950s or later post-apocalyptic sci-fi horrors of nuclear devastation movie, but it was sometime in late '95 when Leonard had his epiphany driving about, "Hey, why don't we make this future what the '50s?" because we, a lot of our ideas came from those thought the future would be.

So suddenly we had a great rule for defining our architecture, our robots, what our tech would look like, and influence the music. I mean, that's why we look for that old-style music to open up with, even though we already wanted a more ambient sound for the game itself. I mean, when people talk about there were '50s music Fallout, was not riddled with '50s music everywhere. It was pretty much used in the opening and the closing cinematics.

So that's as close as I can come to recreating the origin of Fallout's setting. The nice way of saying it is, there's a very organic process. It was a

 melange, a blend. A worse way of looking at it was very haphazard. We just threw a bunch of stuff in, and what stuck is what we liked and we kept. Because of it, I hope how I describe this, you realize this is why it's really hard for me to point at an influence, and it's hard to say who's responsible for one feature because, like just from the name alone, you know, I'm sure there's somebody who was in those meetings who went, "I was the one who thought of the name Fallout." Yeah, but I'd say Brian Fargo is responsible for the game being named Fallout because of that. It's hard to say like, well, who thought of this robot, or who thought of this piece of armor, because there were a lot of armor, and I think even one robot design in the game before we went with the '50s aesthetic, but those things all kind of fit. But you can see some armor, like metal, that metal shoulder armor, spiked armor that you're like, "I don't remember seeing that in any '50s movie." You're right, that got thought of and put in before we ever thought of that aesthetic, but it still kind of fit with the whole fallouty vibe.

So I just want to say that the setting ideas came from many places, they passed through many hands, they eventually got filtered through Leonard's aesthetic, but there's a whole bunch of parts and individual features of the game that resonate with us, the people who made it, and also with you, the people who played it, and that vibe is partially what we put in and partially what you brought to it. And that's as close as I can come to a definitive, here's where Fallout's setting came from. That's why I like to talk to other people who worked on it; they can provide more insight, but that's as close as I can come to a timeline of the creation of Fallout's setting. Hope you found that informative.

The Origin of Reactivity.md

https://youtu.be/u0pJN3jpUjQ?si=r0aVM783OopR2jLj

Hi, it's me Tim. Today I want to talk about the origin of reactivity in my computer games. I had a lot of fun talking about the origin of dumb characters and the original flawed characters, and all this goes back to early tabletop games that I would play with friends and co-workers. Now, I already talked a little bit about reactivity when I talked about how when I was teaching groups at Interplay to people who never played, I made a single dungeon and ran three groups through it, and they all it all was wildly different, and people thought the dungeon was different. Now, it was a tiny six-room dungeon; it's just they were playing differently. Excuse me, and then turns out the origin of all this goes way, way back to early high school when I first started playing D&D. My main group I played with literally over a dozen different people, but my main group were three high school friends Joel, William, and Steve. They all played very differently, so I want to talk about each one of them, but there's a common theme here, and then they did things that I never expected them to do, and I just had react.

I talked about Joel's three dexterity cleric, a lot of fun with him, you know, when he was surprised, he was harder to hit, and he, this is the character that had to burn everything coming off of him. So eventually used a green slime pit to get rid of those things. Well, another aspect of his religion was he had to hide his Temple. So in the course of adventuring, they had come across an old Monastery with a couple dungeons below it, his ruins, the monasteries ruins on the surface, and the dungeons were full of monsters, so they cleared it all out. Joel decided that would be the greatest place for his Temple but not the first dungeon level; he put his secret temple on the second. They left the ruins on top alone, and then the dungeon, the first level dungeon, which was he considered the buffer, he made that into his own personal dungeon. He hired a thief and had the magic user in the party dimension door him in and out of the Temple, and the thief put up traps on the first floor. Then after the dimension door out, Joel went through and added extra glyphs of warding since he was a cleric, so now the whole dungeon level was trapped. Then he started seeding it; every time they'd go on an adventure and they'd find a cursed item, that went in there, his green slime pit, he made, he put green slime in different places in Dungeon first floor of the dungeon too as traps. It was such a wild floor that at one point, since he was the only one who knew it, he ran the other players through it as a dungeon level, and they just, they hated it. They said it was worse than tomb of wars, which if you've played, that's a trappy dungeon. So it's always really like he really liked that, but he finally got frustrated with only having a three dexterity, so he went on a quest to try to find gloves of dexterity, which when you put them on Boom, immediate 18 to dexterity. He asked his mentor, a really high-level priest in the same religion, if he knew of any, and he said, "I do, but they're very far away in these mountains, which are really treacherous to go through, and they're hidden away in a dungeon that's very treacherous." And Joel's like, "I'm gonna go get him." So he convinced the rest of the party to go; they went on this dangerous adventure; it was really, they almost got killed multiple times, but he got the gloves of dexterity, and he put them on, 18 dexterity, super happy. They head home, and they're not cautious at all; they just basically leave the dungeon and walk down the mountain. They get attacked by three Cloud Giants. One Cloud giant is hard enough, three, they do manage to defeat them, but a few people in the party die, including Joel's cleric. Now, remember, this is far away; they rushed to get him back to his mentor who could raise him, but they missed the deadline, remember Ray's dead only works for so many days. They missed the deadline by two days. So this high priest tells them, "I can do a resurrection, but it's very expensive, and I have to plead with the god to give me the spell, and I'll do it if you give me the gloves from the dead Clerk." I mean, Joel was upset, but what was the option? So yeah, he got the gloves, he got to wear them for about an hour, then he died, and then he got resurrected, and the price of the Resurrection with the gloves. What's interesting, that entire Quest was generated by me on his desire for gloves, never did find any clues on where to find any more, he ended up retiring that character, and he made a new character that was a magic user named Scaramouche, and he made Scaramouche completely unconscious. Scaramouche would open doors, open chests, dive down wells, and die, and they'd get him raised, and he'd die again, and they'd get him raised, and he'd die again. His character sheet was a tombstone with multiple dates on it. He finally died so many times he couldn't be raised anymore because there's a limit, one per point of Constitution. But a passing druid, very high level, agreed to reincarnate him, and he came back as a troll, and he's like, "Great, now I regenerate everything." A few encounters later, evil magic user Fireballs the troll; he doesn't regenerate fire. Scaramouche, um, the other two players, equally reactive stuff. Uh, William played a druid, and we got high enough, he made himself a treehouse, not too close to the monastery that Joel had. At some point, they encountered a sphere of annihilation and an amulet attuned to it that lets you move it around. He decided, wouldn't decided, that his Druid was so eco-friendly that they dug a pit next to the tree, put the sphere of annihilation in it, and then covered that with an outhouse. As if that wasn't enough, there was a pipe coming down, wooden, I'm sorry, wooden, used metal, wooden shaft that he threw trash in from different floors of the treehouse that would also go down into the sphere, and of course, the sphere was always available because William wore the amulet to launch at enemies; it would just burst out of the ground and absorb enemies, all clean and ecologically friendly. Then there was Steve, played an Illusionist. Now, he was, he was a long-running character, so he eventually got up to level 14, where he could alter reality, which is kind of like a wish, but every time he did that, he aged a few years, so he never did that; he was so cautious, he was so careful how he played his character. That group, and I let each of them by that point have two characters because that way they'd have six in the party instead of three, they encountered fire Giants, tough, you'd think they'd learned the

 lesson from the cloud Giants, no, they did not. They're fighting them; several people in the party die, in fact, I think four of the six died, and all that was left was William's druid and Steve's Illusionist. So the fight's over, four dead people, two living ones. Steve looks at the back of his character sheet and goes, "Huh, I had a potion of fire giant control." William's face just goes flat; he looks at me goes, "I kill Steve." I think I talked him off the ledge, but I don't think Steve realized how close he was to joining his four other party members in death. Now, these are all things that just happen, um, but it wasn't unique again to that group. Years later, I was in grad school, so in my early 20s, and I convinced uh, some neighbors and some friends of mine to play D&D with me. It was an interesting group; it was four women and two men, and they played D&D in a way I'd never seen before. I can only call it like super ultra cooperative. They shared everything; items went to the person who could use it the best, not necessarily the person who was next in line to get it. They, they would use, um, if a cursed item dropped, they'd figure out well, maybe someone can use it, and the curse won't be that bad for them. They found an item that lets you cast Fire, cast Firebolts, and be immune to Natural heat and cold, and resistant to magical heat and cold, but the curse on it meant you couldn't touch anything metal or plant related; it would eventually rust or just dissolve off you. Had a monk in the party, the monk took it; he wore leather pants, and I think that's all he wore. He fought unarmed, and he changing to shoot fire bolts. Now, a magical bow stick at one point dropped, and how rare is that, and he couldn't use it because it was made of wood. Um, he ate mostly meat; I rolled that he could eat vegetable material, but he went through a lot of utensils. But the group adapted in a way I've never seen; if after a battle, they'd all applaud each other when somebody did something great in battle, they'd they'd tell them how great they were. They would parlay with monsters and try to get them to join their group, and one time it worked; they ended up with a pixie in their group, very capricious little pixie that often got them into trouble, but they ended up loving it; it was like the the um group mascot. Now, what was interesting is I often wondered why this particular group was like that; maybe it was because it was mostly women, maybe it was because we were in our 20s, I wasn't playing with children anymore. But one of the things I thought was we're all in grad school, so we all spent all day either getting yelled at undergraduates in classes where we were teaching assistants or getting yelled at by professors in meetings where we were research assistants. So when we came to D&D that evening, we were done being yelled at by each other or anyone else, and it just became this nice let's have fun, and I think everybody bought into that. And I loved that; those D&D sessions had a totally different timber in tone. But they did like every group I ever played with, do things that I literally could not imagine. Catherine rolled a druid; she rolled a natural 18, but instead of putting in wisdom, she put it in charisma because she's like, "I'm going to be the most beautiful Druid anywhere." So the six of them are adventuring; they encounter an anti-palladin, Dirk, Dirk the merciless. He captured them, and he captured everybody, took all their stuff, threw them in the dungeon, but he said, "I will let your friends go," he said to Catherine's Druid, "I will let your friends go if you agree to marry me, Stay With Me." She was like, uh, now Dirk did have an 18 Charisma as well, but he was Pure Evil. But Catherine decided to do it; she said, "I'll do it, let my friends go, I'll stay with you," he goes, "Okay, I will." And they went off; he didn't let them go; they were still down in the dungeon rotting. She eventually found this out, but she didn't know what she could do; she had none of her items, she was kept in Dirk's Castle. She knew that his Patron was a demon, and she found out how he talked to the demon, so she knew there was a bowl, and somehow it summoned the demon. She used it, and the demon knew who she was and what was going on and pretended he appeared, but he said, "You have summoned this bowl doesn't summon a demon; it summons your Patron spirit, and I'm the spirit of the forest, and I will free your friends for you if you agree to give me your soul when you pass." She's like, what, and he's like, "We'll use it for the good of the forest; here's a contract to sign," and that's what it said, it said, "The next time you die, you won't be able to be raised, and your soul goes to this poor spirit." Catherine signed it. Of course, as soon as she signed it, the demon revealed himself, said, "I'm not a force Spirit, I'm Dirk's Patron demon, and I own your soul." And she was like, hmm, But you're you're do the other parts, he goes, "Hey, yeah, you signed it," and he snapped his fingers, and the party was removed from the dungeon. Catherine's Druid was with them; they had all their items back, and everything was good until Catherine's character discovered that she was pregnant with Dirk's child, and her first reaction was, "Hey, my magical leather says that it adjusts to people's size, so will it adjust and be maternity leather?" That was her concern. That started a whole series of side quests where occasionally Dirk would show up, and he's like, "I will have you back," and there were fights, and the demon would occasionally show up and go, "Don't forget me," it was a very strange campaign and unlike any I've ever run, but it was fun. And later on, I remember making video games and thinking, I've got a lot of lessons to learn here; one, players never do what you think; two, dialogue can be super fun and lead to some situations it's just fighting cannot lead to; that is a good thing to do. And three, players all have different ways of playing; they have different ways that they think are fun. Um, one of my groups loved building strongholds; one group loved being cooperative; one group was very competitive with each other; they all liked it, none of those were wrong ways to play. I just had I had to react to them; I didn't force them into a mode. It also meant I had to keep a ton of side quests around because I never knew what they were gonna do. I had lists of side quests; whenever I designed an area, I would

 often put other things in the area and see that well, there's a dragon up here, there's a cave of mystery over here, there's an evil Necromancer lair down here because I did not know if they were going to go to the dungeon. This really informed things like Fallout and Arcanum, which had world maps you could go across, and I had to make sure that those world maps are seated with a lot of other things that had nothing to do with the main story arc. I also wanted to move away from the Ultima, you're here to do good, you're here, and you have a goal, get it however you want, the game will react, and if you act badly, it will react badly, but I didn't like this idea of well, you're going to be a good character, you're here to be a hero, no, you're here to find a water chip, anyway you can, if it means killing everyone in Acropolis to get their water chip, great. So, these things informed all my later tabletop campaigns, all my later uh video games. So I think it's very important that people, if you want to be a game developer, that you keep yourself open, that you're going to learn a lot of things from the different stuff you do, and also, player characters will, players will be players, and you can't control that, so instead of trying to do that in an RPG, computer RPG, just let them do what they want. Ah, that was fun. Bye-bye.

The Origin of Recipes In My Games.md

https://youtu.be/wz96ELi0EjE?si=DGX3Q3drPjt-CCsF

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim. Today I want to talk about all those recipes that appeared in a lot of my video games. So for those of you who don't want to hear personal information from me, you can just skip this. There's not a lot of game development in it, you will be uninterested.

So all of this started with Stone Keep and a pumpkin muffin recipe, but I'll tell you a little bit about what led up to all that. 

So I grew up the youngest of five kids, and I never really learned to cook at home. My mom would cook a lot of food. I had an older sister who cooked a lot. I just never was asked to do any cooking. I didn't know how to cook. So when I went off to college, I knew nothing about feeding myself, which is fine because, you know, your first year, actually for me the first two years, I lived on campus, ate from the school cafeteria, and I lived. But my third year, I moved off campus and I didn't know how to cook.

But luckily, one of the guys I shared the apartment with, Jeff, was putting himself through school as a sous chef, and he could make the most amazing things. I mean, I'd come home and he's like, "I'm throwing together some trout almondine." I'm like, "Yeah." So I kind of wanted to supplement that food, so I started learning how to bake because baking is very different. Cooking is very you taste, you change the ingredients on the fly, you're... it's very... it's kind of like the Jazz of cooking. But baking is all measuring precisely, putting together, putting in the oven, very engineering, which is what I was doing, what I was studying. So I started doing that. It was good, made a lot of chocolate stuff. Chocolate was what I didn't do.

So a few years later, when I went off to grad school in California, I found myself baking a lot more. I didn't have a car my first year of grad school, and in California, if you don't have a car, you're not going anywhere. So I did a lot more baking. There was one month where I baked a different recipe every day. Anything that was left over, I took into school with me, or I gave it to my next-door neighbors, until finally one of them came over, Catherine, and begged me to stop dropping things off. She said, "We've gained weight since you've moved in, you've got to stop doing this." And I was like, "Okay." And then three days later, she and her roommate, Megan, came by to see if I had made anything. So that was funny.

I also, um, I started baking so much that Trader Joe's sold these big 10-pound blocks of Ghirardelli dark chocolate. I went to my local Trader Joe's and bought one, and then about a month and a half later, I went and bought another one, and I had the same cashier, and she didn't say anything. Then about two months later, I went and bought a third one, so that's 30 pounds, and she said, "I have to know, are you buying these as a gift?" And I said, "No, I'm... I bake with them. I bang a piece off, and I melt it, and I cook it." And she goes, "Wow." So yeah, it got noticed.

So I kept cooking a lot, or baking a lot. When I started at Interplay, I would always bring things in because I'd make something, and I didn't want to eat it all, so I'd bring it in, and people would eat it. And there was one thing that was really popular, the chocolate chip pumpkin muffins. They were from my friend Beth. She had a book of just muffin recipes, and she made it, and they were good, everybody liked them. But I'm not a big fan of ginger as a spice. I love pickled ginger next to my sushi, but I don't like ginger as a spice. And I found out my mom never used it when I was a kid. Her pumpkin pie recipe used just cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves, which is interesting because I hate cloves. Turns out, so does my mom. But she told me if you don't put a little bit of clove in, just a little bit, it doesn't taste right, which maybe the origin of flaws, because you need something a little wrong to make something really right.

So I redid the pumpkin muffin recipe from Beth's book, but in... I threw out all the spices that it used, and I replaced them with my mom's pumpkin pie spices. I also upped the chocolate chips a little bit because... they were really good. They were really good. And I started making those when I was at Interplay. I just bring them in.

So when Stone Keep was nearing completion, and I had done a little bit of work, I made a critical error handler for the CD reading algorithm. It had to be done in assembly, and I knew assembly, so... Chris Taylor wanted to put the recipe on the disc as a hidden file. And it was just recipe.txt, and it was... rewrote it to make it sound like, you know, "This is what the Shadow King eats." So it turned out it was pretty popular, people liked it.

So then when I was making Fallout, we wanted to put recipes in, and he put a taco salad recipe, and I put a recipe for mushroom clouds, which are little meringue cookies that look just like mushrooms. They're meringue caps and stems that are glued together with dark chocolate. That came from a recipe book for a chocolate Christmas Yule Log cake that you decorated with those mushrooms, and I thought the cake was eh, but cookies were really good. The mushroom cookies were great. So I started making those. One issue with them is it takes about six hours to make because you... you mix together meringue, takes about 20 minutes, and then you slow bake them at 200 for two hours, then they cool, then you snip the top of the stems, then you melt chocolate, then you have to glue them all together. The whole thing from start to finish takes about six hours.

I started taking them to a friend who had a Christmas party every year, big Christmas party, kind of a fancy Christmas party. I met the mayor of Newport Beach at that Christmas party, and I'd bring them, and she had it catered, and I'd give the cookies to the caterer, and they'd bring them out on trays. And the second or third year I did that, the caterers asked me for the recipe because they wanted to start including those cookies in other parties that they catered. But when I gave them the recipe, the... the head caterer, she looked at the recipe and went, "Six hours? We're not gonna do that." And he didn't. So, I think I took those cookies to my friend's Christmas party, I think, for 25 years, maybe a little more. I remember taking them when I still lived in a little apartment in Costa Mesa, so it's probably more like 27 years. So I included those as the Fallout,

 as the mushroom clouds in the back page of Fallout, with the picture of me holding a tray of them. In fact, over here is the original picture of me that T-ray drew.

So then the next game I made was Arcanum, and wanted to include a recipe in that, and I wanted it themed for Arcane, so I rewrote it, making it sound like it was a halfling recipe. And that was my mother's banana bread recipe, pretty much unchanged. I think... I think it might have a little cinnamon in it that her... the original one didn't have. I don't remember. And that was popular.

So for the next game, Temple, I wanted to put a recipe in that, and Atari pretty much said no, we're not... there's no room in the manual. We're not gonna waste time with this. So I did it as a file again. I think it was... I don't think it appeared in there, but it was written up as if an elf had found it, um, on an orc they killed, with half some parts, so obviously it was another halfling recipe. And that was for my chocolate chip cookie recipe. And that was a recipe I got from a secretary at UCI when I was a grad student. She was always giving me recipes for things which she found out how much I like chocolate. And that was a recipe. It called originally for like a cup of chocolate chips, and I upped it to a cup and a half, and then two cups, and then two and a half, and then three cups. I found out if you tried to put three and a half cups of chips in or more, there was so much chocolate that the cookie wouldn't hold together, and you'd end up with a puddle of melted chocolate with dough blobs in it. And I ate those, by the way. They were delicious, dough blobs. So I pulled it back to three cups. I called it chocolate chip cookies of the Gods because they were just fantastic. Those are the cookie recipe that you had to make the dough and refrigerated overnight to let the flavors mingle. If you didn't do that, it didn't taste as good.

And then I didn't do anything on Vampire because I wasn't on it for the first, you know, almost two years. Then at Carbine, I left before it shipped. And then when I got to Obsidian, I kind of felt that it wasn't appropriate to do it in like South Park or... or um, it just... it wasn't... I mean, I just came out as a programmer, and it wasn't anything I was involved in, and I didn't have anything to theme. But then when Pillars got kick-started, and the reaction from the public was really amazing, and we started adding in all these goals, I think it was Josh came to me and said, "Hey, would you do recipes?" And I was like, "Recipes plural?" And I think I ended up picking 10 to 12 recipes, um, ranging from super simple like egg salad, so if you could boil water and hard boil eggs, you can make this, up to some more complicated recipes. And that all got put together in a Pillar's Eternity cookbook that became a higher tier reward. And I thought that was pretty cool. Um, also Josh rewrote that... we wrote my recipes to be more thematic of the Pillars universe, and I thought that was really fun.

And then I... I didn't do it for Outer Worlds. Outer Worlds had a recipe in it for the concentrated distillate. I've tried to trace down where it came from because Bree, the artist who put it in the game, she thought it came from me. So we went to her boss, Don Alpert, the art director, and he also thought it came from me, and it did not come from me. And then later on, I saw Greg make it on the YouTube channel, How to Drink. And I was like, "I don't know where this came from." I literally don't know where that recipe came from. So I mean, if anybody figures it out, let me know because apparently it was somebody traced it down to something used in a con called Apple something, but it... the recipe is a little different. So I don't know where it came from.

And so I've kind of stopped doing that. Also, I switched off carbs a few years ago, so I have adjusted some of these recipes to be low carb, and they pretty much switch over. But anyway, that's kind of the origin of where all these recipes came up in the games I made. You can find them online. I was going to try to put them in the comment section, but the recipes are way too long for what will fit in the description of the... of this video. But I'm sure you can find them online if you Google the game and the recipe.

Anyway, I hope you thought that was fun.

The Origin of VATS.md
Youtube Link:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4FXXZILWnY

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim. Today, I want to talk about the origin of VATS in Fallout, and I'll start by saying we didn't call it VATS in Fallout 1 and 2. That's a Fallout 3 term, but it's just what everybody calls it now. And this is me answering a question from Vladimir in Germany, who asks, "I always wonder how this feature that was later known as VATS came to be. Where did it come from? What problem did you try to solve? What benefit did it give to the player?"

This is a good question. I really like this question because it's an example of a question that in a million years, it wouldn't have occurred to me to do a video on because I kind of thought people knew this. And then I remember like how much about the nitty-gritty and history of Fallout that while it may have been mentioned somewhere in an interview 20 years ago, a lot of people just don't know today.

So, I'll try to go through and answer all of Vladimir's questions in detail. First of all, where did it come from? If you didn't know, Fallout was originally going to be a GURPS product, meaning it was going to use GURPS, the role-playing game as its system. We switched over before it shipped, about probably in February, and it shipped in October, so eight months before it shipped, we switched over to SPECIAL.

Now, GURPS had a feature called called shots that let you aim at a part of an enemy, and at a risk of a penalty to hit that area, or if they were more heavily armored in that area, a different damage resistance or damage threshold depending on where you were hitting, at the advantage of the potential advantage of either doing more damage or causing an effect.

Now, the GURPS code, the GURPS combat code in Fallout, was written very modularly. It was written in modules. How do I know that? I wrote it. Before we even were doing Fallout, I had made a GURPS character creator that ran just as its own application, and it had a lot of modules that were external text files that you could read in. So, you could say, "Hey, I want these advantages and disadvantages and these skills and this is the tech level," and all the stuff you could do.

When I started making Fallout, I wrote the combat code the exact same way. The game was kept separate from the game mechanics, and the game mechanics were GURPS; it was this set of skills and these rules for how they were used. But that's not how combat worked. Combat was a like a turn-based combat engine that, when it needed to know how far can I move, what actions are legal, if I use this weapon on this person what's my chance to hit and how much damage will I do, and what effects will I have, those were called from the game into the game mechanics, the module supporting the game mechanics.

So, when we switched from GURPS to SPECIAL, I extracted all those GURPS modules and just put them somewhere else. That meant we had to make our own system, and we did—traits and skills and perks. When we did all that, I wanted to keep the called shot system because even though our sprites were 2D, they were made at 3D models and then extracted into game data as sprites. So, basically, they were rendered walking in all eight directions and some of them four—no, we didn't do reflection into Arcanum. So, we did—and oh, it's only six because it's GURPS. Fallout was in hexes.

So, we would render these models out walking and doing their actions as 2D sprites, but we had 3D models, and in our called shot UI, we had this really cool thing where we'd wireframe the model and then point to different parts of it as places you could shoot. I wanted to keep that. So, as part of the new SPECIAL system, we allowed called shots. So, that's where it came from, it came from GURPS.

What problem were we trying to solve with it? We wanted the—we wanted to keep called shots because a) it made combat more tactical and more interesting, but it also allowed us to differentiate weapons and armor from each other because we had armor that protected you better in some areas. We had weapons that had different bonuses and penalties for shooting in different areas. So, these are things that we wanted to keep. And also, there were traits and skills and perks that we wanted—we wanted to leave open the possibility of those affecting called shots because it made an interesting character to have someone who, "I don't hit as often, but when I do, I get more criticals," or, "I believe there was a trait that said you don't get called shots, you get more action points, but you can't do called shots." Okay, you know, that's an interesting thing to put in the game.

Called shots, therefore, the problem we were trying to solve is, how can we make weapons and armor and creatures and perks and skills and traits have more differentiation and more things that they provide as tactical decisions for a player to make in combat? And then finally, what benefit did it give to the player?

The clever player, when playing Fallout, will take advantage of all these differences and when fighting a particular type of enemy, will either start doing called shots in different locations or switch weapon types altogether, knowing that this isn't very good against this type of enemy. And we wanted that in there so that if you just wanted to play the game brute force and not think about those things, it was possible, but did the game get easier if you took those things to advantage? Yes. For example, the BB gun really was great for shooting people in the eye. That was the whole point of it.

But one thing that I didn't realize that just came out of how the numbers worked after we put the game together was one of the producers discovered that you could punch a lot of people in the head, and it not only—it there was less of a chance of hitting them, but when you did hit them, it tended to knock them down or knock them out a lot. So, one thing he discovered was if you upped your unarmed skill really high, you could go up and punch people in the face, and you would often knock them down or knock them out. And that worked on robots too. He thought was so funny. He said he called it the "glass jaw phenomenon." And he said, "I was surprised to find out how many robots had glass jaws." Like, these robots that were ripping through them normally, he would just run up and punch them in the face.

And I'm like, "This is great." I didn't take that out because what I loved about that was the idea that a player will feel clever because he is being clever and find some advantage like that in the game. I love—so while there's a lot of things in the game that bring that dimension of discovery, called shot did it in a great way because while they were a penalty to hit, they often increased your chance of doing a critical, and they added effects to what the critical would be. So, hitting someone in the eye greatly increased your chance of blinding them,

 hitting them in the head knocked them out, hitting in the leg crippled the leg.

So, while you had a chance of doing that randomly if you hit them without using a called shot, you had a much, much higher chance of doing it specifically with a called shot, and that made sense. And of course, since it's an isometric game, we didn't really have the option to let people aim at body parts the same way it would be if it was a first-person game. So, thanks, Windows.

So, this is something that I thought called shots added a great deal to the game, which is why I never wanted to lose them. So, I hope, Vladimir, that this answers your question on where called shots came from, what we were trying to do with it, and what benefit we thought it gave to players.

The Six Demos Of Fallout.md
Youtube Link:
https://youtu.be/dDvZTNoGAJw?si=EjXBUDUb-eP-cOw7

Hello everyone, it's me, Tim. Today I want to talk about these six demos of Fallout. Someone left a comment, uh, last week and asked about something about the Fallout demo, and I almost said, "which one?" because I remember just doing a couple. Remember, this is we're going on almost 30 years ago that Fallout started. It started in '94. And I could remember a couple, but you know, I've taken all my notes for Fallout, all the paper notes from Fallout are now digitized. So, I have 86 pages of notes, and this is with not one note per page, this is them compressed, you know, some of them are just a single line, it's something I've written down, you know, to remind myself what to say when I went into a team meeting. Some of them were things that I wrote down in a journal when I'd go home and I'm like, "oh, this today was a bad day," or "today was a great day." So, I was curious if I had information about the demos we made, and I did. The word "demo" appears 42 times in that 86-page document, and it turns out we made six demos over the development of Fallout.

This is an interesting video today because to really understand it, there are three other videos that you should watch first: the one I talked about the creation of Ganahl, the OS abstraction Library; the one I did on randomness; and the one I did on crunch because all of these come together. This is a good example of a video that will make more sense if you know the context of a lot of things I'm talking about. So, I'm going to walk through all six demos.

The first one was purely internal. We made it in November of '95. It was requested by, um, the admin, by the way, all the rest of the demos were requested by marketing. So, we made it in November of '95. Remember, we'd only been working on this maybe a little over a year, um, year and a half if you count, you know, the six months I was by myself, which, yeah, you probably should. So, a year and a half. I looked at my notes on this. I had three notes about this demo, so I don't even remember what area of the game we picked, and I don't think we did. I think we made a unique map for it because I know we wanted to show the flamethrower off. Alan Pavlish, the executive producer, the only note I have is, "complained it runs too slowly." I'll do a video on optimization. This was way, way too soon into a game's development to even thinking about optimization, so I just wrote that down. I didn't plan to act on it for at least another year. We also showed it to a reporter from Next Gen magazine, and I didn't write down their name, but I did write down they said they loved it, "when is this coming out?" and I was like, "years." So, I don't know who that was. Um, I do have a note that Brian Fargo liked it, and he said that the death animations were especially good, which is interesting considering that that was one of the things that, uh, Steve Jackson games originally liked and then later claimed that they thought were too over the top in the game.

So, the second one, and this is the other one I remember. I remember making two, this is one of them. We made one in May of 1996. So, this would be about six or seven months after the last one. We made it for E3, and what was especially exciting about this demo is it was both a playable demo and a self-playing demo. This is where having to watch a couple of my previous videos because I'm just gonna gloss over stuff. If you remember what I said about Ganahl, the OS abstraction library, that was responsible for writing everything out on the screen but also was took in all the input. It took in Mouse input, keyboard input, it could do joystick input if you wanted it to. All this stuff went into Ganahl's input event system. Turns out it was very simple for me to record those inputs. I could do timestamps of when they came in and what the input was. So, it was very easy to make it all play back that recorded input. I thought this would give us a self-playing demo, but I forgot random numbers. So, you may play it again, like let's say you were playing and you shot someone, and they died, and then you went to replay that level from the recording, you'd shoot them, but maybe you rolled a lower damage, and they didn't die. So, I fixed that by when Ganahl was told to begin a recording, it generated a random seed, save that at the very beginning of the recording, and seeded the random number generator with it, so from then on, that random number generator created a deterministic list of pseudo-random numbers, and this worked great. I remember we had, uh, two maps in this demo. I didn't write down which two they were, but I said I had two maps, and it showed off the cool features, and these are the features I wrote down that we showed off: talking, bartering, killing people, and finding interesting items. I know it was a mini-adventure where the players asked to go kill some rat scorpions in exchange for some items, so it might have been Shady Sands, but it might have been Junktown, and then we had a rad scorpion cave. And then, when you came back and turned in the quest, they gave you some really cool items. This was intended for people who wanted to play for more than 30 seconds because we found a lot of people would walk up, play for about 30 seconds, and then walk away. If they continued, they got this quest, and they could go off to another map on it. This also let us test, uh, our newly integrated script engine, so that was really cool. We got good feedback from that. There were bugs, but that's great. I mean, we've still got another two years to make this game or a year and a half.

The next one was made just a few months later, in July of '96, for another conference called ECTS. Uh, we wanted to just use the old demo, but marketing told us no, it has to be all new because editors were coming. I have no more information about this demo. Don't know what we made, don't know what feedback was. If I was told any feedback, I didn't write it down. All I know is we lost a few weeks to all of these. I'll talk about that in a minute.

The fourth one was a non-interactive demo that was made for Computer Gaming World in August of '96. Now, at some point, and it was either this or the next one, we decided to, instead of pre-recording the input and playing it back in the engine, that we would ship it as a movie, I think an AVI back then. This was decided, I mean, back then, games were pretty small, and the data we need to ship with was pretty small, and movies weren't that small,

 so we had to make an, uh, decision on, depending on how long it ran, if it was a long-running non-interactive demo, it was cheaper to actually send the game with the, the bit of art that it needed and the pre-recorded input than it was to create a movie. But movies played more consistently, um, frame rate and all that despite your hardware, so it was either this one or the next one that we went to Pure AVI for the non-interactive movies. But this was the one, and this is important, this fourth demo, which was in Computer Gaming World in August of '96, was the first time that Fallout was described as a spiritual successor to Wasteland. That's where they caught it on the CD. I do not know whether this came from us or whether it came from marketing or whether Computer Gaming World did that, but I'm 99% sure that it didn't come from us. The team, by this point, we weren't calling ourselves any kind of sequel or successor to Wasteland. We had gone off in our own direction, and we tried not to use that terminology because we thought it would build Foss in people. I was right because this happened later in, in, you know, we made Arcanum, and it was from this, people who gave you Fallout, we made Outer Worlds, just the people made Fallout. People generate a bunch of preconceived notions from that, but every time it's what marketing wants to do, and if you think as a manager, I have a lot of control over marketing, and you may be wrong. Also, I want to point out that this one, this fourth demo, was almost entirely made by my assistant producer, Fred Hatch. In fact, I had a note, "This demo would not have been possible without the heroic efforts of Fred Hatch." So, he pretty much played the game repeatedly until he got good, a good playthrough, and then that was either, you know, a re, uh, done as a Ganahl recording or an AVI. I don't know.

However, um, the next one, the fifth demo, was another non-interactive demo which was made in October of that year, so again, a couple months later. This one wasn't AVI. I don't have notes on what it was used for, but I do have a note saying, "I've put my foot down on no new demos. I've told marketing, 'use what you have, we're trying to make a game here.'" They were mad. They were like, "you don't understand," and I'm like, "you don't understand, every single time we have to make a demo, we lost weeks, sometimes a couple weeks. For one of them, I list eight weeks being lost in our schedule because none of these demos were planned. Nobody told me in 1994 you're gonna be making six demos." And if you think I had any say in these, I was like, "we're not making any more." That lasted for about six months because we made one more demo. This is the one everybody talks about when they say, "did you play The Fallout demo?" even though there were five before this, and they were available publicly, well, except the internal one. The one that people are usually talking about is the one that we put online in April of '97. We made an interactive, fully playable demo. It worked on PCM on both DOS and 1985, and we had a Mac version, so there's really three demos. We also put the opening cinematic movie because we got that done pretty early, and if you had the demo and the movie, then when you ran the demo, it would also play the movie before it went into the demo. Otherwise, you could play the movie by itself. The map was Junktown, pretty much laid out the same if not similar, but the story was completely unique, and we did that for a number of reasons. We didn't want to give away any of the storyline that was going to be in the game. Also, since the, uh, quest, we, we wanted you to go on had to be on that map. We didn't want to include a lot of other maps because we were trying to make this demo as small as possible because it was going to be downloaded. I think our goal was 20 meg or smaller. Um, so we, we made our own storyline so we could reduce maps and art, which was what took up all the space. A week after we put it up, we made another non-violent version, and ostensibly, this was so it could go to countries where our game was deemed too violent, but the other reason we did it was the non-violent version had far fewer death animations, which reduced the size again. Keep in mind, some of the death animations, people would explode, or they'd run on for a while. They were long. They were, they added to that 20 meg of size we had.

So, one last thing I want to talk about is how doing these demos added to our crunch. I'm not going to say that this was the only source of crunch in Fallout. There were a lot of sources of crunch, but this certainly was a big source. We made six demos, none of which were planned, and none of which I was told about when I started. By the way, I was never trained, never received one training, uh, lesson on how to manage a project, how to manage a team, how to be a leader, how to do project management in, um, oh God, there was a, Oh, that was called Microsoft Project, which was a nightmarish program that supposedly let you track tasks and stuff. I, it, things have gotten way better lately. But let me tell you that every single time one of these demos was brought up to me, it was urgent and important, um, and I was told it had to be done. I had no, no say. It wasn't until the fifth demo that I think is when I put my foot down and said, "these have to stop." What killed me was months later, sometimes after we had done several of these demos, when I would have a meeting with my boss or my boss's boss, and I said, "yeah, the schedule has been impacted by these demos," they're like, "no, no, you can't, you can't do that. These demos are required, but yeah, you, it, you can't let it delay the game." And I'm like, "how am I supposed to do it?" I was told to deal with it. So, part of the reason, you know, I wanted to talk about demos is if you go back and look at the video on Ganahl and the video on Randomness and the video and crunch, these six demos are an indication of a perfect example of all those videos. The Ganahl really helped us in tight, you know, spots like having to make a non-interactive demo. How Randomness came into play because I thought just playing back the same input wouldn't that give you the same playthrough? No, because of Randomness. And how crunch is just sometimes out of my control. I was the top most manager inside the team of Fallout, yet I could not control for things like demos. You know,

 you could, you could say, "well, we should have just not made them." Well, why don't you go on MobyGames and look at the number of Interplay games that had a producer that's only mentioned one time. Those were producers who tried to Buck that system, and they went away. So, there were sources of crunch that were beyond the control of the team, and they happened at levels above us, and not direct managerial levels. So, somehow, marketing was allowed to say, "spend eight weeks to make a demo," but "we're not gonna be responsible for your budget or your schedule. Deal with it."

Anyway, um, I hope you guys like just, uh, this bit of history about how there were six demos about Fallout.

The Trials of The Temple of Elemental Evil.md

https://youtu.be/t4718r53zAs?si=TDSEVdw5uSIitfxs

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim.

So by now, I've talked about Troika's games Arcanum and Bloodlines. I've even talked about the secret DOD project, and I've talked about our demos for Lord of the Rings and for our post-apocalyptic game, Epic. I've not talked about Temple, so let's talk about Temple.

Temple is Troika's worst scoring reviewed game. I think it's the worst-reviewed game of my career. I kind of want to explain how it became that, and for people who think I'm just gonna give excuses, this is an explanation. Just so you know, everything I'm going to talk about is either the result of a bad decision I made or because of a contract that I read, agreed to, and signed. So I'm to blame for all this. Let's get that out of the way, and now let me talk about what actually happened when we were making it.

So towards the end, actually after Arcanum, we started working on Journey to the Center of Arcanum, and then that didn't happen, and so we started doing Lord of the Rings, and that didn't happen. It was early 2002. Troika was approached by both Activision and Atari. They wanted us to make license games, Vampire or D&D, and they wanted all three of the principals, Leonard Borowski, Jason Anderson, and myself, signed on as key men. We thought it would be smarter to do both, so we wouldn't have all of our eggs in one basket. So we divided into teams. Leonard and Jason did Bloodlines, and I went on Temple. That meant also we had to hire; we Temple got some people from Arcanum, Vampire took the bulk. I had to hire up a bunch of new people, but the contract, and I'll get to it, wasn't for a lot of people, so it wasn't like I had to staff up, you know, 20 or 30 people.

So that was probably where things started to go awry because I didn't have Leonard and Jason to work with. I figured I would do the design because Steve Moray was going to handle the code, and not only system design but narrative design. And what did I base this brilliant idea on? Well, I wrote a lot of journal and lore content in both Fallout and Arcanum, things like the FEV being a Byron. I just, I wrote all that from scraping together biology classes and some reading. I also wrote the intro, the Fallout, the whole "war never changes" thing, which really resonated with people. So I thought, wow, I'm not a good writer. No, turns out Ron Perlman could read the phone book, and it would be good.

So we dove into, or I should say I dove into contract negotiations with Atari. They wanted us to do it in 18 months, which is super fast. Let's compare, Fallout New Vegas, the far superior game, was also made in 18 months. It had over twice as many developers on it, using an engine that already had the system mechanics coded in, although they changed some, and a lot of art provided. We were using the Arcanum engine that we modified for the Lord of the Rings game, so it already had pre-rendered backgrounds, but we were going to, for Temple, add 3D characters for the player characters, all the NPCs, and the creatures. Plus, we had to do all the system mechanics for D&D version three, class spells, monsters, all of it. I asked if we could drop Druid and Bard classes because they're a little weird, they have a lot of special abilities. I think I also asked for Paladin, but my notes say Druid and Bard. Atari said no, had to be all of it. That was one of the first mistakes I made with the contract, but not the last.

So I said okay, let's do that. They told me I could pick whatever module I wanted, and I let nostalgia blind me. I have been playing D&D since I was 14. I really wanted to do a Gygax module. Greyhawk wasn't represented among other D&D modules. I loved Temple of Elemental Evil. I picked that one. They were like, okay. The advantage that was they, you know, WotC published it, they should agree to everything that's in it. I was wrong. Should have put that in the contract, my mistake.

So we started doing it, and by the way, several people that we ended up hiring had never played D&D. So I started doing a Wednesday afternoon session for about a month or two to teach everybody D&D. And I made up something, just it was Duke sends you to pick up an ancestral tapestry from his old home, and there are bandits there, and it turns out one level's haunted, and then there was something horrible in the basement, and bandit leader escaped with the tapestry, and you had to chase him down to a necromancer lair. Several people on the team, after Temple shipped, said, "I wish we had done that one and not Temple of Elemental Evil because that one was a lot of fun."

The problem with Temple is I picked it without knowing anything about what our engine was going to be able to do. So we started working on the game, and I'd be hired up people, and we'd just dove in real quick, and we coded for D&D 3.0. In the middle of development, right smack dab in development, WotC is like, "Oh yeah, we're gonna be coming out with 3.5." And I was like, "Did you know this? You must have known this when we started." No answer. "We really think it would be better if this was 3.5 instead of three." And I'm like, "I need more time." I asked for three months; they gave me two. I agreed, even though there's a lot of changes between three and a half and three.

So we did that. That was almost about the time we hit the idea of how are we going to let the player pick alignments because it would be really weird to have like an assassin and a paladin in the same player party. Having an assassin NPC join is very different than the player having a lawful evil assassin and a lawful good paladin. So we came up with the idea of a group alignment, that you picked a group alignment, and then you had to pick alignments that were within one step of that, and that would prevent paladins and assassins in the same group. And then that meant I wanted to make a vignette, one vignette for each one of the nine alignments that kind of explained the reason that particular group was coming to Hamlet, the starting village. This idea, I don't think this is a good idea, but it was too late. I should have nixed it, but I didn't, because I get hooked onto good ideas. Ask anyone who's ever worked with me. I like sink my teeth into him like, "No, we have to do this, you know, the sky will fall if we don't have this one idea."

So we did them. I really wanted them to be an hour each. They were what, a few minutes tops? Shouldn't have done

 that. Then remember, now we went an 18-month milestone to 20-month milestone. In month 16 of 20 months, WotC came to us and said, "We've approved stuff in previous milestones, but now we're retroactively unapproving them." Some of the things they unapproved were names of NPCs from the original module, but that was easy to change. The two things that were the hardest things to change were they wanted children to being vulnerable. That turned out to cause a lot of issues because there are a lot of rules about what in D&D about what other characters can affect combat, and I'm not just talking about—I mean, it would be trivial to just say they don't fight and they don't take damage. But then if you were standing here, a child does it provide cover from a ranged attack? If you're doing a cleave, and there are some children near you, do they count towards the number of people standing near you for the cleave because you have to have so many withstand within you to do the cleave? So I don't know. There was just a number of things that we were like, "I don't know how we're going to keep the children in there and then find all the special cases where NPCs are counted or covers computed or anything." So what we ended up doing was just turning them off. Yes, there are some dialogues that reference kids like their kids playing in the front yard. There are no children in the front.

But the biggest problem with unapproving is we had already done a lot of content for Nulb that was approved, and they said no, take it out. That is why Nulb has buildings you can't enter. Nulb seems shorter than it should be. The, there was a brothel there. The entire brothel just had to be removed. There were so many changes to dialogues and quests and characters that we just—it would have taken too long to completely rewrite it, so we just sealed it up.

So that was bad. Then I think about two months later, so about month 18, I was playing a bard. Actually, I made a group of all halfling, all bard, and I was running into a lot of bugs, like from the get-go. So I contacted the publisher's QA department, and I asked them why they had not seen these because I gave them a test plan of test these classes, test these races, test these abilities, go to these encounters because these monsters have some special abilities that need to be tested. And their answer was, "Yeah, we don't like playing bards. We haven't played them." If any of you are feeling déjà vu, because I know I've talked about this in interviews elsewhere, the exact same thing happened on Bloodlines a year later when I found out their QA wasn't really testing the Nosferatu clan.

So anyway, we asked them to start testing those things. I believe Temple shipped with a really bad bug involving bards, and it was oh yeah, if you were on a map and you transitioned while one of your bard songs was playing, you would get to the next map, but after that point, any transition after that point would crash. And I remember people online were like, "Well, you must have not played bards." I'm like, "No, I just always turned off my bard songs before I transitioned."

So another thing that happened starting a few months before we shipped, and I don't think I've ever talked about this publicly, everybody at Troika knows this happened. So a few months before we shipped, I got a kidney stone. Now, if anybody here had a kidney stone, you know that it is mind-numbing pain, like body racking. When I was at the hospital that night when the pain started, I had a nurse who, they were preparing me for an emergency CT, she said, "If it's a kidney stone, I want to let you know I've had three children and a kidney stone, and I'd rather have another child than another kidney stone. That pain is unbearable." And I'm like, "I know."

So the CT confirmed I had a kidney stone. I was sent home. Most people pass a kidney stone in a day or two, maybe a week. Mine took four months, and it hurt the entire time. I couldn't function. I had to go back to my doctor and say, "I need a very strong painkiller. I'm in body-racking agony, like Star Trek, the original show, pain booth agony." And he gave me painkillers because he said, "Yeah, these are bad." The painkillers were so strong that I couldn't drive once I took one. So what I did is I'd go into work very early in the morning with my dog. I'd bring my dog to work, and I take a painkiller immediately, and then about 30 minutes or an hour later, I start working, work all day, drive home, take another one, let that effect hit me. I could have dinner, often went back to work on my home machine because there was a lot to do on Temple, and then right before bed, I take another one, and that would let me sleep. This went on for four months. Multiple people on my team and the Vampire team started getting concerned. I heard at one point they were thinking about doing an intervention. The painkillers adjusted my personality. They adjusted my work output. Again, I'm not saying this is an excuse. It's my work output, but it is an explanation. I don't think Temple was my best work, especially at the end. Excuse me.

So the kidney stone, finally, one morning, I was at work, was like any other morning, got in early, hardly anyone was there, came out. I was so excited. I was running around the office with it on a napkin. It was seven millimeters. For people who are wondering, that's a big one. The only people in the office were Long Win, an artist who I later worked with at Carbine and Obsidian, and Daniel Alpert, who was an intern, who later was our art director on The Outer World. I ran up to them, holding a napkin with my kidney stone in it, so proud, so happy. The pain was gone. They didn't even want to look at it. Mean. Can you believe it? They did not want to look at my kidney stone. So I took some pictures of it, called my doctor, they told me to come in, and then they wanted it. I'm like, "Well, I want it back." The nurse was like, "Why would you want this?" I'm like, "I made it. Took me four months to make it. I want it." She said, "No, we're going to do a destructive test." Came back, a calcium stone, the standard.

But by then, I believe it came out either right when we shipped or right after. We were still working on patches, by the way. And this is the other, jerry on the sundae, Draco worked on many patches, many more than ship. I know there were at least two patches that did not get shipped. The reason for this was our contract stated every patch had to be approved by the publisher.

 The publisher had decided they didn't want to pay for any more QA. Without QA, they wouldn't mark a patch as official, so we weren't allowed to put it out. We asked if we could pay for QA. They said no. We asked if we could put out an unofficial patch, just from Troika. They said no. Somehow this got out in the wild, you know, people found out, and it got perverted into, "Well, Troika won't make patches unless Atari pays for them," which made us look horrible, and I couldn't say anything about it. It was horrible. By the way, this would happen again on Vampire.

So I know this has—I think that that's pretty much most of them, most of the explanations. I know this is a bit more of a negative video than I normally do, but let me tell you, I learned some lessons from all this. And Leonard Borisk and I talk about this a lot, that you learn more from the failures of your games than the successes. Successes really don't teach you anything. Like, "Oh, people like that," but you don't know why. When people don't like something, you know why. So I walked away from Temple, and I learned two things. One, I'm a terrible businessman. I should not be allowed to read or sign contracts. And two, I'm really not that good of a writer. As I learned later with Outer World, I can write really good shorts. You need a lore for that item, I'm your man. You want a character dialogue, I am not your man. You want a quest idea? Do you want hundreds of quest ideas? I literally made 100 quest ideas for Arcanum and put them in a file for people to use. But you want me to, and you want me to write the quest for the log, I can do that. You want me to write characters that talk to you about the quest? No.

So I learned a lot from Temple, and I actually, I like the game. It's fun. It feels like D&D, and it's so pretty. It's so beautiful. I think Temple has gorgeous art. Yeah, the quests aren't that good. The dialogue's not that good, and the combat spaces are a little tight, but I like it. So I hope—I know some of you like it, some of you don't. I hope this video gives you some insight into what actually happens during development, both in and out of control of the developers.

Thanks.

Thoughts On A Fallout Remake.md
Youtube Link:

https://youtu.be/hUrNahAr5ho?si=IZgtHfoZ03YpcZv2

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim. Today I want to answer a question from Evan Shantlin, who, full disclosure, worked on QA on Fallout. Evan asks, "Hey Tim, ever thought about what changes or updates you'd like to see in a Fallout remake? Would you want a fully explorable map or base building added to the game? Are there areas you'd like to see completely reworked or just fleshed out?"

That's a good question, Evan. Let me just say right off the bat, I don't want base building. I understand why people like it. I understand why people put it into Fallout 4. I don't want that. In fact, let's define "remake" before I get started. I don't want to make a completely new game. If it's a Fallout remake, I think it should be the same game, just better and more modern: get rid of the bugs, get rid of the stuff we didn't have time to finish or add the stuff we didn't have time to finish, get rid of a lot of the frictional parts that are not considered fun challenges in today's modern world.

So let me go over what I would like to do because I made a list. First of all, I think an explorable map would be great. I would add something like procedural generation, similar to what I did in Arcanum, so you could drop into anywhere in the map, you could go into the mountains, you can find caves, you could find old ruins. So it would be like that procedural generation but better. In addition to just forest and grassland and stuff, I would add procedurally generated ruins, caves, stuff along freeways and roads that you just come across and be like, "Oh, this is something fine," kind of like some of the random encounters already are, but I'd leave the random encounters in. I think those are fun.

I would improve both the UI and the AI, and for the UI, I'm just saying there are tons of ways to make that UI better, not just adding extra digits for moving stuff over and barter, but just cleaning it up, making it easier to do things with mouse and keyboard than we did in the original. And also, I've talked about improvements in AI, especially for the companions, so I won't go into detail about that, but just gonna say that would definitely make it into a remake.

The next thing I would do was bring in a lot of the original artists and redo the art. I don't want it to be different; I want it to be much higher detailed. And this is a lot different than just upresing it. We had some of the stuff done in a higher resolution, so when we ran our art tool to turn the 3D art into sprites or textures for the UI, we lost a lot of detail. Would like to put all that detail back. Yeah, that could be done with the tool, but some of the art was done knowing that stuff would be lost in the conversion, so I would want that art to be redone so it looked better in high resolution.

I would also want to add creature respawning to the world. I really wanted that to be a universal thing. There were some maps that if you went in and killed everybody on it, or killed enough people on it, or killed the leader on it, you would come back and later find that other people were there, but I want respawning to be something that happened nearly everywhere, that you know, you kill everyone in a town, you come back, maybe bandits live in the town now, you kill the bandits, you come back, maybe there's just rad scorpions wandering the streets. I would want that to happen so that you saw the changes you were happening, you were forcing on the world, you saw those changes happen.

Related to that, I'd probably increase the level cap. Well, let me rephrase that, I'm sure I'd increase the level cap. I might even be talked into removing it. In general, infinite level caps bother me because it basically means you can make your player character end up being anything, have every skill and every perk and everything. It just makes the game a little too easy, and it removes any decision making on you for do for playing a certain way because well, my character is good at speech, or my character's good at stealth, or my character is good at combat. Now you're good at everything. But I could be talked into doing it, and maybe since that's only a high-level thing, if that's what people want to do, maybe it's something you optionally select as an option.

I would definitely add more reactivity to the game. I wish that people reacted more to the armor you were wearing or the weapons you were using, to the companions you have, to things you've said, the things you've done. In fact, all your past actions. We did a lot of that on Arcanum. I would like to roll that back into Fallout and just make people far more responsive to the player.

I would also like to make changes to maps during play. We often had things where I would say, what happened to, for example, what happened in Necropolis after you took the water chip? I would make that something that happened in the game. If you take the water chip from Necropolis, when you come back, there's a bunch of angry ghouls. You go back later, there's far fewer ghouls, and like, the water's running out, some of us are leaving, but we're being hunted down, and we hate you. But at any point, you could then fix their, they had their own water purification, I think they had a well or something, you could fix that. So that means dialogues would change. It's extra work, but I would love to put that in, to the game, make Fallout even, take it to the next level of kind of reactivity.

Along that line, I would fix the end slides. I'd make better end slides, I'd make more end slides, and I would fix the existing end slides that didn't trigger because of bugs. So I think it's important when you finish the game to be told, here's all the long-term ramifications, more than just changes on the individual map, you know, that's where we talked about how Shady Sands turned into NCR. I went those kind of long-term reactions told in insides for almost all the places in the game, even like the Glow, you could just say the Glow remained radioactive, but you know, it was eventually fenced off, and warning signs were put up. Something to just say, hey, people recognize every location in the game.

Then I'd make what I call my massive mechanics pass, and I'll break that down. First of all, I'd go through SPECIAL. I don't think there's a huge number of changes I've made here, but I do think things like Charisma should do more. I, we in the sequel in Fallout 2, we made Charisma control how many people you could put in your party, how many companions you could get. I wanted to do other things as well, how people react to you, more Charisma checks in dialogues and in some RPG elements in the game.

I would also rework Intelligence. Like, Intelligence

 and Agility were so good in Fallout that everybody was like, you've got to get them. But I loved low intelligence characters, so I probably change not tie skill points to intelligence, do something else with that. They did that in Fallout New Vegas, so I like things like that. Then I make a skill pass, and again, I think some of these were already done in the first-person Fallout, but things like we don't need doctor and first aid, gambling should have been either more useful or rolled into something else, like maybe it's a perk that you buy to extend speech.

I think if keep in mind though increasing the level cap is going to make changes to skills because if you can go to a higher level, you're going to get a lot more skill points, and you're eventually going to move a lot of the skills up to max. Similarly with the traits, you're going to get a lot more, oh wait no, with perks, you're going to get a lot more perks if we up the level cap, so I would basically make a huge pass through perks and look at things like Friendly Foe, which was a perk in Fallout and then just got rolled into the everybody's got it, it's part of the interface in Fallout 2. I would do things like that.

A lot of the world map perks had very either minimal effect, you know, things like the Outdoorsman and the Pathfinder and Scout, or made things less interesting. I mean, Scout made it less likely you'd ever have a random encounter, and some of those random encounters were good, and people remember the random encounters. I wouldn't want to put a perk in that said, hey, you know, the cool stuff in the game, you're going to get less of it, so I'd make a pass through perks. There are also perks that in the old game because of the level cap, you were very unlikely to get, like Sniper or Slayer, because they didn't get into level 18, and there was a level 20 cap, and you were unlikely to hit level 20 because you'd run out of things to do. So, you know, that's why making changes to maps and adding creature respawning, I think, would address that and up being level cap.

And finally, I'd make a pass on traits. The traits were wildly different. I think gifted was way too strong. Instead of saying all your stats go up by one, I'd maybe make you pick, you could pick two or three, and you were gifted in those areas. Some other trades, I just wanted to go through all the traits and make sure that there was some semblance. I don't care about pure balance, but when things are so imbalanced, people are like, well, you have to take this, kind of like harm in Arcanum. That was out of bounds, that was wacky, and that was wrong. I don't want to make a magic system where it's like, here's the one spell that's the best one to take, and all the others pale. Similarly, with the traits, I don't want to make it a trait system where you're like, well, you have to take gifted. Okay, now that you're taking gifted, what kind of character you're making? Look at the traits. I want all the traits to be what kind of character am I making, would this be good for them, would this be bad for them, would I rather have this? And I like things like that.

That is an awful lot to change. I think it's enough to change. Of course, rolled into all this would be fixing all the bugs, like when you played chess with the computer's ax in the glow, something was supposed to happen if you got a critical success, but there was a bug in the game, and you could not get critical successes against attribute roles. Trivia with a fix, by the way, absolutely trivial, a one-line change, but that was it didn't exist, so you never got the critical success playing chess against ax. Fix things like that, just so people could see that there was a lot of content that either got cut or never could trigger because of bugs. I'd want to fix all those things.

I think that's enough. So, I think a much higher resolution game with better AI and better UI and the new features that I mentioned, with the respawning and the reactivity and the map changes and end slides, and then a pass through the whole mechanics. I think that's enough. I don't want to change Fallout too drastically in a remake, but I think this could be done, and it would open up the game to being a lot more user-friendly to modern gamers.

So that's how I'd make a Fallout remake, Evan Chandler.

Top Five Modern RPG Masterclass.md

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim, and today I want to talk about my top five modern RPG masterclass. Before I start, new camera setup—it's mounted, it's a little higher, it's a little farther back. Let's see how this goes. I'm playing around with things.

So, what do I mean by the top five modern RPG Master Class? Well, I did a video about a month ago of my top five video games, and these are the games that I grew up with and the ones that I thought were the most influential in how I made games in my career. That's not what these five RPGs are. These are going to be five role-playing games that I think are the best to learn from as certain aspects of them for game development, and specifically for RPG development.

Do I think these are the best games ever? Maybe not, maybe I do. That's not the point of this list. This list is, you want to learn how to make RPGs, there are five games on this list that you should pay attention to, whether you even like them or not. They do what they do better than anyone else. I'm also want to mention that if I mention a game but I don't mention its prequel of it or Forerunner or something, it's because I think the one I'm talking about is better to learn the thing I'm I think it teaches.

Also, I'm going to afterward, after I do the five, I'm going to talk about three runners-up and I'll tell you why they didn't make it into the top five. So, let's start. This is probably going to surprise you. I'm going to start with *World of Warcraft*, an MMORPG. World of Warcraft was amazing because, in my opinion, even though it wasn't the first MMO and maybe not even the best MMO, it did prove that if you make the games easier, they'll be more fun. I played EverQuest before any other MMORPG, and I love EverQuest, but EverQuest was hard. Compared to EverQuest, I still remember somebody who worked on it said, yeah, in the whole carrot-stick model, we decided less stick and more carrot. To be honest, WoW is pretty much all carrot. It is an easy game. It is an easy, easy, easy game. I said that once to a coworker who was a huge WoW player, and he was offended a bit. He said, "I play in raids and blah," and I'm like, eh, it's all, you know, timing and motion; you might as well be playing Dance Dance Revolution. But it's fun, and I don't want to make it sound like I'm belittling WoW because it is a fun-forward game. And if you remember my design pillars, one of them was fun trumps realism. In fact, I think fun trumps just about everything. And you can tell when they made World of Warcraft, they were like, this is fun forward. It is the most important thing about WoW is that it's fun, which is why when I tell you what my number two RPG if you're to learn from is, it's going to be a bit of a surprise because it's *Elden Ring*. Elden Ring is hard. It proves the adage that harder is more fun, which is the exact opposite of what I just said about World of Warcraft. And that's because games can have a design pillar, and if they execute well on that pillar, they're a perfect example of that pillar in action. Elden Ring is a perfect example of an RPG where harder makes it more fun. Now, I know a lot of people go, "Why don't you talk about Dark Souls, um, Demon Souls?" And it's because, for me, getting into the open world of Elden Ring, where I could come back and do a boss later, there were, there were, there was a lot of non-bosses. It was a beautiful open world. The story and lore were there for you as much as you wanted. You kind of needed to dig for it sometimes. It wasn't always just presented to you front and center. I loved that. Some other things that, when I played it, made me go, ooh, I do like how this works, is their use of status gauges. And by that, I mean in a lot of my RPGs, you would gain poison, you would gain radiation, and it would just start affecting you immediately. I like how Elden Ring, when you were attacking something that caused poison, it would add up in its own poison gauge, and if that gauge filled up, then bam, you got a status effect, and you're poisoned. So, you could see that status; you could see that gauge filling, and there were things you could do to stop it before you actually got poisoned. I like that because there's a lot of things you can do with that in terms of a role-playing game mechanic. You can make the gauge fills fill um less quickly, you can make the gauge bigger, you can have things that drain stuff out of the gauge. I like that, and this is all before you even get the status effect that that gauge is controlling. So, Elden Ring showed me a lot of things that I didn't used to do, or I didn't do in my games, but I thought were really, really good lessons in how to make a beautiful open world lore-filled game with cool mechanics.

My third RPG, *Skyrim*. Skyrim is an absolute masterclass in Exploration. There's a reason people are still playing this game, what, 12 years later, almost 13 now. There's a reason it's been ported to everything under the planet. It's a Wonderful game, and I particularly am calling out the art, especially the variety in art, and the level design. There are lots of places that you can go explore in Skyrim that are gorgeous, gorgeous unto themselves, like here's a cave, here's an icy cave, here's a cave with a lot of water in it, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful. Here's an underground city, here's an above-ground City, here's a village, here's a village in a forest, here's a village perched on the side of a mountain crag. Wonderful. I loved Skyrim. I loved exploring Skyrim. I love the feel it had. I've told many people that Skyrim is the closest that I've ever come to playing, playing D&D on a computer, the way it seems like it in my head when I'm playing the tabletop version. So, Skyrim definitely is up there in my top five.

My fourth one, *Fallout New Vegas*. Fallout New Vegas, I think, is the masterclass in taking an older game and bringing it into a new era. The three things that I think Fallout New Vegas did exceptionally well: it extended the storylines, and with those, the characters, and factions of the first two games into a modern 3D era in its own location. So, we got to see the NCR, and we got to see the Brotherhood of Steel, all brought up to date and moved into a nearby adjoining area, from California into Nevada, and seeing how they would interact. I thought Fallout in Vegas got the humor really well. There were parts of that game that were hilarious,

 both in dialogues and environmental storytelling, and just some of the situations you find yourself in. And that's hard to do; it's really hard to do. So, Props to them. And then, finally, I love the reactivity in Fallout New Vegas. You had to make choices in Fallout New Vegas, and they weren't presented to you in black and white, and those choices had significant uh consequences. So, they weren't fake choices; it wasn't like, do you want to do A or B, and A or B turned out to be kind of the same thing. They are fundamentally different, whether, how if you join House versus um, Kaizar's Legion, versus um, yes man, those are all wildly different things that happen. I think one of the things that, that I really loved when I played Fallout New Vegas is when I finished it, I immediately wanted to play it again, which is a sign of a really good game. Now, props of Fallout 3 for bringing Fallout from 2D into 3D, um, I could call out a lot of things, but especially like turning the VATS mechanics into Vats, wonderful. But I think Fallout New Vegas went the next step with a lot of those things, and I think the tone is perfect. So, Fallout New Vegas is what I point to when people are like, hey, how would you take a game from the '80s or '90s and turn it into a modern game? Fallout New Vegas.

And then finally, the master class number five of my top five, *Baldur's Gate 3*. Finally got to play it, let me just say that I'm super happy that turn-based is back and in vogue. I never went out of style with me. Also, pure D&D is now considered fun again; it's not too hard, it's not niche. I love that. I particularly love character customization in Baldur's Gate; you can make wildly different characters that behave wildly different in the game. And again, there's a lot of choices, player choices, and a lot of reactivity to those choices. The thing that got me with Baldur's Gate 3 the most, though, is I love it when industry know-it-alls, and I'm talking developers, critics, fans, get proved wrong when they say things like RPGs are dead, or turn-based is boring, or D&D is dead, or it's niche, or whatever, and then I love Baldur's Gate 3 comes along and just goes, nope, you're wrong, you are wrong. And I can already hear the queuing up the exception of to that saying, uh, no, it, Baldur's Gate 3 is the exception that proves the rule. No, it's the rule. The problem is nothing is really gone. Adventure games aren't gone, PC gaming isn't dead. These things are as good as what the games are that are made for them. And Baldur's Gate 3 proves that turn-based D&D computer games can be great.

Now, I mentioned I had three runners-up. Oh, I'm talking a long time. I had three runners-up. I will tell you quickly what they are, what they are, what they teach well, and why I didn't include them. One is *Vampire: Bloodlines*. Didn't include it because I worked on it, so I thought that was unfair, but I think it has got great atmospheric storytelling, and characters, and dialogue, and I had nothing to do with any of that, and it is vanan freaking tastic, and it's an RPG, so there's a lot to learn from Vampire: Bloodlines.

The second runner-up was *Half-Life 2*. It's not an RPG; it's a shooter, but wow, it's a shooter with everything else. It's got story, it's got characters, it's got puzzles, it had vehicles you can actually drive around, and gameplay based on physics, and it's just, it is a super, super fun game. And sometimes I look back at and go, did that really come out like 20 years ago? It did, but basically, but still, all these games are um, 21st century. So, and then the last one, oh, before Half-Life 2, Half-Life: Alyx, played it in VR, great. So, proof that whatever they're doing in Half-Life one and two moves forward into modern VR gaming.

And then the last one I just wanted to mention was *Vampire Survivors*. Wow, there are two vampires in my Runners-up. Again, it's not an RPG, and also, it's indie, which isn't my area of expertise. I just wanted to show, give it as an example when people go, oh, I can't possibly make games this big and this involved and all that. Is Vampire Survivors was made by a very small group that were indie and not hugely funded. It does so much with so little. I was like addicted to this game for probably like about a month, um, during the holiday season of 2022. I just played this game all the time. It was super fun. I loved it. It is basically, Bally teaches you, hey, you know, Unity, you can get some simple pixel art, put together, you can make a great game. No excuse, Vampire Survivor shows how to do it, but it's not an RPG, so it didn't make it in my top five RPG master class, but it should be in some master class for someone. That's the teach you how to just make a good game in unity without a lot of budget.

Anyway, that's my top five RPG that you could learn a lot from. I recommend you study them if you haven't played them, play them, even if you don't like them, there's a lot to learn from these games. They're great.

Tropes.md

https://youtu.be/BBaZHtlcHAU?si=tzp2JMDDVoJ-oEab

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim. Today I want to talk about tropes, specifically tropes in computer role-playing games, including the ones I've used and the ones I haven't used because I hate them. Let's start with the first one: amnesia. I hate hate this Trope so hard. And yes, I will say here what I told Chris Avalon about Planescape Torment: you get to use Amnesia once. I view Amnesia as kind of a hacky, lazy way of doing the start of an RPG, and I get why people do it. They want to make a character who doesn't know things the same way the player doesn't know things. I think there's other ways to do it. I've done that in my own games. When you were in Fallout, you left the Vault and you didn't know what was in the world. When you played Arcanum, you were taking a blimp ride to a new continent, so you didn't know what was going on there. So, there's ways around it, but I mean, don't get me wrong, I loved Planescape Torment, so I will just say what I said to Avalon: use it once. Use it once, but if you use it again, I will call you out as a lazy, hacky narrative designer. I think in some ways almost everybody wants to get it out of their system, and once they do, that's it. No more Amnesia, no more amnesiac characters.

Fallout 2's original design by the original team that was doing it had the player waking up after being attacked by Bandits and beaten over the head and having all their gear stolen, and they had Amnesia. So, this was a reason to reset the player to level one with no skills or perks or items. I did not like that, neither did anyone else outside that team. It is part of the reason Fallout 2 got reassigned to me. That's how much people don't like amnesia. So, game developers, stop using amnesia.

Ah, okay, let's talk about some other tropes. I think I've used both of these. Let's talk about the chosen one. A lot of RPGs like starting the player as, you know, he's the savior. He is going to be able to beat defeat the bad guy, or she's uh, was mentioned in Prophecy, and she's going to become the main figure of our religion, of our culture, or whatever. This is okay, but I like subverting it. In every game I did, so in Fallout, the chosen one was sort of subverted. We said you everybody drew straws, and you drew the short one. Part of the reason I wanted to introduce this is we had dumb dialogue, and I couldn't think of any reason why The Vault would have selected an idiot to go out. Well, once you go out, you find out you're not the first person to go out because there's someone dead wearing a uh, a vault jumpsuit right there at the door. So, you find out you were not the first person to send out, and if you're the dumb guy, you're probably not the last one they were planning to send out. They're gonna wait a few weeks, assume you were dead, send someone else out. We did the same thing in Arcanum, but this time we ramped it up. That's why Virgil comes running up to you at the crash site. "It's what the prophecy said," he says. "You're super important, you're the chosen one, you're," he's been expecting you. You, and what I love is, I love when you're playing a dumb dialogue character, you can tell people later, "Hey, Virgil said I was impotent." So yeah, it's okay to use a Trope, especially if you play with it.

There's another Trope about being unrealistic. Did this all the time. Fallout had radiation making Newton people and mutant scorpions and Newton everything. We had bloody mess as a perk that somehow, you take this perk, and people explode when you shoot them. Yeah, I, I don't mind unrealistic stuff. I, you could call it taking artistic license. I don't care as long as the game is fun because of it, and once you do it, you have to be consistent. So, I think that having the first few monsters say, "oh, radiation did this," and then later on, you have a bunch of normal animals living around radiation. Yeah, so just once you decide on it, just run with it, have fun, be consistent.

I know one Trope that people consider is trophy is, uh, a gray morality in video games. Let me just say that 25 years ago, this was not a Trope. No one was doing this. So, we started it before it was a thing. I don't mean to be all hipster and say, "oh, it's cool before it was. I did that before it was cool," but we did do great morality when everyone else was making the player forced to be the hero of the story. We liked that you could be a bad guy, and people would call you out for it. So, I like that trope.

There's another Trope I hear people talk about, ironically, talking a boss to death. Now, we allowed that in a lot of our games, and by we, I mean me and the team because we talked about this at the very beginning because it's always one of my design pillars that there are multiple ways to solve the main story quests. In Fallout, there were three ways, and one of them was dialogue, which meant there had to be a way to talk your way through things like getting the water chip, killing the mutants at the military base, and killing the master. And we tried to give them prerequisites, like you couldn't just run straight to the master and say, "you should kill yourself." You at least had to have talked to re at the brother of Steel, and she sends you to do some gather some data for her, and then she tells you that she's discovered the mutants are sterile. You can, she gives you a disc for your Pip Boy that has that information on it. Only then, if you have that at a real high speech skill, can you talk your way in the master of proving that his plan is going to work, and then he just kills himself. So, I like to think that we did that Trope Justice. I don't ever think you should just be able to walk up to somebody and go, "I got a 20 speech, kill yourself." That's dumb.

Another Trope is the Trope of the heroic monster, and we did that sometimes. Harold, ghouls were supposed to be monsters and bad guys, and not necessarily Heroes. I mean, the ones in the Acropolis aren't necessarily bad, but Harold was, you know, a heroic guy in our first one. He meant well, he tried to help people. In Arcanum, we had gar, the world's smartest orc. Um, and yes, he's human, but you only find that out if you dig for it. But what I liked about that was, even though it's a Trope to have a heroic monster,

 it's kind of subverting the Trope that certain kinds of characters, Orcs, ghouls, super mutants, are always bad guys. So, part of our gray game design was we wanted these characters to be, some of them are heroes, the same way that some of the elves are bad. Just, we wanted to play with that.

And then the final thing I wanted to talk about is Romance. This one's kind of like Amnesia, although I don't have that rule if you get one use. I don't like romance options in RPGs. I never got into them, although that didn't stop me putting in other features that I'm not that into but I feel people want to do. But I think a lot of games don't do them well, and I agree with Leonard because Leonard and I discussed this at length before we started out of Worlds. It takes a lot of work, a lot of narrative work, and some Quest design and level design work to make romance options really a good choice in an RPG. You can't just glue them on. If you want to guarantee that people will hate your romance options, just try gluing them in, and it's terrible. So, I think if you're going to have them, they have to be really good, and the characters have to be written to support them. And at that point, now you're talking about all the different ways you can do romance options. Can the player only romance someone of the opposite gender? Can there be same-gender ones? Can the same player Romance, uh, people of multiple genders? Can that player romance more than one person? These are all decisions you have to make, and once you make that decision one way, I guarantee you there are people are like, "well, I don't really want that." You know, like, okay, the people who don't want same-sex romance options, their view it as, "well, now you took all these potential Companions, and I can't woo them because I'm the wrong gender." So, then you end up with games that let everybody woo everyone all the time, and then it stops feeling like romance is even a thing. It just feels kind of like a bad dating simulator. So, these are things that I never got into, and I just didn't really want them in my game, so we just took them out of Outer Worlds and put it in by letting Pavardi have a romance with another NPC, and you can facilitate, but you don't have to.

So, let's see, so the tropes basically I talked about were Amnesia, I hate; Chosen One; unrealistic mechanics; gray morality; talking bosses to death; and the Rogue monster. I've used all those, and I like them. Romance options, eh, I don't personally like it. I don't put it in my game because I think it takes too much, uh, resources to do right. If you like them and you want to put them in your game, knock yourself out. Just do a good job with it. It's very easy to screw that up.

Okay, I think that's everything I have to say about tropes.
Title:
Using Geometry To Constrain Dice Rolls.md
Youtube Link:
https://youtu.be/RfNtPr7LeGQ?si=-YqtzYjA2PaHkAIN

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim, and today I want to talk about using geometry to constrain dice rolls. First, before I get into that, because there's a history and there's a video, and let's do a thought experiment. Let's say you're making a new tabletop role-playing game, and you just want to use six-sided dice, and let's say there's a skill that requires you to roll two six-sided dice for that skill, you know, generating two to 12. But you want it to be more interesting than that. You want something special to happen if you roll a one, and you want something good to happen if you roll a six, and then you want something special to happen if you roll a one and a six.

So, looking at that, you're like, wait a minute, I don't want double bads if I roll two ones, and I don't want double goods if I roll two sixes, and the specials don't happen very frequently. A one and a six don't happen as often as I like. They're happening about as often as the goods and the bads, and you kind of want specials to be a little more often. Sorry, there's a dog playing back there.

So, what do you do? Now, you could do what I see a lot of tabletop and computer games do, which is you make a lot of new rules. You could treat double ones and double sixes as a one and a six, so that's something the player has to know, or you'll see a roll happen in a video game, and then one of the numbers will change. You're like, why did that happen? Or you could say if you roll a double one or double six, you have to roll one of those dice, or maybe you have to roll both of them. And so again, it's a rule that the player just has to know for your tabletop game, or they see it happening in the computer game. They see a double ones roll, and then they pop up, and they roll again, and they're like, why did that happen?

So, just bear with me. You could fix this if the dice were just a little special. What if on one of the dice, the one that had the one, you replace the six on the other side with another one, and on the die that had the six, you replace the one on the other side with another six. So now, you have a die that goes 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and another die that goes 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6. Guess what? With those dice, you are never going to roll two ones, and you're never going to roll two sixes, and one and six are a little more common than they were on the other dice. You just solved it. No rules for the player to remember, no rolls. We basically used geometry to get exactly what we wanted without introducing any extra stuff. You, the player, just rolls. That's what I like, and that's the basis of the idea I'm going to tell you next.

So, I spoke at reboot conference in Croatia in Debrnik in 2017, and I explained something I called my triangle attribute idea. I'm going to throw the video, a link to the video up. It is at 10 minutes 25 seconds in. I'll make the link jump straight to it. If you want to watch the whole thing, great, but where I really start talking about it is 10 minutes and 25 seconds.

In what I wanted to do, and what gave me this idea, was I wanted to make a game that was like SPECIAL in Fallout, that had rules like SPECIAL, but I didn't want to introduce a bunch of new rules. Also, I wanted to drop luck. I've said this in other places, if I was going to do luck today, I would do it as a perk with multiple levels you could buy rather than an attribute that somehow is part of your physical makeup.

So, what that does is, if you drop luck, you immediately see that you're left with three physical and three mental attributes. You have strength, agility, and endurance, and on mental, you had charisma, intelligence, and perception. So, I'm like, okay, what if we took those and put them on a triangle, so each one gets its own triangle. So, the strength, or the physical triangle, has in its corners S, A, and E, and the mental triangle has in its corners P, I, and C.

Now, now that they're in triangles, you can use how the triangles are shaped to determine how good those attributes are. If the triangle is up, then that means the top one is really good, and the two down here are okay. If it points down, the two up at the top that are at the flat part on the top are good, and the one at the bottom is bad. So, now you have a way for the player to spin these triangles that give you options for both of the physical and mental attributes independently, and there are no rules they have to remember. There's no rules like, oh, you're not allowed to have two really bad attributes, or like in D&D, the original AD&D, hey, if you rolled two attributes that were five or less, that's an unviable character. You have to throw them away. You just have to know that role. In fact, I'm not even sure it lists that role. Anyway, where it comes up is you notice on the attribute charts, it says, oh, you have a five or less, you have to be this class, and then if you roll two fives or lower, you're like, how do I be both of these classes? And somebody said, well, you're gonna have to multiclass. It's like, well, there is no multiclass for assassin/magic user, you know.

Just, what I like about this, oh, and by the way, you could even decide with those two triangles that one of them is the main triangle and the other one's secondary. So, you could say, I'm primarily physical, mentals are my secondary, or I'm primary mental, and physicals are my secondary, and then you give little elevated, a little bonus. So, like the one that's above, it's, you add a little bonus to each one of those three attributes, whether it's pointing up or down. You just give little bonuses to those because your main group is mental. Those are things you could change, and again, that just has to do with positioning and all that. And you could say, hey, this is how it works.

Now, you may be going, why are you doing this? Why is this something that interesting to you? And here's why. I find that dice rolls with rules, and even point buys with a lot of rules, a lot of times those rules are completely nonsensical to the player, and there's often a lot of them, and sometimes they're unwritten, like I said, that rule in AD&D about what happens if you roll a character with two fives or lower, you just have to know that's not a viable character, and you have to throw it away.

 Sometimes those rules are unwritten, or they're a secondary effect of these other rules that say you have to be this class, and you can be no other class.

But sometimes, if you're doing a skill point system, you notice it doesn't let you drop more than one attribute below eight or five, or it doesn't ever let you drop them that low. The only way to get them lower is if you take some kind of disadvantage or trait that makes those lower, which makes you question, what happens if two stats are really low, or three? What happens if all six are low? Is that player even viable? And that's something the designer has to worry about, so they often put these constraints in, so they either don't have to worry about it or because they've discovered that those characters aren't viable. And to me, that feels like the hand of the designer reaching in and going, boom, that character conception you have, even though it's valid with the rules I gave you for point buy or for rolling dice, I'm going to add extra rules so you can't have that character. And that's a little too strong for me. I like when I feel the hand of designer saying, hey, I like you sneaking inventory out of the shopkeeper's back pocket, or I like you doing stealth attacks from range in this game. That I like. What I don't like is when the designer is basically saying, no, don't do that. Why? Because I said so. And sometimes you figure out it's like, oh, they didn't balance their game for all the different character builds, or their rules left some things, some character builds in limbo, so they made new rules to get rid of those characters. I don't like that.

What I liked about my triangle idea was it let the player make any shapes they want. You can spin any of those you want, and anything you make is valid, guaranteed. It's valid. There's nothing to remember. There's nothing to go, oh, I'm not allowed to do that, or there's nothing. You can spin something, and it turns red and goes, you can't do that. You just spin these numbers anywhere, spin these triangles anywhere you want, look at what it's saying. You know, oh, my strength is really high. Oh, now it's just okay. Oh, now it's bad. That's just how you make a character. The geometry is the constraint, not points and rules. And players see geometry, and they can see how their stuff is working. And I know people are like, oh, you're just dumbing things down. And I'm like, no, I'm moving it to a different set of constraints. There are ways of presenting things to players that don't require them to remember a bunch of additional roles that seemingly have nothing to do with the, oh, you can add, you can increase an attribute at a certain cost, and you can decrease it to get points back. Oh, but here's a bunch of extra rules you have to obey.

So, I tried to get this working on Outer Worlds. We actually got it working. We got it in and functional, but it didn't quite hit what we wanted. Some people who played the game felt like there were characters they couldn't make. Other people got confused at exactly what they were doing with it. Let me just say this. I think there's a good idea in there somewhere. The same way that I wanted flaws for decades in a game, and I couldn't figure out how to do it unless I did it the GURPS way, where you have to buy them all at the beginning, or the way we didn't fall out and Arcanum, where we added flaws in with bonuses, and we called them traits or backgrounds. I wanted a pure flaw. Took me a while to figure out how to do that. I did it in Outer Worlds. It's up to you whether you think it was successful, but I got it in a game. I think this, using geometry to constrain roles, whether it's for attributes or skills or whatever in a game, is a good idea. What I'm hoping is that there's someone out there smarter than me who will figure out a way to do this, 'cause I couldn't figure out a way of getting this in a game that made people happy. But I think there's a good idea in that space somewhere. So again, it's basically using geometry, shapes, whatever you want to call it, to constrain what the player can do, rather than throw a bunch of a random amount of points and some extra additional rules that seem nonsensical or just over-constraining. Rather than do that, I like the idea of using the geometry. I just couldn't pull it off. Maybe one of you can figure it out. So, let me know if you do.

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim, and today I want to talk about UX design. Specifically, I want to answer a question from Anubis 1101 or Anubis 13 (I see what you did there) who asks, "Is UX design taken seriously in your opinion, or is it more of an afterthought? Are there any specific experiences related to it that you can share that you haven't already?"

It's a good question, and this does go into a big chunk of my history in video games because over the last 40 some years, massive changes have happened in what you would call UX. UX is a relatively recent term too. Before that, it was called UI; before that, it wasn't called anything.

So, let me talk about how this evolved. When I first started in the game industry in the 80s, there was no UI, there was no UX. It was just, you made a game and part of making a game was there was an input layer and interfaces, and you made those. These were made just like anything else in the game was made. Back then, everybody was a generalist, so anybody might have done these. It might have been several different programmers on the team did it; often, you're the only programmer on the team, so you did it. It didn't mean that you were a user interface programmer; you were just a programmer, and the interface was part of the game.

Then it kind of changed into UI in the 90s. It was considered to be the interfaces, nothing else. And I'll talk in a minute about what I think UX people refer to in the minux. It was specifically these are the screens that the player uses when they interact with the game, whether it's a hot bar at the bottom, whether it's an inventory screen that pops up. That was UI. There were still no specific UI people. When I did Rags to Riches, the UI was made by the producer, and he wrote them. And I wish I could find it, he would draw them for me on napkins at lunch or write them on, uh, he had these pads of paper on his desk that Realtors would leave. If you lived in Irvine, Realtors would always throw paper on your pads of paper on your front porch so that if you owned the house and if you ever wanted to sell it, there was the name and picture of a realtor, and the pictures are always like these anyway. He would... I had tons of these, and I swear I had them, and I looked for them, and I cannot find it. But that's how interface was kind of treated. It was kind of like, "Oh yeah, we guess we do have you getting phone calls in the game from people. I guess you're going to have to make an interface here. Let's have a portrait, and here's what the text goes, and then there's a done button when they're done reading. Where should it appear on the screen? Just put it in the center." There was no real thought to, "Hey, what is this going to feel like when the player does it?" It's more of a functional approach.

A lot of the interfaces were done with whoever was responsible. So like if there was an inventory interface, the programmer who is going to program it may sit down with the design who designed it, and they talk about it for a while. At some point, they grab an artist and go, "Hey, this is what we're thinking about doing. What's this going to amount to?" If they were really good, they would get a producer too and go, "Hey, we just planned this, and we think it's going to take two months, and here's why." You know, now all the stuff is, they get the estimates upfront, but back then, it was like kind of go as you do it as you go.

About late 20 000s, I want to say around 2007 or 8, that's when I really started hearing people use the term UX, and when we started making a dedicated UX team. When I started doing, become when I became the design director at Carbine, I wanted a dedicated UX team, and that meant a programmer, an artist, and a designer sitting together in the same room doing just that. And this caused a couple of issues. Keep in mind, right then, I kind of wanted specialists, this in that sense. I contributed to three people specializing in their career, but it was because we really had a lot of interfaces and inputs and screen real estate that needed to be thought of in advance because you had to think, "What's going to happen when the player's soloing? What is it like when he's in a group? Is there enough screen real estate for all of this? What's it like in a raid?"

So that group generated a lot of questions back to the design group, and stuff had to be redone. There was also a bit of pushback because at Carbine, everybody sat with their own kind. Designers sat with designers, programmers sat with programmers, and artists sat in their own walled-off area. This was the one concession I got, was I got a room with a designer, a programmer, and an artist. They originally didn't want to do it. That all changed after they just worked a while together because they found they could iterate really quickly. You know, the designer could just turn and ask the programmer, "Would this be hard to do? I'm thinking about doing this." And the programmer go, "Well, if you just change this one little thing here, it would be way, way easier to code." "Oh, I can do that." Boom. Things got a lot more smoothly because the artist sitting right there, you turned around and go, "Wait, you need an animated icon there? Or you need, uh, is the icon going to be 2D or 3D? Is it going to be a texture on a 3D object, or is it going to be an actual the interface itself is made up of 3D objects?" It was interesting to go in there and watch them talk because it was much more interactive and dynamic than I expected, and it worked great, by the way.

So, UX itself, which we probably should talk about, is more than just interface. It used to be you thought of things as, "Here's the input layer. Inputs come in. Is it a, is it an event like they've typed A, or is it a an event like A is being pressed down, now A is being released?" Because sometimes you need to know, is a key being held, pressed, held, or released? Is it being double-tapped? Um, sometimes you just want to know they type the letter A because you're just doing input on into a text box. The UX team thought about these things and took them into account, but it was more than just that input, and it was more than just interfaces. It was sound effects. It was how long things stayed up. It was the coloring of things, which is very important to me. It was the experience, and that's the X in experience. It was, "Do these elements, do these interface elements make sense? Are they easy to use, and are they easy for the player to recognize and remember

?" And that's a tough thing to do. Just saying, "Does it make sense?" is a difficult thing to measure. It's also very difficult for the team to have insight into this when you've read the design dock, and you know what you're trying to do in an interface. That puts you in a way very different position than somebody who sits down, has never played the game before, and an interface pops up, and they have to figure out what to do. You might think something simple to understand because you made it. You also may think something is really easy to understand or to remember what it means because you've already done it like a hundred times. But you've all had the experience in a game where it tells you something like, "This is how you do a power attack. Double tap this, or hold down the left and right bumpers at the same time, or, you know, sweep them M back and forth, or double click." But then, when you, 10-15 minutes later, when you're actually in the game and you're middle of combat, you kind of forget what you were supposed to do. And that's why a lot of interfaces now either have a tutorial level, or the first few times the button pops up, like when you're ready to do a power attack on somebody, a little button may pop up, and it's like, "Press A to do your power attack." These are things that come up when you realize the interface that you designed isn't always super obvious to the player who's playing, and you want to give them clues. You want to give them, you want to lead them at the beginning of the game, and then you can gradually turn that off.

I had a video on focus groups said I had a love-hate relationship with focus groups. Focus groups for testing UX is one of the things I like because you will sit down with people who, while they're gamers, and you can usually ask, you know, when you try to collect these people, you want people who are experienced gamers. They're experienced gamers; sometimes they even say they're experienced in the genre. People go, "I play RPGs all the time," and you know, that. So then, when you watch how they play, you can go, "Well, we made this interface, and general gamers aren't getting it. The RPG gamers are." And then you have to ask yourself, "Well, am I trying to make a game for everybody, or am I trying to make a game for hardcore RPG players?" And that will inform how you look at the feedback from the focus group. But I do think focus groups are really good for user interface because if there's one thing in your game that's supposed to be easy, should never get in your way, and that's interface. And that's always the thing I tell UX teams. It's a sad truth, but if you design a really good UX for a game, no one will say anything. And yes, I'm generalizing for all the literalists who have been telling me, "You're overgeneralizing." In general, people don't say, "That had a really good interface." If you haven't, make a good interface, no one will mention it. Make a bad interface, it's at the top of every reviewer's list. So, it's kind of the sad part of being a UX designer or programmer or artist, is when you do your job, you're kind of not in their way of experiencing the game, and they experience the game, and they have a fun time, and their comments are about the game. Like, "Oh, I didn't really like combat," or "Crafting didn't generate anything I wanted," and or whatever their comments are, pro and con about the game. But if your interface is good, they probably won't mention it. But when it's bad, they can be like, "H, I go in the crafting interface, and it never highlights the resources I need for the item I want to make." And it's... it, when I'm out in the world collecting things, it doesn't highlight the things that I'm looking for. And there's all kinds of things that they will say if they don't like your interface. But if they love it, silence.

So, it's a very demanding job with very few vocal rewards. You will rarely hear that, "Hey, you did a really good job with this," and you will frequently heard, "This isn't good," or "People don't understand this." It's kind of why I kind of went out of my way, um, on Outer Worlds, stop by the UX people a lot and tell them what I thought about what they were doing, the good stuff and the bad stuff, because I don't think they get that very much. And certainly, when the game ships, they usually don't hear anything because they've done a good job.

So, anyway, that's my thoughts on UX in video games, and I hope this answers your question, Anubis 1101.

Villains.md

https://youtu.be/oyAC8sVWjiM?si=zrkRAinZ-ZYtDtKO

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim, and today I want to talk about villains in my appropriately lit villains lair. So, I've done a video about bosses where I talked about bosses being encounters that tested how well the player was getting at the game using that particular character, but villains are different. Villains are bosses, but all bosses are not villains. Villains are the characters that drive the story, and usually, there at the end, there's an encounter with the villain who is a boss, but the villain is the one who made the whole story proceed. 

So, I wanted to talk about what makes a good villain. I'm going to define them, kind of give some examples from my games, and then I want to talk about a villain that I did badly that I want to redo. 

So, let's talk about what makes a good villain. I think the best thing about a villain is that their goal is not only believable — you think that they're actually going to be able to achieve this goal — but it's also justifiable, in the sense that it kind of makes sense. It's kind of something that you could be convinced is a good thing, maybe the player can even be swayed to join the villain. I think that's important. It's a lot better than just having this mustache-twirling villain that's like, "I'm going to kill everybody," or "I'm evil because evil." I'd much rather have a villain who is trying to do something that he thinks makes the world better. Maybe it's not what you think is better, but it's a better thing from the villain's point of view.

I think what's important for the story too is that the villain is telegraphed, meaning you hear about the villain, you learn things about the villain, you see the effects of what the villain is doing as you play the game. It shouldn't just be a surprise at the end, somebody pops up and goes, "It was me, Mario!" But, I'm not sure if you should actually encounter the villain. Some games have you do that, but then they make the villain invulnerable; he always gets away, and I don't like that. But that means if you do want to encounter the villain early, you have to plan for the fact that the players may kill the villain, and that'll end the game early, and there's nothing wrong with that. You might want to do that. But, I think other ways you could do that is the villain could contact the player, maybe if it's a sci-fi game, they do phone calls or video calls, or maybe in any kind of game, they leave notes. But they can also have intermediaries that show up and talk on the villain's behalf.

So, let me talk about some villains that I thought we did well on the games I made, and just so you know, there are spoilers here. I'm going to spoil Fallout, Arcanum, The Outer Worlds, and Temple of Elemental Evil. So, if you haven't played any of those and you don't want spoilers, don't listen.

So, I think Fallout had a great villain in The Master. You hear about The Master — actually, you don't even hear about The Master, you hear about mutants, and then you finally encounter mutants, and then you learn that the mutants seem to be systematically hunting vaults, and then you run into The Lieutenant, who's very intelligent and not what you thought a master would be — sorry, not what you think a mutant would be. And then he tells you about The Master, and you're like, "Who is this Master?" And he actually implies that The Master has a plan, that he's actually trying to do a good thing. He's trying to unite the wastelands, and when you actually encounter The Master, he tells you that. He's like, "Look, all the mutants are immune to radiation, and they live a long time, and I can control them, so I'm going to unite humanity as mutants." Now, what I loved about this is yes, you can fight him, and yes, you can blow him up, but you can also convince him he's wrong by pointing out that mutants are sterile. So, I love that about The Master. He's a real person, even though he's two people in a computer glued together, and his plan makes sense, at least as far as he's concerned.

Let's move on to Arcanum. I like Arcanum's villain because you play the whole game, and you're not really sure what's going on, and someone seems to be trying to wipe out people and tech, and then you find out there's something about the dwarves and the void, and you find out it's Arronax. And now you have to stop Arronax, and you finally get to the void, and it's not Arronax, it's some other guy, Kerghan, who's even more evil, who was masquerading as Arronax. And he has a reason; he points out that life is suffering, so he wants to end life. And he has a really long soliloquy, and it's kind of convincing; it kind of makes you go, "Wow, that kind of makes sense, wiping out everybody on the planet." Now, I think he's crazy, but I just like the fact that he has a plan, he can enact the plan, and he thinks it's for the best. So, I like that.

Now, let's talk about The Outer Worlds. I liked the villain in The Outer Worlds — spoiler alert — you have to pick one, either it's Phineas or it's The Board. And you can be on Phineas's side and go against The Board, or you can be on The Board's side and turn in Phineas. I think it's interesting that so many people who played The Outer Worlds and talk about The Outer Worlds think that The Board was the evil group, and I'm really surprised at that because, let me frame this for you. If you think this, let me tell you something. Let's take a look at Phineas. Phineas forces you into doing what he wants; he doesn't even ask you. In fact, as soon as you can ask a question, he just ejects you right down to the planet and pretty much tells you, you better do what he says, or you're going to have explosive cell death or whatever. Now, keep in mind his plan because food grown on the colony of Halcyon isn't nutritious; it's over the generations, it's lost its nutrition. His plan is to defrost all the engineers and scientists on The Hope and get them working on this problem. Now, look at it this way. His plan requires a lot more people to be eating whatever food is left, and he's hoping they solve it. And if they do, great; if they don't, the end of Halcyon comes even faster, and the end is catastrophic. There are too many mouths to feed already, and he's putting more mouths out there. Now, let's look at what The Board's planning to do. They're saying, "Why don't we freeze part of the population? We'll keep working on the problem, but that'll give us a long time to solve it, and nobody has to

 die. Everybody gets to live their life, even though it's time-shifted." Let's look at their plan. If they succeed, great, they can defrost everybody, and everything can go back to how it was. But if they fail, nobody dies; people just have to continue to live their lives in this time-shifted way where part of the population always spends its time in cryo-storage. Well, that doesn't sound so bad. At least it doesn't have the catastrophic failure that Phineas has. So, I would argue that The Board isn't the evil path, but what I love about The Outer Worlds is it lets you pick. You can decide which one you think is good and which one is evil, and then fight the other one. So, that's good, and the whole thing gets telegraphed to you. You know what's going on by the time, by the end, when you have to pick.

Now, let's talk about a game I made that I don't think went well, and this is one that I was involved in the writing, and that's Temple of Elemental Evil. I've always said I thought it should have a better story, but one thing I really thought needed to be better about it was its villain, Zuggtmoy, the queen of fungi, who's at the bottom of the temple. First of all, Zuggtmoy isn't really telegraphed at all. You don't hear anything about her the way we wrote it. What I would do now is, if I was redoing that game, is you would hear about her. You would learn that there's some big evil in the temple. It starts the temple starts with that movie showing The Circle of Eight locking some old crone away. You could learn about them; maybe you can go talk to The Circle of Eight, maybe you can dig into their records. But then you learn what's going on. So, by the time you find the four elemental temples — the earth, air, fire, and water — you can talk to them, maybe you can join one, maybe you can join all of them. Maybe if your character's a really good charisma-based character with all the dialogue skills, maybe you can unite them, and then you can use them in the big fight against Zuggtmoy. But even if that's not what you do, or maybe it is, when you're fighting Zuggtmoy, when she surrenders, that option makes a lot more sense if you're already leading the temples. And then she goes, "Look, you're obviously the worst of the evils. I'll surrender to you." Also, if she's fighting you and she asks you to join her, that makes more sense because now you know everything about her. She's like, "Look, I'm just trying to... And this is it; maybe she isn't just trying to be evil and take over a chunk of Greyhawk. Maybe she's saying, "Look, Lolth is far worse than me. I'm establishing a foothold here so I can prevent Lolth from doing even worse things. Yeah, I'll control this part of Greyhawk, but I'll keep Lolth out." Maybe she's the lesser of two evils. That just makes the story a lot more interesting to me. Right there, that story is just much, much more interesting. I wish I had done that; hindsight's 2020, but that's what I think you need to do if you want to make a good villain.

So, let me recap. Bosses are good for encounter fights, but villains are what drive the story. The villains are bosses, but not all your bosses are going to be villains. Your villains, to be good, should be telegraphed, should have a plan that makes sense, and may even be something the player could be made to agree with. And along the way, when you're playing in the game, you should learn more and more about the villain, either by meeting people who work for the villain, getting notes, and talking to the villain, and seeing the effects of the villain plan roll out. I wish I had done that in Temple, and I think it would have made that game a lot better. I think if you follow some of these rules, you can make a much better story for your RPG and have a really good compelling villain. So, I hope this helps.

Hi everyone, it's me Tim. Can we talk about VR? Okay, that's a lot better. Yeah, let's talk about VR. I have been doing VR, not development but just keeping an eye on it, buying different pieces of hardware, trying it out for probably at least the last five years if not more. I've had this particular helmet, it's the Oculus Meta Quest 2. I don't remember what its name is, and I'll get into that in a second. I've had it for over a year.

**Pros**

I use it at least every week, and for the first several months, I used it every day, and I'll talk about what I do with it. But when I first got it, I tried everything. I played games, I downloaded different apps for doing things like social stuff, and looking at 360 videos, and doing virtual tours of places, and all kinds of things. I'll tell you what I ended up using it for at the very end, but right now, let me just talk about kind of... I'll start with what I think of VR. I'll talk about the pros and the cons, and then I'll tell you what I actually use this thing for now after having it for, you know, a year.

Personally, I kind of hope everything goes AR, that's augmented reality. I already wear glasses, which I use for everything but close-up stuff. I wish I could just put on a pair of glasses and have it do arrows when I'm driving, saying turn here, this is where you have to go, this is this person's name, don't forget to ask them about their kid. I wish I had something like that.

VR is where it is right now seems very primitive. It feels like I'm back with my Atari VCS, and not for graphics reasons, but just because there's just so many things that aren't figured out yet, aren't really working well. They're getting better, literally every VR helmet I've had has been way better than the last one.

So, the pros I think of VR, first of all, that 360 view is amazing. The thing I use it mostly for, I love watching 360 videos, especially space ones like let's explore the Andromeda galaxy or let's take a tour of the solar system, or when I can go to places I probably wouldn't go, like let's walk along the Great Barrier Reef underwater. That's great. I'm not gonna do that in real life. This is awesome.

I also love places I can visit virtually, some of the places I've been before, in fact. I had a friend who was in London a few months ago, and he was supposed to meet a friend of his at the British Natural History Museum, and the friend didn't show up, and he was upset, and I said, "Well, why don't we do this? The entire Natural History Museum is completely laid out virtually. I can jump in there, we start WhatsApp, and we chat as you walk along the exhibits," and we did, and it worked great. You know, he said it was, in a fun way, it was kind of like having someone there you couldn't see because sometimes we'd step into a room like, "Oh my goodness, look at that whale skeleton," or, "Oh wow, did you see that, that Neanderthal exhibit?" One time it messed up because apparently an exhibit had been swapped out since this virtual walk was done, so I was going on about some really cool artifact, and he goes, "I have no idea what you're talking about," and I had to describe to him what I was seeing, which wasn't what he was seeing.

And aside from 360 videos and visiting places, I don't use it that much anymore. Even though this is a really cool device, and I actually even bought, um, since I wear glasses, I bought prescription lenses that go inside that just clip on, and it's really awesome because I don't have to keep my glasses on when I'm using it, even though I look at things in quote "the distance." So, it's really a lot more comfortable, but still, this thing is tiresome to wear. It doesn't have any plugs, it doesn't have a battery plug, I don't have to hook to my PC unless I'm playing certain games, but still, I find that the maximum I can probably wear it is about an hour. On really warm days, it's probably less than that. It gets, I get sweaty around the silicone ring, which I put on it, used to have foam, but it has a cover I put that on so I can wipe it off. It's a very tight fitting, heavy, it pulls down. The I find this nose section, my nose isn't that big, and so it leaves a big gap, and I can see light coming in from there, and it doesn't really rest here, so I have to tighten the head strap so it really pushes hard against my head so it stays in place, otherwise, it'll fall down here. Yeah, that gets tiresome.

Also, this thing required, when I first got it a year ago, it required a Facebook account, which I didn't have. I deleted all social media in 2016, for reasons, good reasons, but this required a Facebook account, had to be a Facebook account, so I had to create a Facebook account that I didn't have and didn't want, for no other reason than to register this. It seems to do nothing with my Facebook account that I wanted to do anything with. I don't want to download my friends list to it; I just want to do some VR apps. Then a few months after I got it, they switched everything to meta accounts, which I didn't have and didn't want, so suddenly I had to create a whole new account and get everything migrated over, including purchases I made. It was, it was user hostile, hostile the process. I didn't want to do it, but I did want to keep using this, so I did it, but it kind of just left this bad taste in my mouth of you're making me do stuff, and I know the engineers don't care about it. It feels like a marketing thing, and so that just left a bad taste in my mouth.

And let me just say that, oh my God, the ads. They mail me stuff, which I think I finally got to stop. I finally figured how to unsubscribe from that but not updates, so it would stop telling me when things were on sale and other new apps were available. But it used to be when I turned it on, I was sitting in the scenario that I had to find, which was, it used to be this mountaintop outdoor patio thing, for a while it was, um, Moria at its height before it was destroyed. I'm sure it was a rings of power ad, but it looked gorgeous, it had a waterfall and everything. 

**Apps**

Now when I started up, it's got to pop up for, I guess, apps that are available. I barely look at it; I immediately close it, but the next time I put the helmet on, there it is. That also leaves a bad taste in my mouth. It's like I paid a lot for this, and I don't need to

 have ads thrown in my face every single time I put on my hand. Like I said, find a new communication method, people will jam it full of ads again. It makes me think somebody at Facebook or meta marketing said, "I'm gonna be super clever." What all it's doing is pissing me off, and I'm sure pissing other people off, because the bottom line is, and the biggest con of this at all is, there's no real must-have apps. There's nothing that made me go, "Yeah, I gotta get a VR helmet to play this, this app." There are some good apps and some good games on it. No games have really hooked me, though. There's good ones, but nothing, you know, I only played for an hour. I'm not gonna play. I tried out Skyrim VR, it's super cool, it looks really wild to be in Skyrim as 3D. I'm not going to play that thing for hours a day because this is just too tight and heavy on my head.

What do I do with this? So, what's my current use of VR? There are two apps I use frequently, one of which was getting me to come in every day. The first one is called Wander. Wander has scraped all the 3D street view and user 3D photos from Google, and I think they did it legally, but um, Wander, it basically shows you a map, and it shows you everywhere you can go, and it's got really good coverage. You can go most museums, you can walk around, meaning you can drop yourself in and then move in the 3D View. Most cities, you can drop yourself into, including a certain capital city of North Korea, which I was really surprised, and it's interesting to go there and go, "Wow, this is what Pyongyang looks like." I was surprised. I have gone all over the United States, uh, Central and South America, tons of places in Europe. I finally got to stay out at the base of the Great Pyramid of Egypt and, uh, in Cairo, and look up. By the way, there's a Pizza Hut nearby you can go to that has a great view of the pyramids. That made me laugh. I have been all over Australia, which was super fun because I've been to Sydney a few times. I've been through Japan and China, uh, Antarctica, there's Greenland, Iceland, it's Farfall Bar, it's Far Bard Island where the seed vault is, been there, walked around, it's really cool.

The other thing I, uh, do a lot is, because every YouTube premium account, there are a lot of 360 videos on there, where you start them up, and it just surrounds you entirely, so you can sit in this chair and look around in every direction, and, you know, I've done hang gliding and scuba diving, things I wouldn't do in real life, I've done with this, and it's really cool. Another Thing YouTube is really good for is if there's something I want to watch, and it's on YouTube, this can make, I can make it look like I'm in a big room watching it on an IMAX theater, it's green, it's huge. I've done that for some things too, really good use of this again. More than an hour is probably my limit. I think I have watched an hour and a half movie on it, that's about it.

My current take on VR is, it's not there yet. This needs to be lighter, have a longer battery life, not have to be tethered at all to a computer, and just way more comfortable to wear. However, even if it gets all that, I really think AR is what I would use more. I want to be in reality, but if, if I could sit in my living room, and it made it look like there was a giant TV there with AR glasses, that's what I prefer. If I could sit at a table and it looked like several friends were there, and we were playing D&D on my table with virtual dice, and my friends are virtual, and the map is virtual, and I can see maybe if I'm the DM, I can see DM stuff that they can't see, that would be great. That would be amazing. But we are a long way away from doing that in AR. When that happens, though, I'll be there.

So, that's kind of what I think about VR right now. I've never made anything for it. I've never really, I don't really, any, I don't think any ideas really make me go, "That has to be done in VR." I think any of the ideas I have for games could be done better on a PC or a console, but who knows, that may change. Like I said, VR helmets are getting better, literally every generation, so a few more years, there may be a really awesome VR helmet. But today, this is not that year. Anyway, that's what I think about VR.

What I Like In An RPG.md

https://youtu.be/3a9LxjNNhCc?si=o51exNoLSLY4mmIU

Hi everyone, it's me Tim. Today I want to talk about what I like in an RPG and what I mean by that is what elements do I like to see in RPGs that I play, which are unsurprisingly elements in RPGs that I made. I don't want to get into the whole what is an RPG versus what's an action game versus what's an adventure game, but I will say that the more of these elements I see in an RPG the more likely I am to like it and enjoy it and the fewer of these I see well then I lean towards not liking it and if there's too few I do kind of question whether you made an RPG. These are things that I think I've had for a long time. I remember having these discussions at Interplay in the 90s an Enterprise RPGs and some of them I question like are you sure you should be doing that that does not feel RPGs to me so I try to walk these here. I try to put them into different categories and then talk about in each category. So let's start with making a character.

So I prefer RPGs that only let me make one player character. I've broken this rule. I did it in Bard's tale. I broke that rule in Temple of Elemental Evil, but it was because those games kind of had an expectation that they would be like that. The reason I prefer one character is a whole bunch of reasons: immersion, you know, I am this character, this is me running around the world. Later on, when I talk about story reaction well if you have one character that's what the story is reacting to. If you can make a whole party of characters and they're all vaguely you, then the story has to react to all of them and what if you have a Paladin and an assassin in the same party how's it supposed to be reacting to that? And finally, I like replayability in RPGs and I feel like you get more of that if you're restricted to make one character because then you have to play that character and build that character a certain way and the game should react to that character so that it's fun to go back and make a different character for replayability.

So that factors into the next thing I want when I'm making characters. I want a really, really rich creation system and that means I don't care if it's attributes, skills, traits, perks, backgrounds, itemization, whatever you let me do to my character. I want to be able to make a wide variety of characters, a huge variety. Now I understand that I can't make everything and that makes sense. I mean, in Fallout I don't let you make Superman, but I want to be able to make any character that reasonably could exist in that world and I want to play them that way and your character creation system is that first step, that's where you present to me hey look at all the things you might want to do. So you've got to really have that rich upfront creation system. Part of that is I want to name my character. I don't mind if he gets a nickname or something because you want NPCs to refer to him a certain way and they're they have voice over and so you you can't voice over every name I know games have tried to do that, but I just want to be able to name my character and this is one of the first I shouldn't say arguments but long discussions I had at Interplay because Stone keep didn't let you do that and I remember thinking we're veering towards Adventure game here like it's an adventure game with hit points because you're not letting me make my character. It also means that this is a little different than the rich creation system. I don't like when I'm already provided a role the more exacting the role the less I like it like if you like Arcanum starts and it said you were just going to that continent to look for a job so you can make any kind of character you wanted who knows why you were going to Torrent on that blimp maybe you were gonna go be a mage assistant maybe you're gonna be work on the train system maybe you were just going to be a reporter at the paper it doesn't matter it's not defined have fun with it but the more the game up fronts your background into the character creation system I don't like it. Fact I also have a role that I've told several design colleagues you get one use of Amnesia one use it wisely and then stop using it. It is a Trope I'm done with. I'm tired of making a character who like I have no idea who I am and how I got here I bumped my head or whatever. Tired of that. I also don't like player VO. I get that a lot of people do, but I don't because unless you can provide a huge range of player VO you're basically telling me my character sounds like this and talks like this and has this intonation which makes me think they have a certain personality and you've just taken all this agency away from me. It's frustrating. Wow, I just spent five minutes to edit all I'm talked about so far is character creation so let's get into progression.

Kind of the twin to character creation I want a very rich progression system and I mean I want lots of ways for this character to advance. It doesn't mean it has to be levels although that's a really good way of tracking it and it what it means is more than just my hit points go up or my skills get a little better. I win advancement through skills and perks and items maybe my items get better when I go up a level or I can craft better items or I can buy better items or I can find better items. Advancement can be done in so many ways and I really like it when advancement is gated through choices the players previously made like perks that have a skill prerequisite those are awesome because you can choose what skills to advance as you play the game but then you might see like oh this perk is not available to me because I'm just not that good with handguns. I also like uh things that become available perks or items if you join a faction and get them to like you. I like that because it's the game basically saying here is a progression path for your character that really depends on what you're doing and how you're acting it's player progression is really a way of rewarding the player so I love tying it into how they're acting because it's one of the richest this is a consequence for your action that I can think of which actually gets me to story.

I want stories that react to me the player character. I know I've talked about this in other videos but I don't like it when a narrative designer writes a whole story and it's all written and decided upon before I ever even started the game exactly what what I go through and how it went. I hate that why don't I just watch a movie it's far better probably has better special effects it's probably got a better told story because the pacing is controllable. It's strange to me that our there are RPGs out there that don't have Choice points in their storyline that allow the story to go down different branches. Um I now I talked about the football model and a few videos back where you can do different things and it leads to the same Choice point but that choice Point feels different because of the context you got there like you got that key and you got into that dungeon but did you kill to

 get it did you steal it uh did you buy it did you convince the person to give it to you did you do a quest for them and make them really friendly to you so they gave it to you those are all wildly different ways of getting that key which is what you need to advance the storyline but the context comes with it and if the game World reacts to that context then even though they all Converge on that point there's wildly different context for that point and that gets me to like different factions that's why I like having different factions that reacted differently to what you do so you do something and maybe one faction likes it the other faction gets upset that's interesting because it makes you have to make a choice. I like that games have multiple endings. I mean trust me on this I love the multiple endings in games and I'll talk more about that later but if your story only has one ending it makes me wonder why I chose to do different things on the way to that ending and then finally that brings me to the other thing about story is that story needs to be completable no matter what kind of character I made doesn't mean every character is easy to get to the end of that story but if I make a character that I decide is Mr. Talkie and he's really bad with weapons and he's really bad at sneaking and I get to the end of your game and I can't finish it because you decide to throw a giant robot at me that doesn't even talk and I need to fight it not sure I like that in fact we made very sure because there was a giant robot at the end of that world that there were other solutions to either defeat it or debuff it a lot before you attacked it and that's why which gives me different play stops.

Way back in Fallout we talked about the combat, dialogue, and stealth playthrough so you just fighting everything, killing everything is fighting the dialogue one is try to talk your way past as many encounters as you can and then the stealth path is avoid the encounters sneak past them steal things from them find alternative ways into places but in outer worlds I explored a fourth one called leadership which is you might want to do any one of those or multiple ones of those but you do it by getting companions that are really good and help you do those things so you yourself it may not be good at stealth but you're a good leader and you have a stealthy guy in your in your group by the way that's the kind of group I like making which unlike Temple where you made all your characters at the beginning I like what pillars did where you made one character and that's you and then you gather a party as you play that if I was going to make a d d game now I'd probably do that but that isn't the only play Styles you have to support I mean there's an exploration Play style we talked about it a little bit um when I talked about WildStar where we had an Explorer path that was a really interesting path because it's not quite stealth it includes parkour it includes um being able to detect alternate paths either because they're hidden or they're natural so like you can see you notice at cave entrance and other people don't see it just looks like Stone to them that's a really cool play style that could be explored a lot more you know with this goes like parkour and um Outdoorsman and you know nature observation skills those are really cool things that could be put in a game and make an entire play path called exploration where you get most of your XPS and you advance the storyline through just exploring the environment and learning all the secrets that are in it I like that. One side effect of it it's neither creation or progression so I put it in some category and that was no forced alignment I don't like games that make you be the good guy or I don't even like games that make you be the bad guy either I don't want to have to be good or bad I want to be able to do good and bad or decide if I want to be good and bad the the we did this a lot in Fallout and in Arcanum too we made situations and therefore quests that were morally gray there was no perfect way to do it there may not even be a correct way to do it no matter how you do it there are some people thought you did it good some people thought you did it bad I talked about you know you made me piss off one faction another one likes you those are good as long as when you get into it you kind of know okay I know what's going to happen if I solve this as long as you're forced to deal with the consequences of your actions in an RPG I like that getting away doing something and getting away with it scott-free should be rare like I get it if you kill someone and you're super stealthy and no one sees you do it okay but if you steal something and you sell it eventually those people are going to know it's stolen and they may eventually find out it's you and I think that's cool I like that eventually my actions catch up to me whether they're good or bad.

And that brings me to game endings which I kind of touched on earlier where I like multiple endings and that doesn't just mean multiple ways of defeating the last encounter sometimes I like that there's multiple completely more different ways for a game to end um particularly like ending slides I've used them in a lot of my games because I like the fact that we're going to tell the player the game's over and you got your ending and you did your ending your own way but now let me tell you what all of your actions are gonna do over the next few days and weeks and months and years in this area you just played through because that's really encouraging players especially then to replay because you look at it and you go oh yeah maybe I should have killed everybody in that town or maybe I should have fixed their their water pump before I stole their water tip and then if a lot of games just end there but if the game lets you keep playing I want to see the consequences to my choices in that world so don't end and maybe give me slides and then go you want to keep playing and then I go back in the world and nothing's different I want factions that are upset with me I want factions that have gained more power I want different Random Encounters in different areas because you've changed the balance of things or you've wiped out all of something in an area and other things have moved in these are things that I think should happen in an RPG if you let people keep playing past the story ending in fact I will put on my list I have a whole discussion of how to do stories and MMOs that talks about just that thing but anyway that's something I love in endings of RPGs.

Okay, that was an awful lot so in summary I like to make my own character, I like Rich progression, I like a story that reacts to me, I like variety of play style, I like no forced player alignment, and I like ending consequences if you got those good chance I like your game if you don't have all of those the less you got the less I like. Hope you like that.

What Is An RPG

Youtube Link:
https://youtu.be/XSKxD6v06P4?si=lWDfZTWkrM-VgYtd

Hi everyone, it's me Tim. Today, I want to talk about what is an RPG. Yes, I'm going to wade into this minefield of trying to define what a role-playing game is, at least on a computer. I see people talk about this all the time. People look at some games go, "that's not an RPG," and look at other games go, "that's the quintessential RPG." And my whole career, and even before my career, I always viewed RPGs as a continuum, that there are some games that are more RPG-like and others that are less, especially lately when games are coming out that people say have RPG elements. I'm like, okay, they never really define RPG elements, but they talk about it.

So, what I want to do is now that I've said okay, I think RPG is a term that defines a continuum of games, I want to talk about what that continuum is, and you can think of this as a checklist of game features, and the more of these features you have, the more I would consider you an RPG, and then I'll talk about how other people view this when I'm done.

So, I'm going to start my checklist off. These are in a particular order, but I'm not going to tell you what the order is until I'm done because I want you just to listen to the checklist. So, these are game features that I think make a game an RPG:

- The first one is that I can make my own character, including naming my character. Now, I think this is pretty important, and I because I think character creation choices should matter. I'm not saying that they should be incredibly limiting, but they should be reflected somewhere in the game as this decision you made is what is causing this. Now, this can be everything from the class you chose to the race to the gender to your attributes to your background to your skills. Something in the game should be checking that choice you made and changing. Now, for gender, it could be as simple as how people refer to you, as whether they say he or him or her or now they. It's not a big deal; it's just that's a small thing. In some of my games, I made it a bigger deal, where your gender controlled what attribute bonuses you started with, and I felt like as long as that was balanced, that was fine. Some people didn't like that; that's okay. I find, though, that if a character creation has too few of these, and notice I didn't even mention appearance, a lot of games that spend so much time on appearance, especially games where I'm never going to see my face, but they I spent an hour making my face. If those things don't really matter to me, like if what the choices I make on my appearance aren't going to matter, I'm far less interested in them. So, games of mine that did have those appearance changing things, somebody else wanted it, and I'm like, okay, I don't want to spend too much resources on this, but okay. I want those character creation choices to matter.

- Similarly, once you're playing the character, I want the player character to have a lot of choices on how to act. So, this is once you're created, the choices how you act in the game should matter. This can be high level, like whether you decide to do combat or stealth or dialogue or have companions versus playing solo, to basically what your character does moment to moment. Are you shooting people? Are you stealing things? When you go into the dialogue, do you insult them, or do you try to be nice? I want the game to recognize those choices and react to them.

- Similarly, the third thing I'd look for is that the story is reacting to my character selection to a small extent. I don't want the story to be too dependent on things you chose when you had no idea what was going on, but also to the actions you have in the game. Now, those are kind of tied together. If you decide to get a bunch of thief skills, you're probably going to steal stuff, and then there's going to be reflection, but I find it hard to believe that somebody would pick those skills and then go, "I had no idea people would be mad that I'm stealing their stuff." So, you have to take a little responsibility even at the beginning of the game to go, "H, if I take that skill to shoot people or to steal their stuff or to say rude things to them, I'm going to have to handle the consequences for that."

- The fourth thing about concern story still, which is I want it to be nonlinear. I would prefer if I could do things in the order I want to do them. I want to go where I want to go, do what I want to do, and the game should react to that. It's why I say in a lot of my interviews, I prefer a player-driven story, not a story-driven game. A story-driven game is some narrative designer decided this is how the story is gone to unfold, and you will play this way. I don't like that. I like player-driven story, where there's a lot of story elements out there ready to be activated, and the player comes along and activates the ones based on their actions.

- And then the fifth thing, the last thing I'll talk about story is I wanted to have multiple endings. If I can do things in different orders and the game is reacting to me based on what I'm doing, I totally expect that there should be different endings, and sometimes I'm talking dramatically different endings, like a good ending, a bad ending, a sad ending, a happy ending, an ending with all my companions, um, and what happened to them. Those are what I'm talking about when I'm talking about different endings. I don't mean it's dramatically different, like in this one you saved the town and this one the world blew up. I don't need that dramatic of a difference, but I do want multiple endings that reflect what you did.

That kind of gets me into gating, but I'm not just talking about story gating. I'm talking about area gating, character advancement gating. I want that based on character choices, not designer choices. And let me give you some examples of what I mean by that. Let's say you have a dungeon, and you don't necessarily want the players going in there right away. I'm fine if it's like, you need a key to get into the dungeon, or you need a passphrase to get into the dungeon. I'm even fine if it turns out that the character that has the key or the pass phrase doesn't even spawn in until later in the game or is in some hard to find place, so that you're kind of making it so I don't want the character, the player character, to go in there until a higher level. What I don't like is if the door is hardcoded, like you cannot enter here until act three. And I've played games recently that I like that. I step onto a continuation of the map, and it says, "Nope, you can't go here yet because of your level or because of the story act." And that's another thing, like if I went up to a door and it said, "You have to be at least 10th

 level to open this door," I'd be like, that is the designer like slapping me in the face directly. I'd rather have it be something embedded in the game itself, a key, a passphrase, an item, something. Similarly, now that's something how to gate story or area, but character advancement, I feel the same way about. I prefer that perks that have prerequisites on a skill being at a certain level or you buying a previous perk. I'm less a fan of perks that are just level gated, like you are not allowed to get this perk until you're level 10. Now, if you want to do that, you can always say, "You can't pick perks on this tier until you've picked at least three other perks," and since you know you get a perk every other level, no one's going to be doing that until they gain six levels. That's fine, but I don't like just having it say, "Skill level, you have to be level 10 to pick this perk." Again, again, it's the designer imposing on the player rather than the player's choices imposing on the player. It sounds really narrow, this definition, but one is the player seeing choices they make which will open up options versus the designer just going, "You can't do that till level 10."

So, I see that. Then the final thing I want to talk about is the world itself. I want the world to be big enough to support exploration and all this player choice I've mentioned and lots of adventures that aren't the main story. I like it when the world's big enough that you can have lots of side quests, and maybe you can't do all of them, maybe some of them are gated by the choices you made, or maybe some of them react, they're available, but they react to the choices you made. You kind of can't do that in a really small, narrow world, so I want a big world for the player to run around in.

Now, I said I wasn't going to talk about the order. That's basically my checklist, by the way. That's a checklist. If you have all those, you're an RPG. As you start to remove some, you're less and less of an RPG to me. Notice the order I went in. I went systems, story, setting. That is exactly the opposite of how I tell you to make your game. When you're designing a game, I tell you to go setting, story, system. The reason I went this way is this is often how games present themselves. The player is usually thrust into character creation and needs to know what these systems are. It's what's thrown at them first. Then they start playing, and they quickly learn, if not from a cinematic before, after they made their character, as soon as they get into the game, what kind of story they're going to be thrust into. Are you the chosen one, are you some amnesiac trying to find out who he is, are you trying to find this magic special item? And then, as you play, the setting unfolds, and even though you had a rough idea of what it might be, this is a fantasy world, you start to learn, oh, this is a fantasy world where all the dwarves disappeared, or this is a fantasy world that's having an industrial revolution. You walk through what that means. It's you may have heard it, you may have seen it on the back of the box, but you learn what that is as you're playing. So, it's an interesting thing that it didn't even occur to me that the order I told designers to make a game in is often the opposite order in which it unfolds to the player.

Now, many people disagree on what's an RPG and what isn't an RPG. Some of it comes down to how many things on my checklist that require, some require all of them. If you're missing one, you are no longer an RPG. Some just require some of them, but they're hard choices. Those features are demanded, like I don't require all of these, but you have to have like one, two, and five, and if you don't have that, you're not an RPG. And then there are other people like me who go, well, the more of these you have, the more RPG-like you are, and the less of these you have, the less RPG you are. And people sometimes weight them differently too, like you're more of an RPG if my choices matter. You're slightly less of an RPG if I can't make my character at the beginning, so they weigh them differently. And then, of course, some people have things that aren't even on my list, and they're like, nope, you have to have this, or you're not an RPG, or here are some additional things that I look for in my RPGs. And those are fine. Like I said, I view the space of RPGs as a continuum. You can call them hard RPGs, soft RPGs, you know, hardcore versus you know, casual, whatever you want to call them. Some people even say once you don't have enough of these, this becomes an adventure game or a shooter with RPG elements, and the elements, the off the checklist that it does have.

The only thing I would say is don't get too hung up on this. Like all things that are continuum, the dividing line which you think is hardcoded and set in stone isn't as hardcoded as you thought. And if you're wondering what I'm talking about, I'm going to link the video below where I tell my little DND Coen about day and night, and that should tell you why I feel making a hard line in the sand about this is an RPG and this isn't is doomed to fail. So, if you're trying to do that, you're not going to be successful, but that checklist I just said is my list of what I think makes an RPG. The more of them you have, the more I'll call you an RPG, the less of them, the less of an RPG you have until finally you're not an RPG anymore. And that's my thoughts on what is an RPG.

What Is Fun

Youtube Link:
https://youtu.be/IhF-8-5S5OE?si=u2ApwvrFUbn5j8Yr

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim. Today, I want to talk about fun. I've already done a video, and I'll link it below, about balancing fun and realism in games, but I've got a lot of fun-oriented questions. People want to know what I think about fun versus balance, what I think about games that force you to go what the designer considers to be the fun path, or just what is fun. Define fun. I'm going to take a stab at it, same way I took a stab at defining what an RPG is. Let's see how this goes.

First of all, let's talk about fun versus balance. I don't think anybody's going to be surprised that I prefer fun over balance in any of my games, and you can even see some of my games were really unbalanced. Sometimes certain skills or certain classes you could take were just a lot easier than others. I don't think anybody thinks the Naratu is easy to play in Bloodlines. Um, a lot of people think the Mages are much easier than Gunslingers in Arcanum. Um, but notice that doesn't talk about whether or not it's fun; it's talking about whether it's easy, which opens another can of worms about skills and what people think is easy versus what other people don't think is easy.

But let's just look at balance for a second. I think balance is really, really important if you're making a multiplayer game, whether it's PVP or not. If a bunch of people are playing together, if it's PVE (player versus environment), it's really not fun if one of the character, one of the player characters, can have a lot more fun than another one because their skill either because their skills are more broadly useful or they picked a class that's required and everybody wants them, or any number of reasons. And if it's PVP, balance is probably the most important thing because if you have players attacking players and you have one class that can trump every class, or you have one skill that is unblockable and beats everyone else, everyone's just going to take that class or buy that skill, and then that kind of defeats your whole purpose of having a bunch of different classes and skills. So, I do think balance is important in multiplayer, but in single-player, not so much.

Um, I know people will go, "But that will leave people will find ways to play OP." Okay, that's fun. And people go, "Well, they find ways of min-maxing their characters." Great, if you found some way of putting together a really unusual character that has a huge damage output or barely can take damage or can kill things in one hit, great. Similarly, if you make a really cool, we used to call them glass cannons, where you make a character that has a high damage output but if it takes one hit they're dead, some people like those. It's a challenge; it's like putting your game on high difficulty or Iron Man mode, knowing that you're playing a character that has this huge restriction.

I used to play in GURPS, um, they used to call him Johnny One Spells. It was a mage who put all of his points into just one spell, so maybe you could cast flame jet or maybe you could cast, you know, ice, an ice explosion spell or something, but you put all your points into it, which meant you were really, really good at casting it. You, you never missed, it always went off, it didn't cost a lot of mana, et cetera, et cetera. It's all great until you walk, if say you pick flame jet, it's great until you run into a fire elemental that doesn't take any damage from fire. Well, guess what, that Johnny One Spell is useless.

So, I get why people want to talk about fun and balance, but if it's a single-player game, I don't really want to dictate to that player what fun is. I don't want to tell them how to play the game. That's the whole point of me talking about player agency and player choice and consequence. I'd instead go, have fun playing the game, and half of playing the game is not just exploring the world but is exploring the mechanics, and if you find things in the mechanics that you find especially fun, great.

Um, now let's talk about forcing the fun way. Um, people were talking about games that the designer obviously thought a certain way was the best way or the fun way to play, and they make you play that way. I think if you watch any of my videos, you're going to know I hate that. I do not like forcing the player to play any way. That's why I allow people to kill everyone without even talking to them. It's why I try to do pacifist playthroughs. It's why I make sure that no matter what skills or classes you buy, your character can still finish the game. May not be easy, but for all I know, you find some unusual way to be fun, so who am I to tell you no, play this way, this is the only fun.

If you played my Temple of Elemental Evil game, you know that when you end the game, there's a bunch of different things you can do at the end. Did you kill Zuggtmoy, the queen of fungi? Maybe, maybe you killed her because you were good, maybe you killed her because you were evil. But, uh, maybe you were evil, and you joined her. Maybe she was wrecking you in the final combat, and she said "join me or die," and you're like "okay, I'll join." Why not? That's what an evil group might do. Or maybe you were so evil, and you were crushing her that maybe she decides to give in to you. She surrendered to you. Sure, be your vassal. Why not? That sounds like fun. It's probably really unbalanced because if we had a sequel Temple of Elemental Evil, and you had Zuggtmoy as a party member, okay, that's going to be a little unbalanced. But it was a fun way to end the game, I thought it was great.

Similarly, I did a video on quest markers. Some of you hate quest markers. You're like, "I hate it. I don't want them in my game. It takes away all the joy. You play the HUD, you play the UI." I get it; it's a totally reasonable thing. Then some of you required them. You're like, "Look, I'm not, I don't have time. I work a full-time job. I have kids. I sometimes won't play the game for a month at a stretch. I need a quest marker to tell me where to go. If you don't provide them, I move on to the next game." Totally reasonable.

Now, I thought a reasonable compromise was to make them an option, and then many of you pointed out, and I think it was a totally good thing to point out, that if you make it an option, it's harder to playtest a game. I agree, because now you have have to playtesters have to play it with the quest markers on, and the other half to play them with them off, just to make sure everything's still do

able. But it also means me that the quest should be solvable without quest markers, meaning the quest giver tells you enough information that you could go figure out how to do the quest, and that that information is put in your journal, so that if you come back to it the next day, or the next week, or the next month, you still have that information. Some games get around that by just recording every dialogue you ever have, and so there's a tab in your journal called previous dialogues, and you can just scroll through transcripts. That's a great way too, especially if it has search in it. I prefer though it to be linked directly to the quest in the quest log. We kind of did that in Arcanum.

So, to me, that is about the only way to achieve consensus, is to have optional quest markers and really well-defined quests so you don't need them, but if you want them, they're there. Because any other decision is you telling the player, here's how you are going to have fun.

Now, that probably brings me around to what's fun. What is fun? I struggled with this, and I just did the one about, you know, the video about how to define an RPG, but I struggled with fun. It's like a lot of things in life; it's really hard to define fun the same way it's hard to define happy. Um, a lot of kids are happy, but if you ask them why they're happy, or even that they are happy, they don't know, they just are happy. Happy. Similarly, you're playing a game, and it's fun, and if someone says, "Why is it fun? Define them why it's fun." I don't know, it's fun.

It's, I often fall back on that famous definition of porn, which is "I can't define it, but I know it when I see it." If you haven't heard this, here, like Tim Story Time, Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart said the following line about obscenity in a case he had to look at in 1964 about a theater showing a movie that the local officials thought was pornography, and they stopped him under Ohio's obscenity law. And here's what Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart said: "I shall not today attempt further to define the kinds of material I understand to be embraced within that shorthand description, and perhaps I could never succeed in intelligibly doing so. But I know it when I see it."

I'm the same way about fun. I've played a ton of games. I know what fun is. I can tell when a game is fun. I can tell when a game isn't fun, but I probably can't define it. I certainly can't give a really shorthand description of fun in a way that hundreds, or not thousands of you, could not rip apart and come up with counterexamples. So, I'm not going to try to do that. But what I will say is this: Ultimately, whatever the game director or lead designer thinks is fun, that's what's fun in that game. The reason I like emergent play, and I'll link that below, is sometimes fun is somewhere no one thought of. It's at an intersection of a bunch of rules, and fun comes out of it. So, while ultimately, I think the game director is the person responsible for fun, so in other words, they take credit if you think you have the, if you think a game is fun, and spread it among the team, but they be responsible and take the blame if you don't think it's fun. Ultimately, I think whatever director thinks it's fun is what's fun. Probably not the answer you wanted. I think it's the best answer I can give. So, that's fun.

What Makes A Good Game.md
Youtube Link:
https://youtu.be/_1jZuasGDn8?si=abpBqCa4DCkos003

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim. Today, I want to talk about what makes a good game. It's a loaded question, but I'm going to try to look at it objectively at first. There's a lot of people online that make comments about whether a game is good or bad, and wow, do they sound objective. They make it sound like their opinion on this game being good or bad is the final word, there can be no disagreement. They prove it with metrics of some kind, so I'm going to walk through those, how I've seen people talk about a game is good or bad. Let's talk about good ones for now. A game is good because it's popular, it's best-selling, it's got great reviews, it's got a long playtime, it's super original. Let's walk through those.

And because I don't like talking about other people's games in a good or bad light, I'll talk about my own. So, let's try to figure out what my best game is. Let's talk about popularity, and by popularity, I don't mean that people are saying this is a good game, therefore it must be popular. I'm talking about there's a lot of articles about it, there's a lot of playthrough videos about it, there are a lot of online comments about it. If it's an online game, it's got a lot of concurrent users, basically it's popular, it's in the social Zeitgeist, is that what the word is? People basically know what it is, talk about it a lot, it is well known. Among all my games, if I had to pick one, It's gotta be Fallout. I'm no known more for Fallout than anything else I've ever made, and this occurred even before Bethesda got the rights to it and even before I think Fallout 2 came out. Fallout went out and just hit some kind of gaming nerve in a good way. And it's just a lot of people started talking about it, it was really cool. I remember talking with people on the team like, "Did you expect this?" and some people were like, "Oh yeah, I always knew this is going to be good," and other people were like, "What's going on?" But that makes Fallout my best game because it's popular.

But let's talk about sales, which is by a lot of measurement a far more objective and quantifiable number than popularity. Sales is literally how many units of this were purchased. By this metric, The Outer Worlds is my best game by far, by a huge order of magnitude, and that's even with it being on Xbox Game Pass, meaning there's a whole chunk of people who never bought it who, based on their playtimes of it, would have. So even accounting for that, Outer Worlds is, I mean, I think my next best-selling game is one-tenth that amount. So if you're using sales as an argument, Outer Worlds is my best game ever.

What's interesting is I've seen people use sales as an argument to support a good game. I've also seen them at then use it as an argument against a game being good. I've even seen some of the same people use that argument both ways. The way they use it as a bad thing is they see, well if a game has high sales, it's a casual game, it's not a real hardcore game, or the people buying it are a bunch of Muppets, to steal a term from Eric DeMille. So I've seen people use sales as an argument for good or bad games, but in general, if you make a game and it sells a lot, it's kind of hard to argue it's a bad game. It sold a lot, ultimately that's the purpose of a game. It is a product, ultimately. I also think it's art, but takes money to make it, it should bring in money. Sales are a good metric of that.

But here's something to think about. I've been doing this for over four decades, the market has gotten huge, like multiple orders of magnitude bigger. So is it really even fair to compare the sales of Fallout to the sales of The Outer Worlds because the time difference between those games is 20 years, 30 years, 20 years? That's a huge Delta. The market is so much bigger, so even if you make a game that the same percentage of gamers want to play, You're going to sell a lot more now. So maybe sales isn't a good idea.

So let's look at review scores, also something that's fairly easy to quantify, even though some reviewers go 0 to 100, some go zero to ten, some go zero to five, some of you thumbs up and thumbs down. Ultimately, those get converted into numbers on places like Metacritic, so for whatever reason, we can look at these as numbers. In terms of pure scores, my highest-rated games are tied between Fallout and Pillars of Eternity, both of them got an 89. I have never made a game that has made it into the 90s. The 90s are a tough thing to break into, it means that almost every review score really liked you, and some of them gave you perfect numbers to offset people who may have given you in the 80s. It's really hard to get into the 90s, kind of wish I had, but I didn't. My second highest-rated game that I worked on was Fallout 2, and that came in at an 86. And then rounding off the top five are South Park: The Stick of Truth and The Outer Worlds, both of which came in at 85.

Now, a lot of people would argue whether those are my best games. I mean, Bloodlines isn't there, Arcanum isn't there, those scored a lot less. It's one of those things that you may then turn around and go, "Well, I don't agree with those reviewers," which is why I always recommend if you want to use reviewers as a prediction of whether you're like a game, what you should do is take a bunch of games that you've already decided you'd like and hate, and I think it's important to have games in both of those groups, then find a reviewer who already has reviewed those games and agrees with you in score and in reasons. So read the reviews, if you can find a reviewer that scores them the same way you do and for the same reason, I think you're pretty good at using that reviewer to predict future games. I do that, I think it's a smart way of doing it, rather than just look at review aggregates because then you're going to end up with, I still remember one of my games got reviewed by somebody who started their review, "I don't really play RPGs, I don't like them, but now let's talk about this RPG." So that's how I handle reviews.

Another metric you can use for whether a game is good is the length. Personally, I don't think this is a good metric, but at least it's numerical and, in many cases, unarguable, even though sometimes people go, "Do you mean length by main story or length by all the content including side quests and everything else?" If you use length as a metric, technically Bard's Tale Construction Set is my best game because

 it is technically never-ending. You can keep making levels for it, it's basically a tool, it's a tool that's shipped without a game, although I did, we did put a mini-game in for Scare Bray. If you want to look at complete shipped games, Arcanum is by far my longest game. It is a really long game. I know people easily get 80 hours out of it, it's especially long if you consider all the side quests and you include in that all the quests for getting Mastery level in skills. In most skills, you can't do all the skills, two of them, the Masters want you to kill each other, so there's no way you're going to master both. But if you include that, Arcanum is my best game, it is by far my best game because you will get the most hours for your dollars out of that game.

Another metric that's itself subjective, it's a numerical objective measurement, but what it's measuring is itself subjective, it's original features. How original was this game? A lot of people would argue Arcanum was my most original game if you just total in features that hadn't been seen before in computer role-playing games. It was such a big game, we threw everything in there but the kitchen sink, so it's hard to argue that Arcanum doesn't have the most original features. However, you could make a case for Fallout because just looking at this game when it came out, it wasn't really like all the other games that were out. So, you know, isometric games have been made before, but they were kind of being phased out, things were going either as much, Real-Time 3D games were coming into popularity. I wouldn't say Fallout was original, but a lot of what it did in that genre was original. So some people think Fallout is the one with the most original features.

So those are all of the metrics I thought of that you could use to apply to a game. So maybe the better way to do it is if you can't figure out what a good game is, well, maybe we can all agree what a bad game is. And then you can just discount those, you're like, well, all the games after we've decided games are bad, the ones that are left must be good games. Well, by that metric, isn't Fallout and Arcanum and Vampire: Bloodlines bad games? I mean, they're all buggy, they're odd crashes, I know a lot of people saying, "I can't play it because of this," so there must be objectively bad games, right? But then a lot of people complain about Temple, which had its share of bugs but also had bad dialogue, inconsistent questing, and bad pacing. So I'm not sure declaring a game bad is going to leave you with the good ones. I think people can find something they don't like in any game, so I think it's going to leave you with nothing.

So what's my conclusion on this? It's gonna sound simple, or pedantic, depending on how you think about it, but I think a good game is just one that you like. If you like a game, it's a good game. If you don't like it, it's a bad game, which is why I recommend people play the games you like and just stop playing the ones you don't like. You can go online saying, "I'm doing a public service," and rant about games you don't like, but people may not care about the things you don't like, those features may be unimportant to them. So there could be people who love games that you hate, doesn't mean the game is good for you, doesn't mean it's bad for them, it's a good game for them, and it's a good game for you, despite whether it's popular, whether it's sold a lot, or whether it's got a high review score. If you like it, it's a good game for you. And you can extend this into books and movies, there's a whole bunch of popular, well-selling books and movies that I do not like, but I don't go ranting about them because what's the point? If you like these things, enjoy them.

So I know that sounds simple, that a good game is a game you like, but I don't think anything else people say is defensible. Nobody is the final arbiter in goodness and badness, and reading some things online where people try to pretend they are is bizarre to me. Even with reviewers, they can just say, "I didn't like this game because of these reasons," and then that leaves you, the reader, to decide if those reasons are even important to you. But I think that's what I want people always ask me, "Did you like this game? What'd you think of this?" and my opinion shouldn't matter. If you liked it, it's a good game.

When Bugs Become Features.md
Youtube Link:
https://youtu.be/2yiZHvXsXnw?si=Ub3zux-bYfxX3C4-

Hi everyone, it's me Tim, and today I want to answer another question, this time from bite your own teeth 2100. He asks, "Tim, are there any cases where you've embraced unexpected systemic reactions, or when has a bug become a feature?" Oh yes, many times. I actually love when that happens. First, let me define some stuff, and then I'll talk about some examples from my own games where this has happened, and then I'll talk about why I like it so much. That's a good question because it got me all going.

First of all, when something is defined as systemic, what that means is it's been, or at least this is how I use it, it's been coded for. I use this as opposed to something that's been scripted to be a unique case on something. There are reasons to use both of these, but whenever possible, I prefer to go systemic rather than scripts for a whole host of reasons, ironically the biggest of which is it cuts down on bugs. I say ironic because my games have had a lot of bugs in it. I often wonder what that was for. I don't think any of us were really bad game developers. I think it really boils down to we tried to put too much stuff in, both mechanics and content, with too few people to do it and too little time at the end to bug fix, but that's a whole other video.

Anyway, so systemic means you're handling en code rather than scripts, and I'll give an example of where that's really appropriate. Let's say you're going to have quest items in your game, and you've decided you want a couple of special rules for quest items. Let's say you don't want quest items to be something the player can accidentally drop. Yes, you could put this in by making a no-drop script which you can attach to any item, and then when someone attempts to drop it, that script fires and goes, "Nope, this is not allowed," and it doesn't allow it. I don't like that. I don't like that for a lot of reasons. Any quest item that's put in the game that people forget to put that script on, bug. If you decide later that when you can't drop something, you want a special message to pop up, now you got to put that in that script. If the script is a separate copy on all of them, I mean I'm assuming it's not, but if you also later decide, "Oh, I don't want it to be dropped or sold," now you have to make a new script and attach it to that object on for overriding selling. Then maybe you're like, "Wait, quest items shouldn't have weight either." You put another, you go back to every item, and you actually zero out the weight. I don't like any of this.

The biggest reason I don't like this is when you're making a game, you often make decisions later after content has been made, and you want to make sure that your decision propagates to all the existing content that's already been put in. So the way I would handle a quest item is simply have a flag that you put on an item, "This is a quest item." The designer puts it in when make the item. "This is a quest item, I'm done." The code is what handles it. The code says, "Oh, when I'm adding up all the weight in your inventory, I skip quest items." Boom, now they don't have weight. "Oh, when I'm going to sell an item or if an item is being dropped, I check the quest flag." Boom, now you can make it so that in the actual code to do those things, you make it impossible for a quest item to be sold or dropped. Trivial to make a little UI pop up or a message to appear somewhere if you decide later you don't even want quest items to appear in your inventory. When you pick them up, they show up as an icon on the quest log. Boom, easy to do. You've got the quest flag, quest item flag, you can just check it.

So that's an example of doing something systemically. You put in rules to handle that item or situation in the code and then you move on. What I love about this question is once you have a lot of those rules, they will start interacting with each other in unpredicted ways, and I think it's funny when that happens. And let me walk through some that actually happened. The first one, and I think the funniest one, happened in Fallout, where we had rules for stealing that included pickpocketing that we had it put in to intend for you to take things out of someone's inventory you were stealing from them. Barter, I just reused a UI we already had for, I think it was for Bing. I just reused that UI, and when you took something, I checked to see if someone noticed.

Well, QA discovered, because it was barter, it could go either direction. You could put something in someone's inventory, and I don't know if I thought of that. I don't think I did, but if I had, it would be like, "Okay, why would I want to give someone some money? Why would I want to give someone a gun? I don't know, maybe a quest designer will use that to plant evidence on people." But our QA people were both clever and cruel. What they used it for was placing lit dynamite or already ticking grenades into NPCs' inventories and then running away. In fact, they made a game of it. In Shady Sands, there were kids, I think they did on the kid that would walk around, they just run around playing in the background. QA made a game where they would put grenades in those kids' inventory using pickpocket, and then they scored points when the grenade went off of how many other kids were nearby. Can't say I approve of that use, but no one anticipated that, to the point where once we saw that in Fallout 1, it became a quest solution in Fallout 2 because there was someone you had to kill. Well, it was one option for the quest is to kill someone, and the way you could do it was you could, I think his kid was playing up front, you could plant a grenade or dynamite on the kid and then say, "Hey, I think your father wants you." There was actually a dialogue option to tell him your dad wants you, and he'd run in next to his dad, boom.

In Arcanum, one of the things that we didn't even discover, not me, not our external QA group, not our internal QA group, was, and this is something I read, I want to say years later, if you're traveling in the world map in Arcanum between two points, I allowed it that you could click and fall out of the world map, and it would determine what sector you were in, you were in, and generate that sector if it needed to, and plop you in. We had procedural train generation. I did a video about it. It wasn't hard. I have discovered that people were using that to get into areas they weren't supposed to be able to get into. For example, people who couldn't get into Tula, especially if they were tech,

 would just travel from one side of the world map to the other side of the world map across Tula, the city, and when they were over that sector, they'd drop in. Maybe they were outside the walls, they just do it again. Sometimes they would fall in, and they'd be in a place that wasn't legal, they'd be in like a place with no path mesh. They just do it again. Eventually, they'd get inside the city. Super clever. We never thought anybody would do anything like that. I do know some people tried to do it to get to, there was a random encounter that, I don't remember who put this in, Leonard or Chad. It was a walled area with a chest inside, and I don't think there's any way in that walled area. Well, people did that trick to get in there. Clever.

The thing that happened in Outer Worlds, I'll do one more example of this, was when you left an instance, a mapped instance, we turned off combat in that map. In Arcanum, we didn't do that. We let the anything that was angry run for a few more seconds, and if they made it to the map transition, they would pop out and keep attacking you. In Outer Worlds, we just stopped all combat. Well, I've seen people in playthrough videos jump in and out of an instance really fast. They'd step out and then step right back in just to clear that combat flag. And you may go, "Well, why bother? Why would you do that?" Well, I saw people do it in the Edgewater power plant. They wouldn't bother killing any of the auto-mechanicals, and if any of them were chasing him when they left, they'd step outside and then step right back inside. The combat would be cleared, and then they could go use the computer because you can't use a computer while combat is active. Again, I think that's clever. It is a, some not something we planned on. It's a bunch of systemic roles coming together and having that solution. It technically is a bug, but I don't mind it. Let's call it a feature.

This is why I actually talk a lot about why I prefer fun over balance, and if I make a true balance pass, I probably would take all that stuff out because they weren't planned for. We didn't plan for you to be able to place grenades in people, or drop out of the world map into places we didn't want you to get into, or clear the combat flag just so you could jump back in and do something that the combat flag was preventing you from doing. But I like that people found that. It's cool they discovered it on their own, so let him do it. That's my take on it. It's also why I think of games, and I often refer to him this way, as toys more than challenges, or simulations, or story vehicles. Games can be all that. What I view games as are toys, and I think you should play with them, and if this is how you like to do that, rock on.

So to sum up, yes, bugs become features when they're unplanned, discoverable, and fun, and I have nothing against it, and I think it's cool that people discover these. I even like it better when they post videos, which we would watch, and we'd be like, it's like speedruns, we'd watch it and be like, "I had no idea people could do that." It's just fun. So have fun with it, you have my blessing.
Title:
Why I Like Flawed Characters.md
Youtube Link:
https://youtu.be/phMzoU7DOFA?si=TXYMrN8a8v68ev_g

Hi, it's me Tim. I've gotten some great feedback on the dumb dialogue video where I talk about the origin of dumb dialogue being restrictions that I put on players in my original D&D campaign back in late 70s early 80s. So I wanted to talk about why I like flawed player characters so much and why I think restrictions lead to better role-playing and just better game playing in general.

After playing D&D in high school, I really got into GURPS in grad school, and that's where I first discovered disadvantages, which is in GURPS things you can buy for your character that aren't good but they give you more points to spend somewhere else. I always wanted to do something like that. Fallout had traits which were good things and bad things glued together, the original Fallouts did, then kind of lost that. I mean, backgrounds in Arcanum had some pros and cons, you could always lower stats. When I finally got to Outer Worlds, I realized I could leverage the same game mechanics or game code that we had in place for reactivity that was basically watching the player's behavior and events that happened to the player to make flaws. Flaws aren't really like disadvantages, disadvantages you buy when you make your character and then you're required to play that way. Flaws work the other way; you would play a certain way, the game would notice and go, do you want this flaw? Take a lot of damage from robots, maybe you have robophobia. Fall down a lot, take damage, maybe you get a fear of heights.

So I really like that because it made it more reactive, it made the game feel more reactive than it was watching you, and also it made sense, hey my player has nearly died five times from robots, maybe I have a good healthy fear of them. This is also, um, this whole idea I have of flawed characters came from a couple of philosophy books that really influenced me, both by Joseph Campbell. One's called The Hero of a Thousand Faces and the other was the book based on his PBS show about that book called The Power of Myth. And in both of those, Joseph Campbell talks about when heroes go on journeys, they face a lot of challenges, they learn that they're not perfect, they explore a new realm, they gain a lot more power or boons, and then they come back to the real world.

I really liked that, I especially like the fact that heroes had to come, um, to grips with the fact that they were not perfect people. So, that's what really originally attracted me to GURPS, and by the way, not only is it a whole other video about me talking about what philosophy books influence me, it's a whole other video about the whole GURPS special follow-up thing. But what I want to talk about today were two stories. I will always remember, this happened either right before in the very early stages of making Fallout, I was trying to teach GURPS to people at Interplay.

And there were two situations that happened with the same party. So it was Leonard Boyarsky, and Chris Taylor, and Scott Everts, and Spencer Kipe, and they had made characters with GURPS. I don't really remember Leonard's and Chris's characters, what they'd made, but the two important ones were Scotty wanted to make a really good fighter, so he wanted high health, high strength, high dex, so he sacrificed his intelligence, made it dropped it a bit, but what he really did was to give himself points, was he said he was missing an arm. I remember he said, "I'll just use a shield, or I just won't use a shield, I'll just use a one-handed weapon and no shield," and he made himself an alcoholic, which meant during the day he might start drinking. Spencer made himself a mage and just said, "I'm gonna take overweight," and he just took overweight, but he took it at its massively high level, like morbidly obese, and the disadvantage of that was one of the disadvantages was it slowed his movement rate a great deal.

So they decide they're going to go to a dungeon, a dungeon below wizard tower, you know, everybody was like there's gonna be lots of great loot yet, it's several days away so they have to camp. The first night they're camping by a swamp, they decide not to go in, too dangerous. They make a big bonfire, they're sitting around it talking, nobody's on guard. A some elemental, some swamp elemental fire beast comes out of the swamp to attack them. They quickly realized that they are way overmatched, so they make that decision that all parties do since time immemorial, and they run away. I point out that the elemental, it's pretty fast moving, and Spencer isn't. I asked them how far they run, and Chris Taylor, without missing a beat, says, "We run until we can't hear Spencer screaming anymore." Spencer got eaten by that elemental, he rolls up a new character, skinny mage, yeah, skinny's a disadvantage, it gives them other things, like I think he's he lost a little strength.

They reach the dungeon or they reached the tower, the dungeon is accessible from a trapdoor that has and then blow out our metal rung set into a wall, they're going down it, they they get there early in the morning so they're already, they've just woken up. They have all their mana, all their abilities, all their items. They're going down the rungs and I say, "Hey, rungs require two hands, it says the rules, if you only you threw it one-handed you have to make a dexterity check halfway to see if you fall." Now all of them put away their weapons and they go down two-handed, but Scotty, he's missing an arm, so he says, "I'll just make the dex check, but I've got a high dexterity," and he goes down, he makes the dexterity check, and they're in the dungeon.

They do a lot of exploring, they find rooms, they find some loot, they find a few monsters, I think they found out some blood-sucking vine and a skeleton attacks them, uh, they see someone sleeping on a bench and they just sneak by and they don't want to touch that person. They finally come to a room and there's an enormous chasm, it's so deep they can't see how deep it is, their torches don't even show anything past 30 feet as deep. While they're sitting there deciding what to do, talking loudly, something rises up out of the chasm, they can't even see it, oh it's so big, but it's really big, they see a giant beak here and a bunch of tentacles hanging down below it which reach out. Scotty swipes at one, being the fighter, turns out it's way beyond their ability, so once again they decide to run away. They reach the rungs, all of them go up, you know, Scotty's gotta hold off, hold the monster off. When it's his turn, he's like, "Okay, I'm gonna run up the ladder," I'm like, "You're one-armed and run up the rungs," and he said, "I'll make a dex check," and I

'm like, "Well, you've been down here a few hours, and you have alcoholism, have you been sipping from your flask?" He's like, uh, like you need to make a will roll, which is based on your end, isn't slow, his roll's even lower, he misses it, which means he's been drinking, which means his dex is lowered. He starts up the rungs, misses his dexterity check, falls back, and the tentacles come down the whole way, Chris Taylor at the top slowly closes the trap door. Scotty gotta eat.

So what is the lesson from this? Flawed characters are fun, flawed characters are very memorable, flawed characters introduce a lot of extra challenges into the game that the player brought. I love it. I wish more RPGs had these kind of negative aspects to a player so that by the end of the game you're not some god walking among the populace. I think it's fun, I think it's great, I think there's a ton more things that can be done in this space, I don't think in any way Outer Worlds is the end-all be-all of what you can do in this space, and I'm looking forward to see what other people do. Anyway, I just felt like telling some stories today. Bye.

Why I Play Games I Don't Like.md

https://youtu.be/Nq87YGJYXAU?si=1nqpJWUxf3Jecr2D

Hi everyone, it's me Tim, and today I want to talk about why I play games I don't like. Now, I don't review games, and I've made a whole video about it with all the reasons why I didn't review it. Please watch it if you haven't. I get lots of requests to review games or just stream myself playing it, which is going to lead to me making comments, and I don't do that. What I do want to talk about in this video, though, is first of all, I play a lot of games. I play games every day, if not, no, I'm sure I play video games every day. I think I also play at least every week a card or board or puzzle game, and sometimes included in those are ones I simply do not like. Sometimes I have many, many hours in those games that I do not like. In fact, I had to privatize my Steam account a few years ago because there were different people, colleagues, people in the industry, fans, people on Game Dev boards who would look at the hours I was putting into different games and make all kinds of assumptions about what those hours meant. And let me just tell you that many of those assumptions, many of the things they said, were absolutely wrong. The one I heard the most often was, "Wow, Tim must really love that game, look at how many hours he has in it." So let me walk through a lot of reasons you might see a huge number of hours next to a game that I didn't like.

Now, one reason you'd see a large number of hours is I did like the game, but I've played a ton of games that I absolutely did not like, and let me tell you why. Probably the number one reason, and it should be obvious, is I get paid to make role-playing games; therefore, I need to play a lot of role-playing games. Even now, as a contractor, and I have clients, I'm expected to have a well-informed opinion of competitors' games out there. Frequently, they come up in discussions; we have a Zoom meeting, and we're talking about a feature. Just yesterday, I was involved in a long back-and-forth email with several other designers at one of the clients, trying to decide whether to put feature A or feature B in their game. Now, in three of my previous games, I had used either Feature A or B, so one of the things I got to talk about was why I used feature A over feature B, like what went into my decision process to use one of those over the other. And also, what having that feature, once I decided to have that feature in the game, what that meant I really had to do in the rest of the game because that feature had side effects and connected to other things. So, and I even reminded them, I don't make the final decision; that's not what a contractor does, but I am there to provide a lot of info about my games and other games, and to talk as part of talking about that, to give a very informed opinion on these features were in this game, they did this, there were these side effects from them, they interacted with these other systems in a certain way. And frequently, it will come up where somebody would go, "Oh, I really like this game, but it didn't do this," and I'm like, "Actually, it did, but you had to unlock it." And we've had long discussions; that one time we actually went online and watched a video where I said, "Look, here's where, here's where the person's unlocking that ability." So it was interesting, but, and that led to a discussion of why would they have this ability but lock it behind a skill or a perk or something your character or a class that your character had to choose, and that led to an interesting discussion of, you can have a feature in the game, but if everyone can't use it or people don't know it's there, you know, how do you handle that.

Which brings me to the second reason I play games I don't like: sometimes I'm just curious. I'm really curious. I've heard that a game does something, it has a feature, it has some particular graphical element, it has a really cool kind of UI, and I want to see how they did it. I want to see what it looks like, what it feels like, I want to interact with that feature and see how that feature works with other systems in the game. I want to see like, was it tacked on? Because sometimes I play a game, and it feels like something was just tacked on, it's like that feature connects to nothing else in the game, it's just kind of there to be interacted with if you feel like, but it doesn't connect to other things. Sometimes features are this incredible web work or tapestry of features, threads, and I love seeing how the designers on that game made all those connections and made and balance and stuff. There's a ton to learn, even from games you don't like.

One of the reasons I may play a game I don't like is, I've played others in the series, and I kind of want to see how the series played out, and I don't always play them in order. In fact, one thing I've noticed is I have a tendency to like a game when it's the first one of the series I've played, even if I then go back and play previous ones. I tend to like the first one I played the best, and I have to keep that in mind because that's a really subjective bias. But what I also love is, after I've played all the games in a series, I love seeing how it evolved. It gives you some insight into the designers that, hey, they had this feature for a while and then they changed it, hey, this was skill-based and then became class-based, or it was turn-based and went real-time, or whatever. Sometimes it's way more subtle than that, wow, their crafting system mattered, and then, and it didn't. So I like seeing what changes got made across series, which often means playing entries in that series that aren't very good.

I'll admit, my third reason for playing bad games and putting large amounts of hours into Bad Games is sometimes it's just like a car crash to me; I can't look away. I'm just playing it, and I'm like, "Why did they do that? What led to this decision? Did they not use a focus group?" And it's like, this is why I can't stream because it would be like my own version of MST3K, although probably not nearly as funny because I will sometimes play a game, and I'll be making comments like that. I'll be like, "I don't understand, why does the designer want me to do this? It isn't fun. I don't think he wants me to do it, but all of his system mechanics are forcing me to do this," or, you know, "Why would she write a character this way? It's completely unlikable. Does she want me to hate her characters? Okay, I hate them." It's just a strange thing I have; it's a monologue, but sometimes I express it. It's funny to

 me; it's probably not funny for any of you to watch, and it certainly wouldn't be funny for the designer to watch, but there are some games that just are so bad I play them just to see it. I just want to see it. I'm like, "This passed a test? Somebody signed off on this? Somebody paid for this?"

It's another reason I play Bad Games is, it's not good, but it's good enough. Sometimes I'm just jonesing for something, I feel like playing a fantasy RPG, like a real, you know, elves and Dragons, run-of-the-mill, completely plain vanilla Fantasy game, and I find one, and it's good enough, and it scratches that itch, and I get it out of my system, and I move on. And it's not even that I would say it was a bad game, like I said, it's just, it wasn't good, it was good enough, it did what I wanted to do. Maybe I felt like playing a tabletop D and D session, and I didn't have anyone to play with, so I did this. Game did its job for me.

And then, probably the last reason I play games that are bad is, there are a few games that I put a lot of hours into it because they're comfortable. It's like this pullover; it's not the prettiest thing in the world, but it's cold today, and this is really comfortable. I have games that I play like that; they're not great, they're not the best in their class, they're not groundbreaking, they're not revolutionary, but I love them; they're comfortable. I slip into the game, and it's like, "Oh yeah, this is this game. I know what I have to do, I know what that dungeon's going to be like, I know what that Quest is going to be like," and it's just comfortable. It doesn't surprise me, it doesn't, you know, transport me to another place, it's not, it's not all that, but it's comfortable. It's like a nice old pair of jeans or a pair of sweatpants that you just like, even though they're a little ratty.

So, those are all the reasons that I play games I don't like, and there's a moral to this video. I've said this before: it's okay to not like some games, it's also okay to play some games you don't like, and it's okay to play a lot of hours into games you don't like. I see a lot of Steam Reviews where people go, "I played for 200 hours, I don't like it." I get why people do that. What I don't need to do is go online and tell everyone why I'm playing these games I don't like, or even what the games are that I don't like, because I'm sure I don't like some games that you love, and I'm sure that you know, you don't like some games that I love, and that's fine. But just because I put a lot of hours into a game doesn't necessarily mean I like it; it just means I had a reason to put a lot of hours into that game, and it's the game's quality isn't always the reason. So anyway, I hope you like that.

Work-Life Balance.md
Youtube Link:

https://youtu.be/AaHVCy_EQ0s?si=ro485EioKG3zdrmo

Hi everyone, it's me, Tim. Today, I want to talk about my thoughts on work-life balance in the game industry. This is something that's getting a lot of attention recently. A lot of people are talking about this, and I agree it's a problem. So, I'm just gonna start and end this video saying this: work-life balance is important. I've noticed some people will watch my videos and walk away with very unusual takes on what I said, so I'm gonna make that clear.

I started and stopped this video multiple times, and I've never done that. I usually sit down, think about what I want to say, do it, maybe bring up some notes to make sure I stay focused, but this one had me starting and stopping, and I finally realized what it was. Work-life balance is often portrayed as a dichotomy: work-life balance versus passion. And I think that dichotomy is false. I think work-life balance is in a period where it's being elevated way beyond maybe where it should be, and passion, meanwhile, has become kind of a negative thing, a dirty word, something that "oh, that person's too passionate, they need to get reined in."

Now, I'm saying this as someone who used to work crazy hours—12 to 14 hours a day, six to seven days a week. I did this for 10 years. I called it my lost decade, and I could talk about that, you know, what I'll talk about in another video because I will get derailed in that. I just have to say this: it is not sustainable. However, I don't think that I would have been able to make my games on a nine-to-five schedule. It just wouldn't have been possible. Fallout, for example—I mean, I was doing code and design and production—that just wasn't possible to do three jobs in a nine-to-five setting. Now, that was something I took on, so I'm not blaming anybody, but I'm saying there was something that contributed to Fallout's success. So many of us worked such long hours and did multiple roles, there were less of us, there was less communication overhead, there was more unity of purpose, and it led to what I think was a wonderful game.

And I was watching a video, an Escapist video by Yahtzee. He's very funny, I don't remember which one this was, but he said something that made me go yes. He said, "I'd rather play a bad game than play a bland game." And I remember pausing the video and going, yes, and I'd rather make a bad game than make a bland game. Some of my games, people said were bad, but I don't think any of them thought they were forgettable.

So, I've also talked about maybe those failures are what I learned from. I've talked a lot about the fact that failure gave me wisdom. It taught me what worked, what didn't, what I was good at, what I was bad at. However, there was a negative part to it. Failure gave me a kind of timidity, a concern like I'd think about something and go, hmm, I tried that before, I don't know if I should try that again, or that didn't work, or we didn't have a good time doing that. And so, sometimes I feel I don't explore as much, and I've fought against that tendency. Some people call it youthful arrogance and ignorance. I don't think it's that. I think when I was younger, I had a lot more energy, but I also thought I could do more than I could actually do. The lack of experience led me to overscope games.

The recent video I talked about mixing real-time and turn-based in Arcanum. I really thought I could do that and get it balanced and get it great. I couldn't. Or I talked about writing bad dialogue in Temple. I thought I could do that. Why? Because I wrote some stuff for Fallout. Certainly, I can just write more, and it will be more and better. No.

So, that's what experience taught me. But ignorance is a two-way street. So, I tried things without knowing how hard they would be, but I kept going anyway, and that led me into some game design spaces that led to wonderful games, even if they were over scoped, they were wonderful. And that's something that, oh, I would only do from that kind of risk.

Now, I get the modern conversation on work-life balance. People want a life. They want home life, they want kids, they want to travel, they want to do their hobbies, and I get all that. I also have to mention that there's a lot of professions that don't have that. Actors don't work nine to five. Athletes don't work nine to five. Writers, which is a very adjacent profession adjacent to game development, and there's writer's in-game development. You can't say it's Saturday. Nah, if something strikes you, you're gonna go write it down. You're not gonna go, nope, it's Saturday. I hope I remember that on Monday to do. No, you write that down, and you quickly learn to go with the flow when creativity hits.

And I also get, though, that game dev isn't life or death. I mean, I got that back when the assistant producer showed up at my door with my computer while I was F dead from chickenpox and strep throat at the same time, saying, "oh, you've got to finish this game." No, I don't. But at the same time, game development does require some dedication that you don't see in other professions. There's a lot of professions you can go in, work your hours, and leave. I don't think making games is like that, and here's why. I'm getting scared of the industry trend to turn games into products. Now, I'll be clear on this: games have always been products, but now they're being made like products. When I see microtransactions or hear about gas—games as a service—it kind of just makes me wince a little because that's product, that's not passion. I don't hear anybody wanting to get into the game industry because they want to do gas, because they want to do microtransactions. That's a way of making money off your game, but it's certainly not a reason to make a game, and things that really shouldn't be impacting you too much during development. I know those people will know you have to think of this from the very beginning, and I'm like, okay, let someone else do that. Hire someone 9-5 and have them think about ways of putting microtransactions in your game. I don't want to do that. That is not game development to me, and I've always viewed game development as much art as science.

And you can't schedule art. You can't have, you can make an assembly line to make a car, to build a car, but I don't think you could assembly line the actual designing of cars. And that's why I would always tell producers, look, I know you want to schedule out my design work, but I can't guarantee I'll have all my design ideas by Friday. I can't guarantee they're all work. I can't

 guarantee we want to cut some or redesign some. I can't guarantee that cutting these, in fact, I almost will guarantee cutting these probably will lead to having breaking other things and having to redesign them. That's a guarantee. So, the best you can do is build buffers into your schedule to hopefully account for those things, but you literally cannot schedule for them. And anybody who says they can, I think, is trying to sell you something. They're probably trying to sell you on a new service or themselves because I've yet to meet a producer who can schedule for creativity, and all the ones that say they can have failed. They've just failed.

So, how do I even conclude this? I'm all for work-life balance, as much as possible. I think it's a good thing. I'm glad people are talking about unions. I think they may be needed. If the companies aren't going to provide work-life balance, then the worker should take it. But you have to realize that not all game development will be possible in nine to five, Monday through Friday, ever. It just doesn't work that way. I think a way of thinking about it is work-life balance most of the time is what you should shoot for, but sacrifice it for periods of time when necessary to take your product from good to great. You know, keep an eye on how much you're sacrificing. The same things go for passion. Try to have passion most of the time. Try to put in stuff you really care about. Try to work on things you care about. But understand that you will have to sacrifice that sometimes when necessary. At some point, your game is being funded, and the people who fund it needed to be done. They need to say, hey, we've got to pick an end date. We have to make commitments to, you know, storefronts and ads and all the things you have to commit to weeks or months in advance, sometimes a year. So occasionally, you have to be willing to sacrifice your passion and go, okay, I'm just going to roll my sleeves and work on this, and I don't think it's the best thing ever, but this thing has to be done. Don't do that too much, but you're gonna have to do it occasionally.

I like to think of this as a pendulum. Everything's a pendulum. Society, social mores, TV shows—we have a lot of zombie shows for a while, now the pendulum's swinging to superheroes, it's a swing somewhere else later. Similarly, for work-life balance and passion, it's a pendulum. Do not let it swing too far into work-life balance, or I guarantee you will have a happy home life and a resume full of mediocre games. Similarly, don't let passion swing too far, or you end up with possibly some good games, maybe not, and you may end up with a lost decade like me.

So, conclusion: work-life balance, good; passion, good. This is not a dichotomy. And that's all the thoughts I think I have on that. So, I hope this gives you some clarification on this, and I hope the next time somebody brings up the work-life passion dichotomy, you can say, "not a dichotomy, two totally different things."

Writing Design Specifications.md
Youtube Link:
https://youtu.be/gmDX1p-WZ7g?si=KqyUIziylECpQnTE

Hi everyone, it's me Tim, and today I want to talk about how to write design specifications. Specifically, I'm going to answer a question from Thor RoR TV who asks:

"I was trying to write a design document for a solo project I'm working on and was wondering if you had any examples of how to properly write a specification that might be given to a programmer or an artist. Also, are there any pitfalls to avoid when writing specifications?"

That is a very good question, Thor RoR TV, and it's also a little hard to answer because there's a wildly huge range of design specifications you might be writing. You might be writing a system mechanic, you might be writing a user interface, you might be writing some narrative guidelines. So, these are all wildly different, but they all pretty much share in common one thing, which is details. You have to get very, very detailed when you get to the specification level, and that is especially true if you're working with anybody who's not in-house because if you plan to use any external groups, whether it's an art group, code group, whatever, you are going to want to have as many details in that specification as possible.

So, rather than try to cover the entire gamut, let me do an example of what I would put in specifications. Let's say you're trying to do a particular weapon that is going to be in your game. The art and programming specifications look totally different, so let me break those into both.

**For the artist**, the first thing you want to let the artist know is what all the different types of weapons are in the game, and this can be a separate document that then you include as a link at the top of any document you do for a particular weapon. The reason the artist needs to know this is you may have a weapon that just says this is a rifle, a two-handed rifle, we're going to specifications later, but under the weapon types, you say well, we're a Sci-Fi game, and we're going to have lasers, and we're going to have plasma weapons, and we're going to have ballistic weapons, and even the ballistic weapons look a little sci-fi like they may have a digital readout of ammo remaining or may have a laser aiming scope. This is important because the artist is going to make this thing look like it belongs in your world. So even though they may be doing one particular weapon, they kind of need to know how it falls into the family of weapons that are going to be in the game. And that document about weapon types, you may also want to talk about weapon looks. So you may say, yes, we have all the different types, but our look is like super slick, far future sci-fi, or clunky mechanical sci-fi, or old-timey Victorian brass and steampunk. You want to have a standard look across all your weapons, and these artists are going to do it.

Then, for that particular weapon specification, you need to include a lot of details. That's my buzzword for this: details, details, details. The artist is going to need to know whether it's a one-handed or two-handed weapon because that will determine what animation to use for firing it. Again, they want to refer to that weapon types document to know how many different animations they're going to need. They may be able to get away with one one-handed animation, but two-handed animations, there may be one like this, there may be one like this, so they'll put their hands in different places. They're going to want to know how is this one held. They're going to need to know things like reload information, how is it reloaded, is it something that pops out the bottom, do they put it, do they have to break open the weapon to reload it, what ammo goes into it because ammo will be a separate item that artists will be making, and you want it to look at least visually sort of like what they're putting into this weapon. They want to know information on how it gets wielded and unwielded, does it just appear in their hand, do the hands go down and then come back up with it, do they reach behind them and pull out something. This is both for what it looks like when you see someone do this, but also when it's first person, and you in a first-person game when you see yourself do it. There will be all kinds of information on how aiming is done with this weapon, is it just fired from the hip, does it have iron sights that you look down, does it have scopes that bring up a whole new screen that magnifies and has crosshairs, all of these. They're going to want some basic timing info, like here's how long it takes to wield the weapon, here's how long it takes to aim it, here's how long it takes to fire it and recover, here's how long it takes to reload it. They'll also probably want to know if there's ever going to be any perks or skills or anything else the player can get that will change that timing because if it's too fast, some animations would be hard to do, and if it's too long, some animations would look really weird if they're really long. So, knowing what that range is will help them decide an animation to use.

They also need to know, speaking of animations, they probably want to know things like what non-combat animations still retain showing the weapon, and what don't. For example, when you're walking with a weapon, it may show the weapon. When you're running with the weapon, it may show it, although I've worked on some games where when you run, the weapon disappears. And then there are animations that certainly never show the weapon, like when you go to pick a lock, the weapon just disappears, and they may want to know, do you want it to disappear, or do you want them to unwield it? Do you then have to add all those timings together to figure out how long will it take to pick a lock? It's unwield, pick, re-wield. Knowing that if someone doesn't have any weapon in their hand, it will use the faster timing, so you have to take all these into account and talk to your artist about it. This is just for one weapon, by the way.

Now, **let's contrast that to what the programmers will want to know** for that exact same weapon. Now, they're going to need weapon animation data. Some of this will come from designers, some will come from artists. For example, you may be in charge of what animation states there are and what the timings are, but the artists will be the ones who say, well, these states can blend to and from these other states, and these can't. Things like when you're holding a weapon, you can blend into aim, or you can immediately blend into fire. Some states are animated, so when you're holding it, it may have an idol where it's there's an animation for the holding, so some of them won't, it'll just be here we go. The programmers will have to know what happens on interrupt. If I'm reloading a weapon, and I get attacked, what's supposed to happen? Does the reload keep happening, and I'm taking damage? Does it blend the taking damage animation with the reload animation? Is the reload halted, and does that

 mean it just immediately goes into the hit, and the reload is gone? Do I still show the weapon on a hit? Does the ammo get reloaded if I'm interrupted in the middle of a reload? Is it partially loaded? Is it fully loaded if it reaches some point in the animation, and zero loaded if it didn't reach that point? So, if you're showing someone shoving in a clip, and after it gets shoved in, they get hit, is it fully reloaded? If they're bringing it up, and they get hit, is it not loaded at all? These are things the programmers are going to want to know.

They also need to know what happens on failure. What happens if the player says they want to reload, and they have no ammo? Does it show something? Does it show the animation start and stop? Does it just go, no ammo? They need to know that. There also has to be a lot of weapon data, and the programmers want to know which one of what of this weapon data needs to be exposed to designers, and by exposed, I mean, they it's available for them either through a tool or through like Unity let you expose variables in the and the structure itself, so it's visible in the Unity inspector. They're going to know what do designers want to expose so they can tweak them, and what do they not want to expose, like this is a value we will decide on, and then it's fixed, and I don't want it available for people to tweak. And these are things like what type of ammo does this weapon take, what's the max ammo it can hold, what does this weapon weigh. There's a lot of data that programmers want to know about weapon use, like what different attacks are available, are there special attacks available, like with a gun, can I pistol whip someone, is there an aim, it can you shoot from the hip, and then also do an aim down sight for a special attack, are there power attacks for this melee weapon, all of these. They want to know, do these have cooldown timers? The cooldown timers, of course, gets us into interface, like what are the mouse and keyboard inputs to do all these actions with the weapon, what is going to be displayed on the HUD for each weapon, do you want the current ammo amount, do you want the maximum ammo amount, do you want the cooldowns for any of the things you can do with this weapon, and how are these going to be displayed, how do these vary by weapon? Again, it may have to go to a link to an interface document which says in general we do this, and then the specific weapon uses these parts of the HUD.

These are just things that that are the basics of what have to be done, and if this sounds like a lot of work, it is, and also, this is where you have to give actual values. You can't say, yeah, this reloads slowly, this one reloads fast. You're going to have to define what slow and fast is, like slow maybe takes 3 to 5 seconds to reload, and fast is less than two seconds to reload. You're going to have to define this here so that the animators and the programmers have some idea of what these ranges are going to be, the animators for doing the animations, and the programmers for I don't know what, like how fast the cooldowns are going to move, and if they display a timer, how big those numbers are, is it one digit, two digits, three digits.

Now, there are some pitfalls you can run into when you're writing these docs, and they basically fall into I think two types. One, you can give not enough info. If you don't give enough details, one of two bad things is going to happen. Either you won't get something that you desperately needed, oh, you forgot to mention that you needed a reload animation, you don't have one now, so reload just, boop, it's kind of magically happen, or if you don't give details, the other bad thing that will happen is the artist or programmer will fill it in for you. So, you're going to get something, you'll get it, but it may not be what you want. So, you may end up with a reload animation that can't be interrupted. Sorry, you didn't say you wanted it to be interrupted, this is not an interruptible animation.

The other pitfall you can run into is you give too much wrong information, and you may wonder how this can be, but like when I mentioned having a link to the different weapon types at the top of each weapon, that's to make it off to one side with the person can refer to it, but if you put that at the top of everyone, it's like those recipes you go to on the internet, like, I'm going to learn how to make fried chicken, and you go to some recipe, and it's someone talking about making fried chicken with their grandmother in West Virginia, and you're like, I just need to know how to make fried chicken. Programmers, if they have to wade through a bunch of lore about a weapon just to get to the cooldown timing information, they're going to hate that specification. In other, you should break down your specifications into clear sections, and some of those sections, like types of weapons you have, could be done once and just linked to, rather than repeat that at the beginning of every single weapon specification. So, if you give too much wrong information, your programmers and artists are either going to not find what they want and miss it, do something wrong, then you get mad at them because the information was there, and they're mad at you because they they felt like they had to dig it out of a section on narrative design, or you will just end up having to use the wrong, whatever they end up doing, it'll be treated like a not enough information problem, and they either you won't get something you need, or you get something you didn't want.

So, that's about that's I think everything I can tell you about how to write a specification, without going into all the different specifications that a game would need. Thor RoR TV, I hope that answered your question.
